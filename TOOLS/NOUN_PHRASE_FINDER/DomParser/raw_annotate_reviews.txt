<These stickers> work like <the review> says  <they> do. <They> stick on great and <they> stay on <the phone>. <They> are <super> stylish and <I> can share <them> with <my sister>.
<This> is <a fantastic case>. Very stylish and protects <my phone>. <<Easy access> to <all buttons and features>>, without <<any loss> of <phone reception>>. But most importantly, <it> doubles <power>, just as promised. <Great buy>.
<This> is <<the first battery case> <I> have had for <my Galaxy S4>>. <The S4> fits very well, is slim and doesn't add <much weight> to <the Galaxy S4>. <It> doubles <the battery life>. <You> can charge either <<the battery>, <the phone> or <both>>. <There> is <<a handy on-off switch> with <leds to indicate <<the level> of <charge>>>>. <The battery case> came on <time> and was packaged well. <Well> worth <the price>.
Performs exactly as <advertised> . <It>ï¿½s very  sturdily built,and provides <<lots> of <boost>> .  <It> does exactly what <it>'s supposed too .<Easy> to insert <phone> in and out . <<Definitely <a 5 star experience>>>. Don't know what <I> would do without <this case>. LOVE <it>.
<The case> is pretty good. <It> <dose> have <<<some scratches> on <<one side> of <the phone>>> but <its every little>>. <<Other> then that <i> like <it>>. <Ive> dropped <my phone> a few times since putting on <the case> and <it> <<didnt break> or <scratch>>. <Ive> gotten <many> complements on <this case> and over <<all> <it> was worth <the few bucks> <I> spent>.
<This case> is afordable and <yes it> peels very easy but <thats> to be expected because <<its> <a dollor>>. <I> bought <mine> from <Electromaster>. <It> snaps on <<fine> for <me>> but if <I> were to drop <my phone> <the phone> would be fine but <the case> would surely be done for. <its> <only a dollar> so do not get <your hopes> up. <it> looks great but <its> for <<show> not for <protection>>. if <you> want <your phone to be protected> go <the extra mile> for <an outter box>.
Received <this> in about <a weeks time>. Very nice actually considering how <cheap the price> was. <It>'s <<a pink/purple> with <black leopard spots>> and has <<a very nice feel> to <it>>. <I> haven't tried to remove <it> yet, but hopefully <it> won't give <me> <<any trouble> when <I> do want to change <covers>>.
<This product> arrived when promised and in <the condition> promised. <It> is <a genuine Blackberry charger>. <It> was brand new and worked perfectly. For <the price>, <I> don't think <you> can ask for <<much more> than <that>>!
Honestly <I> have always loved <this specific model>, since <you> can just take <it> with <<you> on <the road>> not worrying if <you> end up losing <it> or leaving <it> where ever <you> go. Though <it> doesn't exactly meet <the fast> charging <<needs> of <high end phones>>, <it> works pretty well on <<all> of <them>>, <you> just need to be <patient>.
<I>'ve had <this charger> well over <a year> now, and <it> still works perfectly.  <Most chargers> would have broken by <now>.  <The folding blades> make this more portable than <<the chargers> that come with <<some Blackberry models> that have <<adapters> for <different countries>>>>.
<I> purchase <<this> for <<a backup> at <work>>>.  <It> charges <my SGS4>.  <I> would recommend <<this charger> for <the Samsung Galaxy S4>>.
<I> bought <<this> for <my Samsung Charge>>. <It> works perfectly and is built as solidly as <the $20 Verizon charger>. <I> highly recommend <this car charger and thanks> for <the great price>!
<This product> must be miss labeled.  <I> can not get <my Samsung S2 phone> to charge with <this OEM charger>.  <The lights> are on, <the phone> says <its charging> but nothing happens.  <I> am not sure if <I> got <a defective product> but <it> is very upsetting to sit in <<your car> for <hours>> and not see <<you>r phone recharge>.  If you need <<a reliable charger>, <<DO NOT purchase> <this product.If>>> <you> need <<a car charger> for <your Samsung S2>>, <I> would recommend <the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter>.  <It> charges fast and is dependable.
<I> use <<this charger> with <my GS2>> from <Straight Talk>.  <This charger> is working as expected, charges <the phone fine> and seems like <a quality product>, not <<flimsy and cheap feeling> like <some chargers>> <I> have ordered in <the past>.
<I> received <this product> in <<a very timely manner> which was <delightful>, however>, <I> gave <it> as <a gift> and was embarrassed to find out <it> was <a defective item>. <I> was reimbursed for <the product> but would have much rather had <<a product> that worked <the first time>>.
<This charger> doesn't charge <<the battery> of <my Samsung Galaxy S2> (<i9100>)> <<properly.When> <I> connect <it> to <my S2>>, <the screen> gets frozen and <the cell> behaves in <a unusual (abnormal) way>.
<I> think <this case> is <an excellent choice>, since <it> is not so bulky, <the color> is nice, <<the texture> on <the back>> is good for <gripping>, and <it> extends <battery life>. <It>'s <a life saver>, and <there> isn't too much on <<the market> at <<the time> for <this phone>>> so <I> am happy w<it>h it. <<<Bought> both blue and black> for <<me> and <my brother>> right after <we>> got <home> from <the phone store>. Would recommend.
<I> bought <<this> for <<the> at&<<t samsung galaxy s2> and <the seller>>>> was very slow in getting <this item> to <me>. <I> also notice that <this product> do fit <the SGS2>, but <the cut outs> was NOT good. <<The> cut out <opening>> was too small for <the power button>, <there> was <also an extra cut out> for <no reason>. <It> does fit nice so <I> gave <it> <2 stars>, but <<bad opening> for <my phone>> will be costly.
<I> bought <this micro usb cable> because <it> was cheap, and that <it> is. <I> use <<this> with <my Nexus>> s <<4g> from <sprint>> and although <it> does indeed charge <my device> <it> causes <<some major issues>, such as <<screen lag>, <<my computer> not being able to recognize what kind of <device> <this> is, and causing <my phone to constantly jump into <car mode>>>>>. So if <you> need <<a real quick cable> for <<basic> charging>>, <this> will do <it>, <anything> else...spend <the extra buck> on <a higher end cable>.
<This charger> doesn't work very well. When plugged in, <it> shows that <it> is charging, but after <ten minutes> <I>'m lucky to get <1%> more on <my battery>. <I> only use <it> now if <my battery> is low and <I> want to keep <it> from getting <lower>...<that>'s really <<all> <it>'s good for>.
