{This {wall mount}} does everything {it>1}'s supposed to do.  (The piece) that attaches to (the wall) isn't overly long, which made [it>3] easier to mount [the arm] in the tight space I needed to mount {it>1} in.  The only issues I saw was that (the joints) were VERY tight initially and as we moved [the arm] around to install {it}, {the [joints]} loosened up to [the point] where I had to take (the included [allen wrench]) and tighten (them) up again.

{This mount} works really well once you get {it>0} up and going.  Only problem is just [the arms] are a little goofy getting [them>2] all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big (an issue) considering (all the different TV's) and [their mounting hole locations].

{This mount} is just what I needed.  {It>0} is strong and sturdy.  {It>0} folds almost flat to enable {the television} to sit square and flat against {the wall} if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  {A perfect fit} as long as you match {the correct visa pattern} for {your television>3}.
