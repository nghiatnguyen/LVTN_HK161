<COREF ID="0" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">This <COREF ID="1" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">wall mount</COREF></COREF> does everything <COREF ID="2" REF="1" TYPE="OBJ">it</COREF>'s supposed to do.  <COREF ID="3" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">The piece</COREF> that attaches to <COREF ID="4" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">the wall</COREF> isn't overly long, which made <COREF ID="5" REF="3" TYPE="ATTR">it</COREF> easier to mount <COREF ID="6" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">the arm</COREF> in the tight space I needed to mount <COREF ID="7" REF="1" TYPE="OBJ">it</COREF> in.  The only issues I saw was that <COREF ID="8" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">the joints</COREF> were VERY tight initially and as we moved <COREF ID="9" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">the arm</COREF> around to install <COREF ID="10" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">it</COREF>, <COREF ID="11" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">the <COREF ID="12" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">joints</COREF></COREF> loosened up to <COREF ID="13" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">the point</COREF> where I had to take <COREF ID="14" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">the included <COREF ID="15" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">allen wrench</COREF></COREF> and tighten <COREF ID="16" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">them</COREF> up again.

<COREF ID="0" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">This mount</COREF> works really well once you get <COREF ID="1" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">it</COREF> up and going.  Only problem is just <COREF ID="2" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">the arms</COREF> are a little goofy getting <COREF ID="3" REF="2" TYPE="ATTR">them</COREF> all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big <COREF ID="4" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">an issue</COREF> considering <COREF ID="5" REF="0" TYPE="OTHER">all the different TV's</COREF> and <COREF ID="6" REF="0" TYPE="ATTR">their mounting hole locations</COREF>.

<COREF ID="0" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">This mount</COREF> is just what I needed.  <COREF ID="1" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">It</COREF> is strong and sturdy.  <COREF ID="2" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">It</COREF> folds almost flat to enable <COREF ID="3" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">the television</COREF> to sit square and flat against <COREF ID="4" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">the wall</COREF> if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  <COREF ID="5" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">A perfect fit</COREF> as long as you match <COREF ID="6" REF="0" TYPE="OBJ">the correct visa pattern</COREF> for <COREF ID="7" REF="3" TYPE="OBJ">your television</COREF>.
