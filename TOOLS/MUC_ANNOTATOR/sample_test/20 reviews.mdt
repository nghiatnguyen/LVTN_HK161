{These stickers} work like <the review> says  {>0they} do. {>0They} stick on great and {>0they} stay on <the phone>. {>0They} are <super> stylish and <I> can share {>0them} with <my sister>.
{This} is {>0a fantastic case}. Very stylish and protects <my phone>. <<Easy access> to <all buttons and features>>, without <<any loss> of <phone reception>>. But most importantly, {>0it} doubles <power>, just as promised. <Great buy>.
{This} is {>0<the first battery case> <I> have had for {my Galaxy S4}}. {>0The S4} fits very well, is slim and doesn't add [much weight] to the {>4Galaxy S4}. {>0It} doubles [the battery life]. <You> can charge either <<the battery>, <the phone> or <both>>. <There> is [[a handy on-off switch] with leds to indicate <<the level> of <charge>>]. {>0The battery case} came on <time> and was packaged well. <Well> worth [the price].
Performs exactly as <advertised> . {It}’s very  sturdily built,and provides <<lots> of <boost>> .  {>1It} does exactly what {>1it}'s supposed too .<Easy> to insert <phone> in and out . [Definitely [>9a 5 star experience]]. Don't know what <I> would do without {>1this case}. LOVE {>1it}.
{The case} is pretty good. {It>0} <dose> have <<<some scratches> on <<one side> of {the phone}>> but its every little>. <Other> then that <i> like {>0it}. <Ive> dropped <my phone> a few times since putting on {the case} and <it> <didnt break> or <scratch>. <Ive> gotten <many> complements on {this case} and over <all> <it> was worth <the few bucks> <I> spent.
{This case} is afordable and {>0yes it} peels very easy but <thats> to be expected because <<its> <a dollor>>. <I> bought <mine> from <Electromaster>. {>0It} snaps on <<fine> for <me>> but if <I> were to drop <my phone> <the phone> would be fine but {>0the case} would surely be done for. <its> <only a dollar> so do not get <your hopes> up. {>0it} looks great but {>0its} for <<show> not for <protection>>. if <you> want <your phone to be protected> go <the extra mile> for <an outter box>.
Received {this} in about <a weeks time>. Very nice actually considering how [cheap the price] was. {It}'s {>0<a pink/purple> with <black leopard spots>} and has {>0a very nice feel to {>0it}}. <I> haven't tried to remove {it} yet, but hopefully {it} won't give <me> <<any trouble> when <I> do want to change <covers>>.
{This product} arrived when promised and in <the condition> promised. {>0It} is {>0a genuine Blackberry charger}. {It>0} was brand new and worked perfectly. For [the price], <I> don't think <you> can ask for <<much more> than [that]>!
Honestly <I> have always loved {this specific model}, since <you> can just take {>it} with <<you> on <the road>> not worrying if <you> end up losing {>1it} or leaving {>1it} where ever <you> go. Though {>1it} doesn't exactly meet [the fast] charging <<needs> of <high end phones>>, {>1it} works pretty well on <<all> of <them>>, <you> just need to be <patient>.
<I>'ve had {this charger} well over <a year> now, and {>1it} still works perfectly.  <Most chargers> would have broken by <now>.  [The folding blades] make this more portable than <<the chargers> that come with <<some Blackberry models> that have <<adapters> for <different countries>>>>.
<I> purchase <{this} for <<a backup> at <work>>>.  {>2It} charges <my SGS4>.  <I> would recommend <{>2this charger} for <the Samsung Galaxy S4>>.
<I> bought <{this} for <my Samsung Charge>>. {>2It} works perfectly and is built as solidly as <the 20 Verizon charger>. <I> highly recommend {>2this car charger and thanks} for [the great price].
{This product} must be miss labeled.  <I> can not get <my Samsung S2 phone> to charge with {>0this OEM charger}.  <The lights> are on, <the phone> says <its charging> but nothing happens.  <I> am not sure if <I> got <a defective product> but {>0it} is very upsetting to sit in <<your car> for <hours>> and not see <your phone recharge>.  If <you> need <<a reliable charger>, DO NOT purchase {>0this product}>.If <you> need <<a car charger> for <your Samsung S2>>, <I> would recommend {the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter}.  {It} charges fast and is dependable.
<I> use <{this charger} with <my GS2>> from <Straight Talk>.  {>2This charger} is working as expected, charges <the phone fine> and seems like {>2a quality product}, not <<flimsy and cheap feeling> like <some chargers>> <I> have ordered in <the past>.
<I> received {this product} in <<a very timely manner> which was <delightful>, however>, <I> gave {>1it} as <a gift> and was embarrassed to find out {>1it} was {>1a defective item}. <I> was reimbursed for {>1the product} but would have much rather had <{>1a product} that worked <the first time>>.
{This charger} doesn't charge <<the battery> of <my Samsung Galaxy S2> (<i9100>)> <<properly.When> <I> connect {>0it} to <my S2>>, <the screen> gets frozen and <the cell> behaves in <a unusual (abnormal) way>.
<I> think <this case} is {>1an excellent choice}, since {>1it} is not so bulky, [the color] is nice, [[the texture] on <the back>] is good for <gripping>, and {>1it} extends <battery life>. {>1It}'s {>1a life saver}, and <there> isn't too much on <<the market> at <the time> for <this phone>> so <I> am happy with {>1it}. <<<Bought> both blue and black> for <<me> and <my brother>> right after <we>> got <home> from <the phone store>. Would recommend.
<I> bought <{this} for <<the> <at&t <samsung galaxy s2> and <the seller>>>> was very slow in getting {>2this item} to <me>. <I> also notice that {>2this product} do fit <the SGS2>, but [the cut outs] was NOT good. [<The> cut out <opening>] was too small for <the power button>, <there> was [also an extra cut out] for <no reason>. {>2It} does fit nice so <I> gave {>2it} {>22 stars}, but <<bad opening> for <my phone>> will be costly.
<I> bought {this micro usb cable} because {>1it} was cheap, and that {>1it} is. <I> use <{1this} with <my Nexus>> s <<4g> from <sprint>> and although {>1it} does indeed charge <my device> {>1it} causes <<some major issues>, such as <<screen lag>, <<my computer> not being able to recognize what kind of <device> {>1this} is, and causing <my phone to constantly jump into <car mode>>>>>. So if <you> need <<a real quick cable> for <<basic> charging>>, {>1this} will do <it>, <anything> else...spend <the extra buck> on <a higher end cable>.
{This charger} doesn't work very well. When plugged in, {>0it} shows that {>0it} is charging, but after <ten minutes> <I>'m lucky to get <1%> more on <my battery>. <I> only use {>0it} now if <my battery> is low and <I> want to keep <it> from getting <lower>...<that>'s really <<all> {>0it's good for>.
