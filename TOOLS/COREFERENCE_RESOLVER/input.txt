I love this phone! I was debating between the regular S5 and the S5 Active phone, and I'm so glad I chose the Active. I've dropped my phone some times already and not even a dent or scratch on it.
I upgraded from an S3 and am very happy with my S5. I only have a couple of complaints, the first of which is the replacement of the menu/options button with a recent apps button. This was already easily accessible by holding the home button for about 1 second so I'm not sure why it needed its own dedicated button. My other complaint is the size. It no longer fits comfortably in my pocket or car drink holder but then again, I knew it was big when I ordered and got it for its supposed durability. Overall, it's a great phone with a bright, crisp display and fast processor.
I have only been using this Galaxy S5 for a few days so far, but I have tweaked all the settings and checked out all of the features. My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, so I skipped a few generations in between there. The S5 Active phone is definitely a huge improvement over the S2! My only disappointment with this phone, and it is very minor, is that I had thought the black bumpers around the edges were going to be more rubberized. They are not. They are hard, matte plastic. It makes me think that if it were to hit the ground hard enough, those black pieces would crack. I will probably end up buying a case of some sort, just for a little extra protection.
I just received the S5 on Saturday so I haven't had a chance to get to most of it but this is the best phone I've ever owned. I'm a musician and the music player is superb and this is the first phone with a strong Bluetooth. I can't get it to disconnect to either my Active2 ear buds or my Sony DR-BT50 over the ear headphones. Every other phone I've owned, a Behold, Exhibit and two Galaxy SII's all disconnect if you get a body part in the way. I'm finally happy with BLUETOOTH. The phone's screen is beautiful and there aren't many HD Glass protector's yet that are affordable. I purchased a SUPCASE for it but it made it to large and heavy for me so I returned it and am waiting for an Exact Soft Gel skin to protect it as it is somewhat slippery to the touch. I've owned two different Galaxy SII's and this is blazing fast compared to those two. It seems a bit more user friendly also. I'll update this when I have more to say but for now.
I bought a refurbished version of this S5. Never again will I buy anything electronic that has been refurbished. It was great at first, but now, only 5 months of having it, had developed extremely annoying issues. Some of which are costing me time doing my job. At times, the Internet connection dies and the icon disappears from the status bar (even with a solid digital signal). It does not return on its own. I have to restart the phone each time. Average rate of occurrence is twice weekly. But now, in the last couple of days, the speaker will not play any sound at all. Especially for the price it cost. Never ever again.
This S5 is little, fast and it has crystal clear screen and voice. Plusly it’s easy to use. I have vision and hearing loss. This phone is great for people like me when set up to Easy mode. Battery life is outstanding, add wireless charging, no cables to mess with, just pick it up and talk! YES! I am blown away to say the least! Lastly my iPhone friends have all fallen in love with it. Added a clear case from Amazon. Buy this phone!
My S5 is an excellent phone with dual sim capability. This phone seems to be intended for middle eastern market. One disadvantage of this phone is that it does not support Samsung pay, which is only supported on the US models of S7. Other than that, everything is exactly the same. The US model does not offer dual sim capability. The phone came in a completely sealed box and the box had no signs that indicated that it was opened before being shipped out.
The S7 is a very good smartphone. It is exactly what I expected and works fine with my carrier in USA (T Mobile) and outside US too. However, the slot for the 2 Sim card is the same that carries the expandable memory. So you will not be able to use the memory at the same time with the 2 Sim cards. This is very disappointing! In the S5 with double Sim card, you're able to have both Sim cards and expanded memory working all together.
I've owned many different phones over the years. My first real smart phone was a Samsung S3 and was a great phone. I recently purchased a S7 Edge phone and can say it is the best phone I've ever had. I recommend getting the International version like mine. All the chatter about it on the Web is spot on. It is the fastest, smoothest, best of everything in a smart phone that money can buy today. My only complaint is that TouchWiz needs more work. I really want to use it but ended up back to Nova launcher to get basic features, like vertical app drawer scroll and such. TouchWiz needs more features control to truly be useful. However, this has nothing to do with how wonderful the S7 Edge International 935FD truly is!
I upgraded to the S5 from a Galaxy Note 3 and it is loads better - faster; better screen; much better camera. The display is so clear and colorful, it is simply a joy to hold and behold. Any drawbacks? You do have to hold it carefully so you aren't pressing the wrap-around screen and confusing it with what you want to do. Worth it? You bet.
I purchased this Galaxy S5 to replace my malfunctioning HTC One M7. At first glance I have to say the screen is gorgeous. I have watched Youtube videos and other short clips and was amazed at the crisp color and motion. When taking photos, the pictures were nice. When I zoomed in on the phone I did start to notice some minor pixelation so I will most likely stick to my Sony DSLR if I really what to take distant shots. I have a few games that I play and the controls are seamless and react with un-noticeable delays. I have used the fingerprint login for my phone but I can’t get it to consistently work. Calls are clear and I like the volume boost option although it is disabled for my Bluetooth headphones. The battery life is fair with the phone. Overall, I am highly impressed with this product and I am hopeful that it will last for many years to come.
Everything you've read about this S5 is true. It is amazing. The screen is second only to the S7, the camera is arguably the best on the market, and it is a monster in battery life and performance. Silver Titanium is undoubtedly the best color. Absolutely stunning. If Samsung found a way to implement stereo audio, it would be perfect, but it makes up for what it lacks in sound quality in its relative loudness and top of the line headphone output. Rest assured that you are buying the best phone on the market right now.
This is the best cell phone I have. The size is almost the same as Samsung S5, except the format edge give us a very pleasant touch and view! The camera is exceptional, have auto focus and it is impossible to have bad pictures. The only problem is that it is so sensitive that a single harder touch can become multiple pictures. This is definitely the best Samsung S series phone, and if the money is not the problem, forget the S7 and go to the S7 Edge phone!
The phone itself works nice, very smooth and lots of storage. I've already dropped my LG several times and it has not cracked. It's very durable. The biggest drawback is definitely the camera. It's absolute garbage. If you're not looking to take high quality photos, then this is a really great phone overall. But if you’re looking to take really nice pictures, I'd keep looking for something else.
I upgraded to the LG Stylo 2 from my old Galaxy S3 and I have been very happy with the LG. I spent time comparing it to the other available Virgin phones, and the Samsung J7 is closest in specs, but significantly more expensive. For me the large screen was the biggest selling point and that coupled with the lower price sold me on the Stylo 2. This phone is very responsive, quick, and an all-round good performer. Battery life is superb, I can keep that big screen on for hours and still have 60-70% charge. And the phone has sufficient on-board memory to hold plenty of apps, photos, and music.
Loving my Stylo 2 with Virgin Mobile. It is everything I was expecting and more. Wonderfully large format screen, good resolution, great camera and plenty of storage (an issue with my previous phone). The phone is quick, responsive and the audio quality is first rate. The incredibly slim design really necessitates a good case with some grip or you could easily loose hold of it. I got a lovely fold over case that is doing the job beautifully. I couldn't be happier with this phone. Excellent, and I mean excellent value for the cost!
Stylo 2 is great. Nice big screen. Battery could be better and camera is ok. Wifi works good. Talk is good and clear. Wireless charging would be nice. Overall a great phone for the price. If you are looking for a fast processor phone, this is not for you. You need to pay the higher price for a better phone but if you do a few apps and few games you will be ok.
Good upgrade from the first Stylo. It has some features that the Stylo 1 did not. This includes more internal memory. I would say if you have the Stylo 1, the Stylo 2 may take time to grow on you as some features are different. Either phone is great but the Stylo 2 has doubled the internal memory than the Stylo 1. I would recommend either phone and Virgin Mobile.
Stylo 2 is a great phone. It is very fast with plenty of storage for apps. SD card slot is good for storing music, videos, and pictures. I thought the camera was fine for a phone. The screen looks great for a 5.7 inch. Sound was loud and ok. Stylus is a plus and works well. Only one thing I see maybe a problem is screen may break very easy on even small drops. I got a heavy duty case to protect it. I did play a few games on it with no problems. Phone also has an easy mode that is good for people that don't like a lot of confusion and tend to get frustrated with technology.
Stylo is great. I love the size and clarity of the screen. Takes great HD pics. Would definitely recommend for the price and shipping was fast. Battery lasts me all day and I am always on phone. Phone storage is a small amount but get the 32gb SD card and you will be fine.
I like the Galaxy Note 4 because it is neat and has good features. I left it by accident in my car and the heat caused the screen to go white. Fortunately, I removed the battery and cooled down the phone. When I put it back together, it worked perfectly. I also dropped it once and it was surprisingly sturdy although I plan never to let that happen again. I plan to have this phone for a while! I would recommend it.
This phone is very slim, cute and easy to use. Galaxy Note 4 is a flip phone and can be opened easily with one hand. Setting up this phone was a piece of cake. It came with an adaptor plug which can fit any A/C plug. The only negative is that it didn't come with a driver CD and a data cable. A big plus was that it was unlocked and was able to accept any SIM card. Great phone!
The Galaxy Note 4 is an awesome, capable, gorgeous phone. It can do so much. From business to gaming, it covers at all. The screen is gorgeous. The CPU is fast. You can add storage space (unlike the Note5) I got mine for a killer price and I love it!
I recently got the Note 4 and have been using it for a week and it works pretty well. It came in really clean and I only saw one tiny scratch but it wasn't really noticeable at all. I love my new phone and plus, I got it for a cheap price while it looked brand new! However, the screen was kind of weird appearing because it had a little faded label inside of it? But that wasn't really noticeable. Overall, I think this phone has all 5 stars of functionality, appearance, and shipment too! I really recommend this to the other customers and they won't regret on buying it!
The Note 4 is a great phone. I really love the camera and the stylus. I have not had many problems. The only problem I had was with the battery, it would not hold a charge, but the seller sent me a new battery and it works great! I have taken many photos and they all turned out great. The front facing camera has a built in face tuning software so it helps with hiding blemishes and does it automatically, but you can turn it off if you do not want it. I love how fast the phone is and it’s great for playing games, watching movies and everything. The 2K screen is amazing; movies, TV shows, YouTube and Netflix all look great on the screen. The screen is very responsive and fast moving, I actually enjoy the Touchwiz UI (User Interface). I do not have any complaints about this phone, I really love it and enjoy using it. I highly recommend this phone for anyone who is thinking about getting one.
I've been very pleased with this phone so far, the camera is great, the screen is very clear and easy to read. If you like big phones, the Galaxy Note 4 is the phone for you. I've had a few times where the screen would just go black, but it's just the app closing down, so I'm not sure about that. The phone had little to no scratches, in great condition. I'm glad I got it! And such a good price, too.
I've been using the Note 4 for three weeks now. It's a bit large but the screen size is very easy on my eyes. Operations are very quick and I appreciate having the 3 GB of memory. Haven't used the stylus yet, but I have used one on the Note 10.1, so I believe it will work the same. This is a refurbished phone and despite some scratches on the back surface, it looks good. I have housed it in a decent case to protect it, which added some weight, but overall I am very pleased with this phone.
The Galaxy Note 4 is my current phone. I switched from the Galaxy S5 which by the way is my favorite phone I have ever owned. The Note 4 is a great phone, but compared to the S5 it falls short in many ways. The first being durability. I was comfortable carrying my S5 around without a case, I am an outdoors man and I had no worries of dropping the phone on the ground or in a river. The Note 4 is less durable and I find myself uncomfortable carrying it without a case on it. If you are in the market for a multitasking, S pen writing, large screen phone then the Note 4 is the choice for you! If you are looking for a more durable phone with a smaller screen then I say take a look at the S5.
I upgraded to the Note 4 three weeks ago from Galaxy S5, and I love this phone! I was a little concerned about the size, but now that I have had it for a while, it does not seem that big! The screen is beautiful and it is super fast! I have used the S pen a little, but not that into it yet. I am still learning all the bells and whistles, but from what I have learned so far I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the it is better than the IPhone 6Plus! Great phone! Great specs! Great camera! And excellent battery life! I highly recommend it!
Note 4 is a great phone! The speed of the processor is amazing. I have used IPhones and they do not even come close to this device. Android's OS paired with this device has made my life so much easier. The large screen size is great for my over 50 eyes! Do not get an IPhone, get a Samsung Note 4!
I love my Galaxy Note 4. I came from a LG G3 and it is by far the better phone. The battery life is really good for as large of a screen as it has and even when I use my mobile Hotspot function, it doesn't drain as rapidly as other phone had in the past.
I've had my IPhone 6Plus since launch and it's served me very well. It fits my hand perfectly and trying to use a smaller phone now makes me feel like a giant. It's very fast and the 128 GB has lots of storage. The only problem is recently the touch screen hasn't been registering touch at times. The phone is almost two years old and I'm not exactly gentle with it, so I don't really blame the phone. Still a great phone.
I have been using the Nexus 6 for almost 2 years now. Although the actual size of the phone can be intimidating, I absolutely cannot live without it. The larger screen makes it almost like having a mini iPad and phone all in one. I actually use it like a personal computer most days. Surfing the net, using apps, watching videos and face time are all so much easier with the larger screen. Everything runs smoothly as long as you keep up with the software updates and don't use up all the storage. Battery life is great, be sure to use the factory Apple charger, as other ones don't seem to charge as fast. Keeping a screen protector and case is also a must, as the screen can be cracked. Overall I would recommend this phone over all other IPhones and definitely over Android devices. The ease of use cannot be beat!
It's not worth its price. The Motorola Google Nexus 6 is better and a lot faster and it's a bit less expensive than this crappy phone. The point is that this phone even does not have a Full HD Screen and it only has 1 GB RAM and 1.4 GHZ Processor and only 401 pixels per inch. The Nexus 6 is a lot faster than this phone and better as a daily driver.
The IPhone 6Plus is a huge phone! It can be bully to carry, or even just using it in your hand. But there are many features to out weight this. Coming from the IPhone 5s I still see a major increase in CPU and graphics power. Another amazing feature about this phone is the camera. Although it is only 8 megapixels, it still can take better pictures than most of its Android competitors. The battery life on this phone is amazing. I can go all day on heavy use with lots of apps, web, and texting and still end the day with 40% battery. Doing that on my IPhone 5s was impossible. I would usually have to charge in the early afternoon on days like that. Since buying this I don't feel that I need to use my iPad as much. There are some apps that don't work on the phone so I have to use the iPad but probably at least 75% of my web browsing and amazon shopping is done on this device.
I didn't think I would like this IPhone; I was perfectly fine with my IPhone 4s. But I needed a new phone because it's been 5 years so I went and saw this phone and played with it. I thought it was too big before but the IPhone 6 is a perfect size. I love the bigger screen and the gold color. Beautiful phone. I just wish they would drop the 16GB and start with 32GB instead, don't really wanna pay an extra 100$ for 64GB and it's too much for me. Other than that I would recommend this phone.
The iPhone 6Plus is the best phone on the market. From start to finish, this phone rocks all day long. The battery life is great, even with very heavy use. The camera is unmatched. It may only be 8MP, but the software makes a huge difference. You've seen all the reviews on the device, so what I really want to say is that it's really not too big for daily use. When not compared side by side to another IPhone, people constantly believe it's the smaller version.
I am very happy with this IPhone 6Plus! I wasn't sure about getting an IPhone because I wasn't very happy with the IPhone 5, especially when they decided to change all the chargers and adapters for it, but I went with my gut and couldn't be happier! The screen is big and I love that and it's very fast. The pictures are super clear and there isn't a delay when taking the pictures. It is loud enough to listen to music throughout the house and not have to have it on a dock as well. Very happy with this phone.
It's ridiculous how big the iPhone 6Plus is. It is bigger than the Note 4. It slips easily from your hands because of its body. It is also riddled with issues. My family bought this and had to return it the next day because it was having software issues and it was lagging. It's a fashion phone. If you actually want to do more with your phone and be productive, I highly suggest it's competitor, the Note 4.
Love my IPhone 6Plus. It is a little hard to hold the phone in the right angel to hear from the earpiece at first. I found myself using my Bluetooth more often now than I ever have. Other than that this phone is just so beautiful. Picture quality is great. Watching a movie or browsing on the web, photos and video are excellent. No issue with texting with small hands. My daughter has been using my iPad 2 for a while and I have no need to use it now with this big screen phone. It has a very fast processor, no regret at all. Absolutely love it.
I currently have this iPhone 6Plus and it works great, it's fast and the finger print works great. I have dropped it so many times and nothing has happened. I spilled some water on it and to this day, it still works. It's just a great phone.
I can't believe this IPhone 6Plus outperformed the Samsung Galaxy S7 that it is much faster and even the camera quality is much clearer and sharper than the Samsung Galaxy S7. Even the durability is so much better than the Samsung, not a crack or scratch. The screen is so much bigger and sharper than the Samsung, the Samsung S7 is a crappy Windows phone and the IPhone has more apps. Even it is thinner and lighter. Even the speaker has more bass and much louder than the Samsung S7!
I've used the Galaxy phones for years - always hearing the bad things people said about IPhones. Well, since finally trying out the IPhone this year, I have to say I'm a convert. I love this iPhone SE! It works with all the apps I use for work. Screen is crisp, clear. It's quick. Photos and video is perfect. I will now never buy any other phone than an IPhone.
I really love this IPhone SE. It sure is the same size as the IPhone 5s but it has same features as the IPhone 6 and same speed. I bought one and it's amazing. It's for an affordable price and is pretty fast.
Iphone SE is great, it is very fast and has a lot of storage. It has a perfect shape and nice looking edges and curves. The phone also has an innovative fingerprint scanner which is great for quick unlocking. It also has a great operating system and home screen has great virus protection and will not get any malware. It has a nice speaker and camera takes great pictures. The phone just looks amazing and it is better than any other phone that I've seen and or used. It also has a bright flashlight, the battery lasts very long and the battery usually won't need replacement.
I tried this SE out today and I think it is a great phone. It's fast like my IPhone 6s but smaller, I liked the IPhone 5s size. I had the IPhone 5s and loved it but then updated to the IPhone 6a. The SE looks just like the IPhone 5s but with more speed. The camera is like my IPhone 6s. So if you want to go back to having a phone that fits in your pocket, this is the one!
I was curious about purchasing this M8 because of the negative reviews about the camera. But I decided to get it for my girlfriend, she wanted a Galaxy S5 at first but the moment she got the M8 she said it's the best phone ever. This phone attracts attention were ever she. Goes I love this phone, it's so fast and smooth. We wouldn't mind getting another.
I love my Note 3, it's bigger than my S3 but it's not as big as the mega phone but it's just right for me, I haven't learned everything about the phone but I do love the pen that comes with the phone, it does a lot. The camera is nice and much clearer.
I've had several phones throughout my life and the Note 3 is the best phone I've had. Easy to use as oppose to some smart phones that are too complicated or a bunch of unusable features. It takes great pictures, the keyboard is easy to use, and I love the pre-installed apps by Samsung. Great phone!
I love my Note 3. It has a great camera. I would recommend it to anyone. I'm still learning what I can do with this phone. I like the S-pen for taking quick notes.
The best phone I ever had, I love the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I don't use my iPad as much anymore. I would recommend this phone to all my friends.
I'm so impressed with this phone. It is easy to learn and it does so much more than what I expected. I would recommend the Note 3 to anyone. This is my first smart phone and before I was doubtful that I could learn it. I looked at many phones and this one was the one for me. I love the screen, the design, and easy handling. Thank you.
The Note 3 is a lot bigger than my HTC EVO but somehow it's lighter. It's very fast and has so many features that an IPhone5 can't touch. I love the camera features and it takes great pictures. This is the best smart phone on the market.
For the most part, The Note 3 is everything the other people said. It's a great phone, sound quality is good and I love the large screen. My only issue is the screen is actually too sensitive. This is actually because of air motion feature. Even without touching the screen, the phone still 'auto pushes' numbers while on the call. I have to be sure to turn the keyboard off while on the call.
The Note 3 looks big when it is put together with other phones, but it is fine when I hold it in my hand. After a while, I can even use one hand to operate it. It is so convenience to punch the keypad and write on it. The resolution is so high and images are so colorful. There are still so many functions that I need to explore. Due to the big screen, I paid more to buy a explosion proof screen protector but it is worth. Fantastic phone!
I was use to the Galaxy S series phones and after a while they got slow and laggy for no reason. The battery life on older those S series phones got worse over time. The Note 3 on the other hand is still going strong, it chargers really fast, and sometimes I can go through the day without charger it until night time.
I had the Samsung Galaxy S3. It worked how I expected it to. Then one of my friends at work purchased the Note 3. I played with a few of the new features and told myself get it. I haven't regretted it. It's not as big as most people think. It's just a lot bigger than most phones, but fits in my pockets with no problem.
I really love this Samsung Galaxy S3. The screen is fantastic, the design is slick, it's fast, it's responsive, and stock Android 5-6 runs like a dream. The camera is superb both photo quality and video quality wise. Battery life is pretty good, lasts about 8 hours with active use and about 2 days with moderate use, and it charges really fast. Only real drawback is that it has no SD-card slot, but that's ok. 32GB is, so far, mostly enough for me. You can connect a USB flash stick to the OTG port if you must have more storage on the go, maybe you'd want to get the 64GB model. Honestly I would say this is better than an IPhone 6 in most respects. The big screen kind of makes it hard (or rather impossible) to handle it with one hand, in most cases, and it makes me a bit paranoid of dropping it when i pull it out of my pocket. But on the other hand I love the extra screen real-estate, makes my sausage fingers feel right at home.
I initially loved the S3. The software and operating system are great and it is fast. However, the phone is very slippery and because it is so large, it slips easily. This is a huge problem because the screen shatters easily. I have owned many phones and have been very rough with them, yet never have I had a screen break. I purchased a cover and protective glass and yet with a minor drop the glass shattered.
I upgraded to this Nexus 6 after having a Galaxy S5 for about two years. The S5 was a great phone, but I got frustrated with some stutters and slowdowns that would occur randomly. I purchased the Nexus 6 since it has stock Android and does not have any overlays that would slow it down. After having the phone for about 3 months, I can say that I am very impressed. The phone consistently performs well, the battery life lasts me over a day with moderate use, and the fast charging has come in handy more than once when I am low on battery. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a phone at a reasonable price point with great, even performance.
Bought the Nexus 6 during black Friday to replace my aging S4. Everything about it is better than the S4 except video recording. The Nexus 6 has a horrible video camera. It cannot focus on moving objects. I like to take videos for Instagram and this phone is absolute trash when it comes to videos. It constantly tries to focus and this leads to blurry videos. Besides the video problem, the phone is great. The phone has longer battery life than the S4 and also much faster.
I was a bit worried that the phone would be too big. Honestly, The Nexus 6 is a bit bigger than most phones but I can tell you that within 5 minutes I got use to the size and I absolutely love my phone. The screen is big enough for everything and the speakers are awesome. I am happy I made the decision to get this instead of the Nexus 5. I don't think I need a phone smaller than the Nexus 6 right now.
The Nexus 6 is an amazing phone. Completely customizable in almost every possible way. Being unlocked, you're not stuck in a contract with any of the big carriers. I originally used straight talk but switched to Google Fi, which is pretty amazing! The phone has a great forward facing camera and a reasonable self shot camera as well. The screen is large enough to watch videos with friends. The only downfall of the phone is that it is almost too big. While the size is great for some things, it is a hindrance to carry around and near impossible to use one handed. I knew it would be big before I bought it, but I didn't realize exactly how big! I suggest playing with one before purchasing, but I still recommend this phone, I thoroughly enjoy mine.
Honestly, I love the Nexus 6 but sometimes the speaker volume is very low even when it's turned up. It happens even when I am in a very quiet place. Also my battery does not last for 24 hours, it last for about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, it charges super fast, takes great pictures and overall is very fast.
After 2 amazing years with my Nexus 5, it was utterly destroyed. Lucky for me, Amazon had a great price on the Nexus 6. It's been amazing. The screen is huge. Honestly, I like the size, web pages are a pleasure to view, and use. I loved the battery life on my previous Nexus, but this phone is amazing. The screen is bright. The phone feels amazing in hand. I don't think you could ever go wrong with Nexus devices.
Nexus 6 is an awesome phone! My previous phone was a HTC One, which was rated the best phone in the world by Techradar when I bought it in 2013. So when I dropped the HTC and the screen cracked, I was looking for upgrade. At $299 (from Amazon), the Nexus 6 seemed to be a huge downgrade. But not after a few months of using it, I love this phone. It does everything that a high-end Android smartphone is supposed to do. What this phone does better than almost everyone else is: this guy has a huge screen. A few months with this phone and I realized, I have reduced my tablet usage a lot. I read all news on the phone, watch Youtube on the phone and so on. And it is not one bit uncomfortable on my hand. I think this phone is a bargain.
I got the Nexus 6 for my mom and it's really awesome. The display quality is great. The screen size is big. The battery life is very good. No bloatware--just Android in its pure form. HD Audio Calling on T-Mobile works like a charm. Front facing camera quality could be better but at this price point it's very acceptable. Rear facing images are good but not great when compared to leading flagships phones. Most people will be very satisfied with the image quality. I give it an 7.5 per 10 compared to an IPhone 6S.
Nexus 6 is an amazing phone for $250. I wanted to get the Nexus 6P but to be honest the Nexus 6 still does an amazing job. Compare to the price of the Nexus 6P, this is a better deal. Fast charging, wireless charging, great speed, amazing display, latest OS marshmallow 6.0.1 and an ok camera, you can't go wrong with this phone. I guess the biggest con is the cameras, rear is ok but the front is just awful.
Nexus 6 is excellent. I love the speakers on the front, and the large screen is great. I went from an HTC One M7 to this phone, and I was worried about it being too big. It isn't. It fits nicely in the hand, and I can slip it into my jeans without issue. It is fast and capable, and the camera is nice. I also haven't yet received the Android 6.0 update for some reason, but I'm really picking nits here. This is a great phone at a great price, and I highly recommend it.
The Nexus 6 is a great phone, but is not for everyone. Firstly, it is huge. This is a reason I wanted it, but can be very unwieldy for most. Secondly, it runs stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow. I enjoy the clean, simple design which Google has created. Many would rather have the feature rich skins which non-Nexus devices ship with. Other than these possible set backs, the Nexus 6 is a great flagship device. It contains all of the top specs expected on a new phone. The build quality was quite premium and the AMOLED screen is a joy to use. Since the price has been dropping recently, this is an exceptional buy. If you enjoy stock Android and ridiculous screen size, this is the phone for you.
