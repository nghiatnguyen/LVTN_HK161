I am very pleased with the phone we received.  It is a genuine Samsung S3.  I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes.  No problems at all.  It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system.  The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away. I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller).  However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller.  This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received.
The Samsung Galaxy S3 is one of the best phones I've ever used. I absolutely love the phone and the photo quality it has.
I've had my 8100 for about two years.  Dropped it on pavement, concrete, wood floors, etc. at least 30 times so it has a ton of scratches but it's held up very well.  My 2-year old has chewed on it, licked it, smacked it, etc. -- still no problems.  Signal has been solid, intuitive usability is very good.  My standard battery was great for the first 20 months (several hours of talk time, a week of standby) and just now is needing a charge every other day. I'll definitely buy a Sanyo again.
I have had the Sanyo 8100 phone from Sprint for about 14 months.  After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part. I have not dropped the phone or done anything else to warrant all the damage.  The hinge to flip open the phone has completely broken -first just one side broke and pretty soon the entire thing broke.  Then just yesterday the display completely stopped working as well.  According to Sprint, I am not eligible for a new phone for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get a new phone that will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think this phone is the worst purchase I have ever made in my adult life. From day one I had problems with reception, with the volume and with a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message. It only got worse over time. The display is essentially impossible to read in sunlight or even interior light brighter than a 60-watt bulb. The photos are awful. I've had the phone barely a year and it has essentially stopped working now. It'll be a cold day in hell before I give Sony Ericsson any more of my money.
This phone is an excellent phone.  It has a very good color screen, it is well designed, the camera is pretty good for a phone, and it has numerous features.  For example, if you have a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC with an IR sensor, you can transfer phone numbers, to-do items, and more.  You can also record sound, apply themes to you background, and surf the web.  The phone has a very nicely laid out case and menu that is easy to navigate.  It also has a very quality feel when you hold it in your hand.  The only very minor problem with this phone is that the case smudges easily.  Sony includes a nice cloth to wipe it down with.  Besides that, this phone is incredible.  I got two of them under a family plan with ATT and have not been disappointed.  The price is ok, so I would give this phone a 5 out of 5.
The phone looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about it is the ease of use. I do not have the time to tinker with a gadget for an hour to find out how a particular thing works. With this phone, it is really easy to browse through the menu and find out what I am looking for. The PDA feature is also great. If you use your PDA strictly for business purposes, now you can easily do without it as the phone keeps track of all your appointments and phonebook just fine. The Bluetooth headset I installed also works fine and if the device is on any call is transferred to the headset automatically. Overall, the phone is a good purchase but I am a little skeptical about AT&T service. From what I have seen, the coverage seems pretty limited (and if you call the customer service for any reason, expect to be on hold for a long time - about 10-20 minutes).
Previous to purchasing the E105 I was an S105 owner.  I loved that phone but I had my pet peeves about it, the keys being connected on the keypad made it difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving this wasn't really an issue.  Yes it was hard to see the screen in daylight but I don't expect to see a crystal clear picture on a cell phone, they aren't mini laptops folks.  Although it was hard to read, it wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately I went to a concert and lost that phone and replaced it with the E105.  I have no complaints, I live in a basement apartment and the S105 wouldn't get service, but the E105 gets one bar and picks up all my calls crystal clear.  I can hear the caller on the other line perfectly, my boyfriend has one as well and I can hear the whole conversation if I am sitting next to him in a room with mild background noise.  I haven't had any problems with the screen going black, only when the phone goes idle but you can change that option from the menu.  Overall I am pleased with this phone up to date, we'll see if it holds up.
I first fell in love with this phone because it was compact and lightweight.  That's about all I love about the phone right now.  It has really bad reception, not to mention weird background noises on both incoming/outgoing calls.  T-Mobile sent a replacement after I told them of the problem, but it's still the same.  I would buy another phone right now if I had the money.  The wallpapers provided are not the best, and neither are the ringtones.  Sometimes there is a delay for the screen to show up when you flip for opening the phone. The phone is a nice organizer though.  Alarms are loud as well as the ringtones.  Screen is pretty bright.  Buttons are nice and crisp.  That's about all the good features of the phone.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone.
I've had the E105 for about 2 weeks now and I must say it's one of the best phones I've owned.  The included ringers are truly embarrassing to play in public, but it's easy to download new and free ringtones with the free WAP access that T-Mobile includes. The rings are very loud though, and the sound quality is superb... my ringer is currently a song with the voice and all! The sound quality is great, but I guess that depends on your location and service in your area.  T-Mobile includes free basic WAP browsing which I use every day on this phone, and for the people who can't access their favorites in T-Zones... all you have to do is hold down the pound button and your favorites will pop up. The battery life is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making a call, playing games, or browsing the web.  Overall this is an excellent phone, the people who complain about this phone really need to do their research before they blab, I downloaded new games, backgrounds, and ringtones for FREE.
I just received my E105 the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed.  It is much smaller than it looks in the pics and has steel casing.  I was always worried about dropping a flip phone and doing extensive damage.... nothing to worry about with this baby.  The 65,000 color LCD is bright and clear!  There aren't the best song selections for ringtones, but the polyphonic sound is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for a phone with good reception, a stylish look, and a colorful screen, this is the one for you. It doesn't have tons of features like some of the other Samsung models, but who uses all that crap anyway.  I'm very satisfied!
This is a great phone, I used it with my Cingular sim and had no problem with it. I switched to a prepaid plan and it works great. The camera is better than some phones I have seen. The 64MB memory stick is good for pics and music. The bad is you can't get it from any carrier in the states, only online.
After my Motorola V180 had acted up on me and frozen all the damn time, I had to get a new one and the Samsung X495 doesn't disappoint. The only bad thing about this phone is that I can't access the internet. Reception is great, and the battery life is long - it charges in two hours which is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have excellent reception. The speaker phone is superb, not loud, it is so clear, but you have to use it with the phone open. It is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. It's the perfect girl phone. If you are looking for a basic phone that actually works, this is the phone you have been waiting for!
I got this phone because the price was great, and it was easy to hold in my hand. This is my first cellphone, and I love it! I'd recommend it to anyone! A must-have for everyone who is getting their first cellphone. Easy to use, but you have to read the instruction manual first to learn about all of its features. Nice and bright screen with a nice loud ringtone (that is, if you want to put it the max volume). I hope you choose this phone if you're unsure of which Verizon Wireless cell phone to buy.
I am totally in love with this phone. This is the first phone that I could use without worrying if the signal is going to drop. It is so much more reliable and lighter than Z500. You plus it when you change faceplates, you don't have to worry about all the dust and faceplate slipping off. Sure it has a very sensitive camera button but I find it entertaining to see what pictures I have taken by accident. That's just me but oh well. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
I really like this phone.  It's cute, it's little, it's perfect for a young woman.  I had a Pocket PC prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't a mp3 player (i have an iPod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a PDA (i have a PALM TX) … it's just simple and cute. It's Bluetooth compatible... although doesn't work that great with my Bluetooth, but I'm not sure if it's the headset or the phone. The ringer on it is super quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrating feature instead. I like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list. I can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and it's comfortable. Sound quality is good, on both ends I dig it.  I'm sure you will too.
Ok, I have had Verizon for less than two years and this is my third phone.  It is fairly new so I have no complaints as of yet.  The reception is a lot clearer than the last one I had.  The fact that it has a camera is even greater.  I love taking pictures so this was perfect for me.  The picture quality isn't the best, but for a camera phone it is pretty good compared to the others I have seen. The buttons of the phone are larger than some so I don't have trouble hitting the wrong buttons.  I haven't had any difficulty with the battery at all, in fact the battery seems to last quite a bit longer than the last two phones I had.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with this phone.
I got my phone a few days ago and it is way better than the other one I had.  I do have to say that the features are awesome!  They are easier to use than my old phone. The camera is easy as pie to use.  It has a lot of memory. On the screen you can put pictures that you take with the camera option. Or you can download wallpapers for your background.  It is such a nice phone. You can store a lot of contacts in the contacts list. Basically I would recommend this phone for anyone.
I upgraded my phone two months ago from a Motorola V300 to this model because I wanted a radio and a larger keypad. After one month, the radio no longer worked, the battery dies when it claims to be fully charged, it takes three tries to get it to connect when making a call, and sometimes the phone just freaks out and resets itself while you're in the middle of texting or surfing the web. It's flimsy. I've had my V300 for two years and everything still works on it. The Nokia 6101 has a lot of issues.
I have owned the Nokia 6101 since late October 2005. I absolutely love it! I wouldn't trade it for the world. My boyfriend even wanted me to trade it tom get a Motorola Razr V3 like he has, which does have its own set of great perks, but I love my phone. There are a few games on there (with room to download), the camera quality has great clarity, the FM radio works perfectly (and is a great passer of time), and it has great reception on T-Mobile's GSM network. You can also use the recorder to record your own ringtones. It's great!
I recently purchased this phone and it is so much better than the last one I had! The only problem I've had so far is that it froze up once which can be fixed only by putting the battery back in.
This phone is awesome and has great features! I have had it for a year and it hasn't given me a problem once! The ringtones are awesome! The camera quality is great and it has cool games that are fun that you can order. This phone really lets you show your style with features that let you pick your phone colors and online shopping for ringtones and wallpaper! It lets you adjust the phone volume and ringtone volume to your liking and the T-zones online shop has all the best artists and songs that gets everyone dancing, like Rihanna, Chamillionare and a lot more! So, if you want a reliable phone that lets you personalize and just be you, with so many cheap plans to choose from, then you should get the Nokia 6101 Phone (which is T-Mobile of course!) because it's the best!
This phone is excellent.  The best I've had as far as reliability and signal - may be partly because of Cingular, too.  The buttons are a little hard to get used to, but it doesn't take long.  The screen is clear and easy to read, the battery stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use it to call anyone), and it's just an overall good phone.  I totally recommend it.
I've owned a 6101 for 2 years and never had a problem even dropped it once or twice and still worked great. The only reason I'll purchase another is because they will not withstand a 250lbs person accidentally falling on it other than that I enjoyed the phone.
My Nokia 3220 phone is a huge letdown in functionality.  First, I bought it for the camera.  The camera does not allow me to send pictures.  Or my settings, that came with the phone are not sufficient.  This is one of the best reasons to have a camera phone. The 2nd unique feature that I was so excited about was the FM radio function.  My phone does not have that capability either.  Even after sending one back and receiving a brand new phone (exact model as first), no FM function.  Now I don't have options but to contact Nokia direct, which I don't think I should have to do with a brand new phone.  So I am not impressed with this model and do not recommend it.  I was a huge Nokia fan until this phone.
I have owned the phone for about 6 months now.  I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and receive about 20 emails a day.  The phone has a bunch of great capabilities and is occasionally a great work companion.  The wide screen is excellent for viewing.  The CPU functions work a little slow which could be expected from such a small package.  The frustrating part is the phone frequently works slow as well.  About once a week it is necessary to take out the battery and let it sit for a minute before turning the phone on.  The phone takes a couple minutes to turn on.  Overall, it seems slow and unstable which overshadows all of its great features.  Reminds me of Windows 98.
My LG C1300 is a really small, clamshell phone with a part that looks like a mirror on top. It includes most basic features including text messaging, multimedia messaging, media mall, and everything you need to download wallpaper, games, ringtones, and applications straight from Cingular. It has an awesome battery life, but you can't always trust the battery monitor... sometimes it will display one bar left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call quality has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have bad reception... but that is the network, not the phone. Overall, I love my LG C1300 although now I wish I might have had a camera phone, but this phone is awesome for all the features and the minimal price involved.
This was my first cell phone in a few years, my first was the Bulky bag phones. I now own a Sony Ericsson Z500a and have had good luck so far despite the horrible reviews. As for this phone, I liked the design and ease of use much better than my new one. I even dropped it in the toilet and after a week of dry out worked fine. The only thing I realize now is that the signal strength wasn't that great. My wife and I both had these phones and now she has a Nokia 6010 and both of our new phones have better signal strength and clearer call reception than the LG did. But I absolutely loved how the LG 1300 phone was set up more than either of our new ones.
The RAZR is a very durable and reliable phone.  Contrary to other reviews, I have dropped my phone several times and it keeps on ticking!  My wife has the pink RAZR and I have the black RAZR and both of us are extremely pleased.  This is by far the best phone on the market.  It separates itself from all the other plastic and cheap phones.
Have tried lots of phones and the RAZR is the best I've had. Not only for the color, but also the slim profile allows me to put it in my back pocket and never miss a call like I did when my old Bulky phone was in my purse. Sound quality is better than my last Nokia 6600, on both the receiving and talking end. People say they can hear me better now. Highly recommend for function and style. No downsides to this phone that I can see yet, as of 2 months of use.
Had the Motorola Razor and it got damaged so I decided to try this PEBL. With the Razor you can use a Bluetooth ear piece and just push one button and say only the name of who you are calling. This feature I use all the time due to my hands being dirty at work. With this stupid PEBL you have to say all this junk like name dial or digit dial then finally the person’s name. All these extra voice commands are not cool. The PEBL does not ever recognize what you are saying through your compatible earpiece and if it does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped this phone only one time from out of a faulty case on my waist! It sure dents and scratches easy! I will not be using Motorolas anymore, I think they are bad for me.
I bought the L7 SLVR last month from Amazon and it came in as advertise.  This phone is not bad.  Looks real smooth in black, easy to use and its sound is really clear.  The battery life is not bad as well.  I haven't charged it in 3 days with moderate usage and it still has one bar up.  One thing I would suggest is buying a case for it because it's easy to smudge fingerprints on the screen.  So far the phone is fine.  If you're looking for a basic phone with so-so bells and whistles, this would not be a bad choice.
I ordered Nokia 5800 from Bigtime Wireless and it came fast all the way to Nepal and the phone works great. The Nokia 5800 has great features and I highly recommend the phone and the seller. I am buying another one soon from Bigtime Wireless.
Okay. The actual phone is awesome. I love all the features, it's small, it's pretty. The phone is good. The service sucks. When I bought the phone, it said service is available in my area. Not so. I have walked all over this town and cannot send or receive calls and texts ANYWHERE. I have been wrestling for customer service for days now. Unless you live in a huge city with a lot of cell phone towers, do not get this phone. It won't work for you.
We purchased A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone for a trip to Turkey and Greece. The phone did not work in Turkey but it did in Greece, so I believe it was the service and not the phone. My complaint is the camera. After documenting our trip with the camera, we now find we unable to download the pictures without purchasing, at additional cost, software and USB cable from Motorola. Ridiculous!
I've had this phone for 2 years. I've dropped it several times and it still works. It's sturdy. The design is awesome. I like how small it is. They don't make small phones like this anymore. I wish they still made this phone. I would buy another. After a couple years, I find I need to replace the battery or I may upgrade to something else. Otherwise, this phone has been with me for a long time and still works!
I had low expectations about this phone, but when I opened it for the first time I knew it was tend to be mine. I could not want any other phone than this one. It has all the features I want and its very cool, modern and at a very good price.
I ordered the phone last week, and it came this morning. I was very happy for the fast delivery. However, when I opened the box, it looked really cheap to me. The phone was in an old package. Even the phone looked old, and there're scratches on it. Inside the package, there're only a phone, a battery, a back cover, a charger and an old Cingular manual. The phone looked like a refurbished one because the tiny screws on the back was loose. I had to use the screwdriver to fix them. It cost $145 plus tax last week, and it dropped down to $139 plus tax this week. So I already got $6 lost!
The Nokia 2610 is a great basic phone. If you need a phone that is easy to use, this is the one for you. Call quality and reception are great. The phone is straight forward and very user friendly.
The phone is gorgeous, and the buttons are easy to type on. The only downside of this device is the Windows software. It sort of reminds me of Windows 1998 - limited error messages and a very buggy version of Internet Explorer.
