I am very pleased with <0,0,0 the phone> we received.  <1,0,0 It> is <2,0,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <3,0,0 this> for <4,0,0 my wife>, she took <5,0,0 it> to <6,0,0 the ATT store> where <7,0,0 they> plugged in <8,0,0 a sim card> and set <9,0,0 it> up within 5 minutes.  <10,0,0 No problems> at all.  <11,0,0 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <12,0,0 our tile floor>. I even like <13,0,0 some> of <14,0,0 the displays> better than <15,0,0 my S4> <16,0,0 which> is probably associated with <17,0,0 the S3 operating system>.  <18,0,0 The price> was in <19,0,0 line> with <20,0,0 other sellers>. <21,0,0 Breed> shipped <22,0,0 the phone> right away. I had read a number of <23,0,0 reviews> on <24,0,0 this product> advertised elsewhere on <25,0,0 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <26,0,0 a clone> or refurbished <27,0,0 phone> as described by <28,0,0 some other buyers (>even from <29,0,0 the same seller)>.  However, I think that <30,0,0 reviews> may get bundled under <31,0,0 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure <32,0,0 what> is being advertised for <33,0,0 sale> by <34,0,0 the specific seller>.  <35,0,0 This ad> was for <36,0,0 a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone> and <37,0,0 that> is exactly <38,0,0 what> we received.
<0,0,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,0 one> of <2,0,0 the best phones> I've ever used. I absolutely love <3,0,0 the phone> and <4,0,0 the photo quality> <5,0,0 it> has.
I've had <0,0,0 my N8100> for <1,0,0 about two years>.  Dropped <2,0,0 it> on <3,0,0 pavement>, <4,0,0 concrete>, <5,0,0 wood floors>, etc. <6,0,0 at least 30 times> so <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 a ton> of <9,0,0 scratches> but <10,0,0 it>'s held up very well.  <11,0,0 My 2-year old> has chewed on <12,0,0 it>, licked <13,0,0 it>, smacked <14,0,0 it>, <15,0,0 etc.> -- still <16,0,0 no problems>.  <17,0,0 Signal> has been solid, <18,0,0 intuitive usability> is very good.  <19,0,0 My standard battery> was great for <20,0,0 the first 20 months> (several hours of <21,0,0 talk time>, a week of <22,0,0 standby)> and just now is needing <23,0,0 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <24,0,0 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,0,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <1,0,0 Sprint> for <2,0,0 about 14 months>.  After <3,0,0 my phone> got to be <4,0,0 about a year> old, <5,0,0 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <6,0,0 much care> on <7,0,0 my part>. I have not dropped <8,0,0 the phone> or done <9,0,0 anything> else to warrant <10,0,0 all the damage>.  <11,0,0 The hinge> to flip open <12,0,0 the phone> has completely broken, <13,0,0 first just one side> broke and pretty soon <14,0,0 the entire thing> broke.  Then just <15,0,0 yesterday> <16,0,0 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <17,0,0 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <18,0,0 a new phone> for <19,0,0 another 3-4 months> so now I am going to be forced to spend <20,0,0 about $200> just to get <21,0,0 a new phone> <22,0,0 that> will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <23,0,0 This> is <24,0,0 the first phone> I've had <25,0,0 that> has been so cheaply made.
I know <0,0,0 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,0,0 this phone> is <2,0,0 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <3,0,0 my adult life>. From day <4,0,0 one> I had <5,0,0 problems> with <6,0,0 reception>, with <7,0,0 the volume> and with <8,0,0 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <9,0,0 It> only got worse over time. <10,0,0 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <11,0,0 sunlight or even interior light> brighter than <12,0,0 a 60-watt bulb>. <13,0,0 The photos> are awful. I've had <14,0,0 the phone> barely a year and <15,0,0 it> has essentially stopped working now. <16,0,0 It>'ll be a cold day in <17,0,0 hell> before I give <18,0,0 Sony Ericsson> <19,0,0 any more> of <20,0,0 my money>.
<0,0,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 an excellent phone>.  <2,0,0 It> has <3,0,0 a very good color screen>, <4,0,0 it> is well designed, <5,0,0 the camera> is pretty good for <6,0,0 a phone>, and <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 numerous features>.  For <9,0,0 example>, if you have <10,0,0 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <11,0,0 an IR sensor>, you can transfer <12,0,0 phone numbers>, <13,0,0 to-do items>, and <14,0,0 more>.  You can also record <15,0,0 sound>, apply <16,0,0 themes> to <17,0,0 your background>, and <18,0,0 surf> <19,0,0 the web>.  <20,0,0 The phone> has <21,0,0 a> very nicely laid out <22,0,0 case> and <23,0,0 menu> <24,0,0 that> is easy to navigate.  <25,0,0 It> also has <26,0,0 a very quality feel> when you hold <27,0,0 it> in <28,0,0 your hand>.  <29,0,0 The only very minor problem> with <30,0,0 this phone> is that <31,0,0 the case> smudges easily.  <32,0,0 Sony> includes <33,0,0 a nice cloth> to wipe <34,0,0 it> down with.  Besides <35,0,0 that>, <36,0,0 this phone> is incredible.  I got <37,0,0 two> of <38,0,0 them> under <39,0,0 a family plan> with <40,0,0 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <41,0,0 The price> is ok, so I would give <42,0,0 this phone> <43,0,0 a 5> out of <44,0,0 5>.
<0,0,0 The phone> looks amazing, and works even better. <1,0,0 What> I like most about <2,0,0 it> is <3,0,0 the ease> of <4,0,0 use>. I do not have the time to tinker with <5,0,0 a gadget> for an hour to find out how <6,0,0 a particular thing works>. With <7,0,0 this phone>, <8,0,0 it> is really easy to browse through <9,0,0 the menu> and find out <10,0,0 what> I am looking for. <11,0,0 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <12,0,0 your PDA> strictly for <13,0,0 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <14,0,0 it> as <15,0,0 the phone> keeps <16,0,0 track> of <17,0,0 all your appointments and phonebook> just fine. <18,0,0 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also works fine and if <19,0,0 the device> is on, <20,0,0 any call> is transferred to <21,0,0 the headset> automatically. Overall, <22,0,0 the phone> is <23,0,0 a good purchase> but I am a little skeptical about <24,0,0 AT&T service>. From <25,0,0 what> I have seen, <26,0,0 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <27,0,0 the customer service> for <28,0,0 any reason>, expect to be on <29,0,0 hold> for a long time - <30,0,0 about 10-20 minutes)>.
Previous to purchasing <0,0,0 the E105> I was <1,0,0 an S105 owner>.  I loved <2,0,0 that phone>, but I had <3,0,0 my pet> peeves about <4,0,0 it>, <5,0,0 the keys> being connected on <6,0,0 the keypad> made <7,0,0 it> difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving <8,0,0 this> wasn't really <9,0,0 an issue>.  Yes <10,0,0 it> was hard to see <11,0,0 the screen> in <12,0,0 daylight> but I don't expect to see <13,0,0 a crystal clear picture> on <14,0,0 a cell phone>, <15,0,0 they> aren't <16,0,0 mini laptops folks>.  Although <17,0,0 it> was hard to read, <18,0,0 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately, I went to <19,0,0 a concert> and lost that <20,0,0 phone> and replaced <21,0,0 it> with <22,0,0 the E105>.  I have <23,0,0 no complaints>, I live in <24,0,0 a basement apartment> and <25,0,0 the S105> wouldn't get <26,0,0 service>, but <27,0,0 the E105> gets <28,0,0 one bar> and picks up <29,0,0 all my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <30,0,0 the caller> on <31,0,0 the other line> perfectly, <32,0,0 my boyfriend> has <33,0,0 one> as well and I can hear <34,0,0 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <35,0,0 a room> with <36,0,0 mild background noise>.  I haven't had <37,0,0 any problems> with <38,0,0 the screen> going black, only when <39,0,0 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <40,0,0 option> from <41,0,0 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <42,0,0 this phone> up to <43,0,0 date>, we'll see if <44,0,0 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,0 love> with <1,0,0 this phone> because <2,0,0 it> was compact and lightweight.  <3,0,0 That>'s about <4,0,0 all> I love about <5,0,0 the phone> right now.  <6,0,0 It> has really <7,0,0 bad reception>, not to mention <8,0,0 weird background noises> on <9,0,0 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,0,0 T-Mobile> sent <11,0,0 a replacement> after I told <12,0,0 them> of <13,0,0 the problem>, but <14,0,0 it>'s still <15,0,0 the same>.  I would buy <16,0,0 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,0 the money>.  <18,0,0 The wallpapers> provided are not <19,0,0 the best>, and <20,0,0 neither> are <21,0,0 the ringtones>.  Sometimes there is <22,0,0 a delay> for <23,0,0 the screen> to show up when you flip for opening <24,0,0 the phone>. <25,0,0 The phone> is <26,0,0 a nice organizer> though.  <27,0,0 Alarms> are loud as well as <28,0,0 the ringtones>.  <29,0,0 Screen> is pretty bright.  <30,0,0 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <31,0,0 That>'s about <32,0,0 all the good features> of <33,0,0 the phone>.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy <34,0,0 this phone>.
I've had <0,0,0 the E105> for <1,0,0 about 2 weeks> now and I must say <2,0,0 it>'s <3,0,0 one> of <4,0,0 the best phones> I've owned.  <5,0,0 The included ringers> are truly embarrassing to play in public, but <6,0,0 it>'s easy to download <7,0,0 new and free ringtones> with <8,0,0 the free WAP access> <9,0,0 that> <10,0,0 T-Mobile> includes. <11,0,0 The rings> are very loud though, and <12,0,0 the sound quality> is superb... <13,0,0 my ringer> is currently <14,0,0 a song> with <15,0,0 the voice> and <16,0,0 all>! <17,0,0 The sound quality> is great, but I guess <18,0,0 that> depends on <19,0,0 your location and service> in <20,0,0 your area>.  <21,0,0 T-Mobile> includes <22,0,0 free basic WAP> browsing <23,0,0 which> I use every day on <24,0,0 this phone>, and for the people <25,0,0 who> can't access <26,0,0 their favorites> in <27,0,0 T-Zones>... <28,0,0 all> you have to do is hold down <29,0,0 the pound button> and <30,0,0 your favorites> will pop up. <31,0,0 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <32,0,0 a call>, playing <33,0,0 games>, or browsing <34,0,0 the web>.  Overall <35,0,0 this> is <36,0,0 an excellent phone>. The people <37,0,0 who> complain about <38,0,0 this phone> really need to do <39,0,0 their research> before <40,0,0 they> blab. I downloaded <41,0,0 new games>, <42,0,0 backgrounds>, and <43,0,0 ringtones> for free.
I just received <0,0,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm <1,0,0 more> than impressed.  <2,0,0 It> is much smaller than <3,0,0 it> looks in <4,0,0 the pics> and has <5,0,0 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <6,0,0 a flip phone> and doing <7,0,0 extensive damage>.... <8,0,0 nothing> to worry about with <9,0,0 this baby>.  <10,0,0 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  There aren't <11,0,0 the best song selections> for <12,0,0 ringtones>, but <13,0,0 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <14,0,0 a phone> with <15,0,0 good reception>, <16,0,0 a stylish look>, and <17,0,0 a colorful screen>, <18,0,0 this> is <19,0,0 the one> for you. <20,0,0 It> doesn't have <21,0,0 tons> of <22,0,0 features> like <23,0,0 some> of <24,0,0 the other Samsung models>, but <25,0,0 who> uses <26,0,0 all that crap> anyway.  I'm very satisfied!
<0,0,0 This> is <1,0,0 a great phone>, I used <2,0,0 it> with <3,0,0 my Cingular sim> and had <4,0,0 no problem> with <5,0,0 it>. I switched to <6,0,0 a prepaid plan> and <7,0,0 it> works great. <8,0,0 The camera> is better than <9,0,0 some phones> I have seen. <10,0,0 The 64MB memory stick> is good for <11,0,0 pics> and <12,0,0 music>. <13,0,0 The bad> is you can't get <14,0,0 it> from <15,0,0 any carrier> in <16,0,0 the states>, <17,0,0 only online>.
After <0,0,0 my Motorola V180> had acted up on me and frozen <1,0,0 all the damn time>, I had to get <2,0,0 a new one> and <3,0,0 the Samsung X495> doesn't disappoint. <4,0,0 The only bad thing> about <5,0,0 this phone> is that I can't access <6,0,0 the internet>. <7,0,0 Reception> is great, and <8,0,0 the battery life> is long - <9,0,0 it> charges in two hours <10,0,0 which> is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have <11,0,0 excellent reception>. <12,0,0 The speaker phone> is superb, not loud, <13,0,0 it> is so clear, but you have to use <14,0,0 it> with <15,0,0 the phone> open. <16,0,0 It> is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. <17,0,0 It>'s <18,0,0 the perfect girl phone>. If you are looking for <19,0,0 a basic phone> <20,0,0 that> actually works, <21,0,0 this> is <22,0,0 the phone> you have been waiting for!
I got <0,0,0 this phone> because <1,0,0 the price> was great, and <2,0,0 it> was easy to hold in <3,0,0 my hand>. <4,0,0 This> is <5,0,0 my first cellphone>, and I love <6,0,0 it>! I'd recommend <7,0,0 it> to anyone! <8,0,0 A must-have> for everyone <9,0,0 who> is getting <10,0,0 their first cellphone>. <11,0,0 Easy> to use, but you have to read <12,0,0 the instruction manual> first to learn about <13,0,0 all> of <14,0,0 its features>. <15,0,0 Nice and bright screen> with <16,0,0 a nice loud ringtone (<17,0,0 >that> is, if you want to put <18,0,0 it> <19,0,0 the max volume)>. I hope you choose <20,0,0 this phone> if you're unsure of <21,0,0 which> <22,0,0 Verizon Wireless cell phone> to buy.
I am totally in <0,0,0 love> with <1,0,0 this phone>. <2,0,0 This> is <3,0,0 the first phone> <4,0,0 that> I could use without worrying if <5,0,0 the signal> is going to drop. <6,0,0 It> is so much more reliable and lighter than <7,0,0 Z500>. You plus <8,0,0 it> when you change <9,0,0 faceplates>, you don't have to worry about <10,0,0 all the dust and faceplate> slipping off. Sure <11,0,0 it> has <12,0,0 a very sensitive camera button> but I find <13,0,0 it> entertaining to see <14,0,0 what pictures> I have taken by <15,0,0 accident>. <16,0,0 That>'s just me but oh well. You can't have <17,0,0 your cake> and eat <18,0,0 it> too.
I really like <0,0,0 this phone>.  <1,0,0 It>'s cute, <2,0,0 it>'s little, <3,0,0 it>'s perfect for <4,0,0 a young woman>.  I had <5,0,0 a Pocket PC> prior to <6,0,0 this> and <7,0,0 it> was so complicated just making <8,0,0 a call>.  I wanted <9,0,0 something> simple, <10,0,0 that> wasn't <11,0,0 a mp3 player (i> have <12,0,0 an iPod)>, <13,0,0 that> wasn't <14,0,0 a professional camera (i> have <15,0,0 a nice digital cam)>, or <16,0,0 a PDA (i> have <17,0,0 a PALM TX)> … <18,0,0 it>'s just simple and cute. <19,0,0 It>'s Bluetooth compatible... <20,0,0 although> doesn't work <21,0,0 that great> with <22,0,0 my Bluetooth>, but I'm not sure if <23,0,0 it>'s <24,0,0 the headset> or <25,0,0 the phone>. <26,0,0 The ringer> on <27,0,0 it> is <28,0,0 super quiet>... almost to <29,0,0 the point> you can barely hear <30,0,0 it> in <31,0,0 your purse>.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for <32,0,0 the vibrating feature> instead. I like how you can put <33,0,0 a person><34,0,0 's picture> next to <35,0,0 their name> in <36,0,0 your contact list>. I can wear <37,0,0 it> in <38,0,0 the back pocket> of <39,0,0 my jeans> and <40,0,0 it>'s comfortable. <41,0,0 Sound quality> is good, on <42,0,0 both ends> I dig <43,0,0 it>.  I'm sure you will too.
<0,0,0 Ok>, I have had <1,0,0 Verizon> for <2,0,0 less than two years> and <3,0,0 this> is <4,0,0 my third phone>.  <5,0,0 It> is fairly new so I have <6,0,0 no complaints> as of yet.  <7,0,0 The reception> is a lot clearer than <8,0,0 the last one> I had.  <9,0,0 The fact> that <10,0,0 it> has <11,0,0 a camera> is even greater.  I love taking <12,0,0 pictures> so <13,0,0 this> was perfect for me.  <14,0,0 The picture quality> isn't <15,0,0 the best>, but for <16,0,0 a camera phone> <17,0,0 it> is pretty good compared to <18,0,0 the others> I have seen. <19,0,0 The buttons> of <20,0,0 the phone> are larger than <21,0,0 some> so I don't have <22,0,0 trouble> hitting <23,0,0 the wrong buttons>.  I haven't had <24,0,0 any difficulty> with <25,0,0 the battery> at all, in <26,0,0 fact> <27,0,0 the battery> seems to <28,0,0 last quite a> bit longer than <29,0,0 the last two phones> I had.  I am looking forward to <30,0,0 the next 2 years> with <31,0,0 this phone>.
I got <0,0,0 my phone> a few days ago and <1,0,0 it> is way better than <2,0,0 the other one> I had.  I do have to say that <3,0,0 the features> are awesome!  <4,0,0 They> are easier to use than <5,0,0 my old phone>. <6,0,0 The camera> is easy as <7,0,0 pie> to use.  <8,0,0 It> has a lot of <9,0,0 memory>. On <10,0,0 the screen> you can put <11,0,0 pictures> that you take with <12,0,0 the camera option>. Or you can download <13,0,0 wallpapers> for <14,0,0 your background>.  <15,0,0 It> is <16,0,0 such a nice phone>. You can store a lot of <17,0,0 contacts> in <18,0,0 the contacts list>. Basically I would recommend <19,0,0 this phone> for anyone.
I upgraded <0,0,0 my phone> two months ago from <1,0,0 a Motorola V300> to <2,0,0 this model> because I wanted <3,0,0 a radio> and <4,0,0 a larger keypad>. After one month, <5,0,0 the radio> no longer worked, <6,0,0 the battery> dies when <7,0,0 it> claims to be fully charged, <8,0,0 it> takes <9,0,0 three> tries to get <10,0,0 it> to connect when making <11,0,0 a call>, and sometimes <12,0,0 the phone> <13,0,0 just freaks> out and resets <14,0,0 itself> while you're in <15,0,0 the middle> of <16,0,0 texting> or surfing <17,0,0 the web>. <18,0,0 It>'s flimsy. I've had <19,0,0 my V300> for two years and <20,0,0 everything> still works on <21,0,0 it>. <22,0,0 The Nokia 6101> has a lot of <23,0,0 issues>.
I have owned <0,0,0 the Nokia 6101> since <1,0,0 late October 2005>. I absolutely love <2,0,0 it>! I wouldn't trade <3,0,0 it> for <4,0,0 the world>. <5,0,0 My boyfriend> even wanted me to trade <6,0,0 it> <7,0,0 tom> get <8,0,0 a Motorola Razr V3> like he has, <9,0,0 which> does have <10,0,0 its own set> of <11,0,0 great perks>, but I love <12,0,0 my phone>. There are <13,0,0 a few games> on <14,0,0 there (>with <15,0,0 room> to download<16,0,0 )>, <17,0,0 the camera quality> has <18,0,0 great clarity>, <19,0,0 the FM radio> works perfectly (and is <20,0,0 a great passer> of time), and <21,0,0 it> has <22,0,0 great reception> on <23,0,0 T-Mobile><24,0,0 's GSM network>. You can also use <25,0,0 the recorder> to record <26,0,0 your own ringtones>. <27,0,0 It>'s great!
I recently purchased <0,0,0 this phone> and <1,0,0 it> is so much better than <2,0,0 the last one> I had! <3,0,0 The only problem> I've had so far is that <4,0,0 it> froze up once <5,0,0 which> can be fixed only by putting <6,0,0 the battery> back in.
<0,0,0 This phone> is awesome and has <1,0,0 great features>! I have had <2,0,0 it> for a year and <3,0,0 it> hasn't given me <4,0,0 a problem> once! <5,0,0 The ringtones> are awesome! <6,0,0 The camera quality> is great and <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 cool games> <9,0,0 that> are <10,0,0 fun> that you can order. <11,0,0 This phone> really lets you show <12,0,0 your style> with <13,0,0 features> <14,0,0 that> let you pick <15,0,0 your phone colors> and <16,0,0 online shopping> for <17,0,0 ringtones> and <18,0,0 wallpaper>! <19,0,0 It> lets you adjust <20,0,0 the phone volume> and <21,0,0 ringtone volume> to <22,0,0 your liking> and <23,0,0 the T-zones online shop> has <24,0,0 all the best artists and songs> <25,0,0 that> gets <26,0,0 everyone dancing>, like <27,0,0 Rihanna>, <28,0,0 Chamillionare> and a lot more! So, if you want <29,0,0 a reliable phone> <30,0,0 that> lets you personalize and just be you, with <31,0,0 so many cheap plans> to choose from, then you should get <32,0,0 the Nokia 6101 Phone (which> is <33,0,0 T-Mobile> of <34,0,0 course>!) because it<35,0,0 's> the <36,0,0 best!>
<0,0,0 This phone> is excellent.  <1,0,0 The best> I've had as far as <2,0,0 reliability and signal> - may be partly because of <3,0,0 Cingular>, too.  <4,0,0 The buttons> are a little hard to get used to, but <5,0,0 it> doesn't take long.  <6,0,0 The screen> is clear and easy to read, <7,0,0 the battery> stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use <8,0,0 it> to call anyone), and <9,0,0 it>'s <10,0,0 just an overall good phone>.  I totally recommend <11,0,0 it>.
I've owned <0,0,0 a 6101> for 2 years and never had <1,0,0 a problem> even dropped <2,0,0 it> once or twice and still worked great. <3,0,0 The only reason> I'll purchase <4,0,0 another> is because <5,0,0 they> will not withstand <6,0,0 a 250lbs person> accidentally falling on <7,0,0 it> other than <8,0,0 that> I enjoyed <9,0,0 the phone>.
<0,0,0 My Nokia 3220 phone> is <1,0,0 a huge letdown> in <2,0,0 functionality>.  First, I bought <3,0,0 it> for <4,0,0 the camera>.  <5,0,0 The camera> does not allow me to send <6,0,0 pictures>.  Or <7,0,0 my settings>, <8,0,0 that> came with <9,0,0 the phone> are not sufficient.  <10,0,0 This> is <11,0,0 one> of <12,0,0 the best reasons> to have <13,0,0 a camera phone>. <14,0,0 The 2nd unique feature> <15,0,0 that> I was so excited <16,0,0 about> was <17,0,0 the FM radio function>.  <18,0,0 My phone> does not have <19,0,0 that capability> either.  Even after sending <20,0,0 one> back and receiving <21,0,0 a brand new phone (exact model> as <22,0,0 first)>, <23,0,0 no FM function>.  Now I don't have <24,0,0 options> but to contact <25,0,0 Nokia> direct, <26,0,0 which> I don't think I should have to do with <27,0,0 a brand new phone>.  So I am not impressed with <28,0,0 this model> and do not recommend <29,0,0 it>.  I was <30,0,0 a huge Nokia fan> until <31,0,0 this phone>.
I have owned <0,0,0 the phone> for <1,0,0 about 6 months> now.  I talk <2,0,0 about 3500 minutes> a month, send and receive <3,0,0 about 20 emails> a day.  <4,0,0 The phone> has <5,0,0 a bunch> of <6,0,0 great capabilities> and is occasionally <7,0,0 a great work companion>.  <8,0,0 The wide screen> is excellent for viewing.  <9,0,0 The CPU functions> work a little slow <10,0,0 which> could be expected from <11,0,0 such a small package>.  <12,0,0 The frustrating part> is <13,0,0 the phone> frequently works slow as well.  About once a week <14,0,0 it> is necessary to take out <15,0,0 the battery> and let <16,0,0 it> sit for a minute before turning <17,0,0 the phone> on.  <18,0,0 The phone> takes <19,0,0 a couple minutes> to turn on.  Overall, <20,0,0 it> seems slow and unstable <21,0,0 which> overshadows <22,0,0 all> of <23,0,0 its great features>.  Reminds me of <24,0,0 Windows 98>.
<0,0,0 My LG C1300> is <1,0,0 a really small, clamshell phone> with <2,0,0 a part> <3,0,0 that> looks like <4,0,0 a mirror> on <5,0,0 top>. <6,0,0 It> includes <7,0,0 most basic features> including <8,0,0 text messaging>, <9,0,0 multimedia> messaging, <10,0,0 media mall>, and <11,0,0 everything> you need to download <12,0,0 wallpaper>, <13,0,0 games>, <14,0,0 ringtones>, and <15,0,0 applications> straight from <16,0,0 Cingular>. <17,0,0 It> has <18,0,0 an awesome battery life>, but you can't always trust <19,0,0 the battery monitor>... sometimes <20,0,0 it> will display <21,0,0 one bar> left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call <22,0,0 quality> has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have <23,0,0 bad reception>... but <24,0,0 that> is <25,0,0 the network><26,0,0 , not> <27,0,0 the phone>. Overall, I love <28,0,0 my LG C1300> although now I wish I might have had <29,0,0 a camera phone>, but <30,0,0 this phone> is awesome for <31,0,0 all the features> and <32,0,0 the minimal price> involved.
<0,0,0 This> was <1,0,0 my first cell phone> in a few years, <2,0,0 my first> was <3,0,0 the Bulky bag phones>. I now own <4,0,0 a Sony Ericsson Z500a> and have had <5,0,0 good luck> so far despite <6,0,0 the horrible reviews>. As for <7,0,0 this phone>, I liked <8,0,0 the design and ease> of <9,0,0 use> much better than <10,0,0 my new one>. I even dropped <11,0,0 it> in <12,0,0 the toilet> and after a week of <13,0,0 dry> out <14,0,0 worked fine>. <15,0,0 The only thing> I realize now is that <16,0,0 the signal strength> wasn't that great. <17,0,0 My wife> and I <18,0,0 both> had <19,0,0 these phones> and now she has <20,0,0 a Nokia 6010> and <21,0,0 both> of <22,0,0 our new phones> have <23,0,0 better signal strength> and <24,0,0 clearer call reception> than <25,0,0 the LG> did. But I absolutely loved how <26,0,0 the LG 1300 phone> was set up <27,0,0 more> than <28,0,0 either> of <29,0,0 our new ones>.
<0,0,0 The RAZR> is <1,0,0 a very durable and reliable phone>.  Contrary to <2,0,0 other reviews>, I have dropped <3,0,0 my phone> several times and <4,0,0 it> keeps on ticking!  <5,0,0 My wife> has <6,0,0 the pink RAZR> and I have <7,0,0 the black RAZR> and <8,0,0 both> of us are extremely pleased.  <9,0,0 This> is by <10,0,0 far the best phone> on <11,0,0 the market>.  <12,0,0 It> separates <13,0,0 itself> from <14,0,0 all the other plastic> and <15,0,0 cheap phones>.
Have tried lots of <0,0,0 phones> and <1,0,0 the RAZR> is <2,0,0 the best> I've had. Not only for <3,0,0 the color>, but also <4,0,0 the slim profile> allows me to put <5,0,0 it> in <6,0,0 my back pocket> and never miss <7,0,0 a call> <8,0,0 like> I did when <9,0,0 my old Bulky phone> was in <10,0,0 my purse>. <11,0,0 Sound quality> is better than <12,0,0 my last Nokia 6600>, on <13,0,0 both the receiving and talking end>. People say <14,0,0 they> can hear me better now. Highly recommend for <15,0,0 function and style>. <16,0,0 No downsides> to <17,0,0 this phone> <18,0,0 that> I can see yet, as of 2 months of <19,0,0 use>.
Had <0,0,0 the Motorola Razor> and <1,0,0 it> got damaged so I decided to try <2,0,0 this PEBL>. With <3,0,0 the Razor> you can use <4,0,0 a Bluetooth ear piece> and just push <5,0,0 one button> and say <6,0,0 only the name> of <7,0,0 who> you are calling. <8,0,0 This feature> I use <9,0,0 all the time> due to <10,0,0 my hands> being dirty at <11,0,0 work>. With <12,0,0 this stupid PEBL> you have to say <13,0,0 all this junk> like <14,0,0 name dial or digit dial> then finally <15,0,0 the person><16,0,0 ’s name>. <17,0,0 All these extra voice commands> are not cool. <18,0,0 The PEBL> does not ever recognize <19,0,0 what> you are saying through <20,0,0 your compatible earpiece> and if <21,0,0 it> does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped <22,0,0 this phone> only one time from out of <23,0,0 a faulty case> on <24,0,0 my waist>! <25,0,0 It> sure <26,0,0 dents> and <27,0,0 scratches> easy! I will not be using <28,0,0 Motorolas> anymore, I think <29,0,0 they> are bad for me.
I bought <0,0,0 the L7 SLVR> last month from <1,0,0 Amazon> and <2,0,0 it> came in as advertise.  <3,0,0 This phone> is not bad.  Looks <4,0,0 real smooth> in <5,0,0 black>, easy to use and <6,0,0 its sound> is really clear.  <7,0,0 The battery life> is not bad as well.  I haven't charged <8,0,0 it> in 3 days with <9,0,0 moderate usage> and <10,0,0 it> still has <11,0,0 one bar> up.  <12,0,0 One thing> I would suggest is buying <13,0,0 a case> for <14,0,0 it> because <15,0,0 it>'s easy to smudge <16,0,0 fingerprints> on <17,0,0 the screen>.  So far <18,0,0 the phone> is fine.  If you're looking for <19,0,0 a basic phone> with <20,0,0 so-so bells and whistles>, <21,0,0 this> would not be <22,0,0 a bad choice>.
I ordered <0,0,0 Nokia 5800> from <1,0,0 Bigtime Wireless> and <2,0,0 it> came fast <3,0,0 all the way> to <4,0,0 Nepal> and <5,0,0 the phone> works great. <6,0,0 The Nokia 5800> has <7,0,0 great features> and I highly recommend <8,0,0 the phone> and <9,0,0 the seller>. I am buying <10,0,0 another one> soon from <11,0,0 Bigtime Wireless>.
Okay. <0,0,0 The actual phone> is awesome. I love <1,0,0 all the features>, <2,0,0 it>'s small, <3,0,0 it>'s pretty. <4,0,0 The phone> is good. <5,0,0 The service> sucks. When I bought <6,0,0 the phone>, <7,0,0 it> said <8,0,0 service> is available in <9,0,0 my area>. Not so. I have walked <10,0,0 all> over <11,0,0 this town> and cannot send or receive <12,0,0 calls and texts> ANYWHERE. I have been wrestling for <13,0,0 customer service> for days now. Unless you live in <14,0,0 a huge city> with a lot of <15,0,0 cell phone towers>, do not get <16,0,0 this phone>. <17,0,0 It> won't work for you.
We purchased <0,0,0 A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone> for <1,0,0 a trip> to <2,0,0 Turkey and Greece>. <3,0,0 The phone> did not work in <4,0,0 Turkey> but <5,0,0 it> did in <6,0,0 Greece>, so I believe <7,0,0 it> was <8,0,0 the service and not> <9,0,0 the phone>. <10,0,0 My complaint> is <11,0,0 the camera>. After documenting <12,0,0 our trip> with <13,0,0 the camera>, we now find we unable to download <14,0,0 the pictures> without purchasing, at <15,0,0 additional cost, software and USB cable> from <16,0,0 Motorola>. Ridiculous!
I've had <0,0,0 this phone> for 2 years. I've dropped <1,0,0 it> several times and <2,0,0 it> still works. <3,0,0 It>'s sturdy. <4,0,0 The design> is awesome. I like how small <5,0,0 it> is. <6,0,0 They> don't make <7,0,0 small phones> like <8,0,0 this> anymore. I wish <9,0,0 they> still made <10,0,0 this phone>. I would buy <11,0,0 another>. After <12,0,0 a couple years>, I find I need to replace <13,0,0 the battery> or I may upgrade to <14,0,0 something else>. Otherwise, <15,0,0 this phone> has been with me for a long time and still works!
I had <0,0,0 low expectations> about <1,0,0 this phone>, but when I opened <2,0,0 it> for the first time I knew <3,0,0 it> tends to be mine. I could not want <4,0,0 any other phone> than <5,0,0 this one>. <6,0,0 It> has <7,0,0 all the features> I want and <8,0,0 its very cool, modern> and at <9,0,0 a very good price>.
I ordered <0,0,0 the phone> last week, and <1,0,0 it> came <2,0,0 this morning>. I was very happy for <3,0,0 the fast delivery>. However, when I opened <4,0,0 the box>, <5,0,0 it> looked really cheap to me. <6,0,0 The phone> was in <7,0,0 an old package>. <8,0,0 Even the phone> looked old, and there're <9,0,0 scratches> on <10,0,0 it>. Inside <11,0,0 the package>, there're only <12,0,0 a phone>, <13,0,0 a battery>, <14,0,0 a back cover>, <15,0,0 a charger> and <16,0,0 an old Cingular manual>. <17,0,0 The phone> looked like <18,0,0 a refurbished one> because <19,0,0 the tiny screws> on <20,0,0 the back> was loose. I had to use <21,0,0 the screwdriver> to fix <22,0,0 them>. <23,0,0 It> costs $145 plus <24,0,0 tax> last week, and <25,0,0 it> dropped down to $139 plus <26,0,0 tax> this week. So I already got $6 lost!
<0,0,0 The Nokia 2610> is <1,0,0 a great basic phone>. If you need <2,0,0 a phone> <3,0,0 that> is easy to use, <4,0,0 this> is <5,0,0 the one> for you. Call <6,0,0 quality and reception> are great. <7,0,0 The phone> is straight forward and very user-friendly.
<0,0,0 The phone> is gorgeous, and <1,0,0 the buttons> are easy for <2,0,0 typing> on. <3,0,0 The only downside> of <4,0,0 this device> is <5,0,0 the Windows software>. <6,0,0 It> reminds me of <7,0,0 Windows 1998> - <8,0,0 limited error messages> and <9,0,0 a very buggy version> of <10,0,0 Internet Explorer>.
After having had <0,0,0 this phone> in <1,0,0 18 months or so>, <2,0,0 my final impressions> on <3,0,0 the phone> are: <4,0,0 It>'s <5,0,0 quick, good fast processor>. <6,0,0 Screen> is very good, better than <7,0,0 average outdoor> in <8,0,0 sun>, and shows <9,0,0 nice detail> for <10,0,0 pictures>, <11,0,0 videos> and <12,0,0 the such>. <13,0,0 Phone body> is slippery. <14,0,0 It>'s not <15,0,0 a good phone> to hold in <16,0,0 your hand>. <17,0,0 Battery life> is fair. I never felt <18,0,0 comfortable> leaving home all day without <19,0,0 a charger> handy. To me <20,0,0 this> is <21,0,0 reason> enough that I would not purchase <22,0,0 this phone> again. After nearly 18 months, <23,0,0 battery> is dead. <24,0,0 It> will not recharge. <25,0,0 Only solution> is to get <26,0,0 the phone> to <27,0,0 service> to replace <28,0,0 the battery>. <29,0,0 It> will cost me $200 as I have <30,0,0 phone insurance>. <31,0,0 Lesson> learned: don't ever get <32,0,0 a phone> <33,0,0 which> doesn't have <34,0,0 a rechargeable battery>, ever again.
I've not had <0,0,0 the phone> for <1,0,0 over a week>. <2,0,0 The screen> is fantastic. <3,0,0 My monthly google calendar> shows up on <4,0,0 1 screen>, and <5,0,0 it>'s easy to read <6,0,0 all the events> on <7,0,0 it>. I can actually use <8,0,0 the phone> in <9,0,0 bright sunlight>, <10,0,0 something> I haven't been able to do well with <11,0,0 prior cell phones>. There was <12,0,0 a Samsung push> update <13,0,0 which> appears to have helped <14,0,0 the battery life>, and I for <15,0,0 that reason> have raised <16,0,0 the rating> from <17,0,0 3 to 4 stars>. <18,0,0 The battery> now lasts me all day, with <19,0,0 casual uses>. If you are <20,0,0 a heavy user>, <21,0,0 this phone> will not last you all day without <22,0,0 a re-charge> by 2 PM. <23,0,0 The good news> is that a 10-15 minutes recharge will give you a 30-40% or so battery boost and <24,0,0 the phone> can be >90% in <25,0,0 about one hour>. I still do not recommend <26,0,0 the phone> for <27,0,0 heavy app users (gamers>). You'll need to consider <28,0,0 the Samsung note> or <29,0,0 the Droid phones> as I can't see <30,0,0 the S6> lasting <31,0,0 past 2 PM> for <32,0,0 those individuals>.
<0,0,0 This product> worked for 1 day and then I was using <1,0,0 it> while plugged in to <2,0,0 a charger> and <3,0,0 it> died. <4,0,0 The battery> was at 44% and dropped to 0% and said to plug <5,0,0 it> in to <6,0,0 the charger> even though <7,0,0 it> was plugged in. I tried charging <8,0,0 the phone> with <9,0,0 various chargers> throughout <10,0,0 the rest> of the day but when unplugged <11,0,0 it> would just turn off. <12,0,0 It> did work <13,0,0 fine> while plugged in. <14,0,0 This> is <15,0,0 a great phone> but I will not buy <16,0,0 a phone> from <17,0,0 this seller> again.
I finally upgraded from <0,0,0 the Galaxy S3>, and I really love <1,0,0 this phone>. <2,0,0 The screen> is bigger and much sharper, <3,0,0 the camera> is amazing compared to <4,0,0 the old one>, and <5,0,0 the size/shape> are really slick. <6,0,0 The new size> took <7,0,0 some getting> used to, but I adapted quickly. I'll be getting <8,0,0 a case> asap, so I'm not sure <9,0,0 how much> of <10,0,0 an issue> <11,0,0 that> is at all. <12,0,0 The processing speed> is <13,0,0 SO MUCH FASTER>. <14,0,0 It> doesn't overheat, <15,0,0 it> doesn't freeze up, and I am having <16,0,0 no issues> whatsoever watching movies/TV, listening to <17,0,0 music>, or playing <18,0,0 games>. <19,0,0 The resolution> is very nice and I like <20,0,0 the grouping option> for <21,0,0 the apps> instead of having <22,0,0 them> scattered all over <23,0,0 multiple pages>. However, <24,0,0 the SD> is located in <25,0,0 a tray> <26,0,0 that> requires <27,0,0 a special tool> to open, and I didn't have <28,0,0 one>. I tried <29,0,0 a paperclip> and that didn't work either, then I used <30,0,0 the post back> of <31,0,0 an earring> and <32,0,0 it> finally popped open, but <33,0,0 it> required <34,0,0 a nano sim> , so I still had to go to <35,0,0 the Verizon store> for <36,0,0 a new sim (no charge>, but <37,0,0 a pain> to drive across <38,0,0 town)>. Also, there is <39,0,0 NO SD card slot>. <40,0,0 None>. <41,0,0 Just cloud access> and <42,0,0 the USB port> to transfer <43,0,0 files> from <44,0,0 the computer>. I didn't expect <45,0,0 that> since <46,0,0 the older Galaxys> and <47,0,0 the new 7> had <48,0,0 SD slots>. <49,0,0 Kind> of <50,0,0 an annoyance> and significantly reduces <51,0,0 my overall storage space>.
There are <0,0,0 many things> to like about <1,0,0 the S6>. <2,0,0 The screen> is bright and sharp. <3,0,0 The camera> is <4,0,0 very high quality (>for <5,0,0 a smartphone)>. <6,0,0 The version> I got (delivered with <7,0,0 Verizon service)> has <8,0,0 some apps> I'd call "<9,0,0 trash>", but <10,0,0 nothing> terrible. I got <11,0,0 64GB memory>, and after <12,0,0 one+ year>, <13,0,0 that> seems <14,0,0 fine> for me, allowing <15,0,0 storage> of lots of <16,0,0 pictures>, and <17,0,0 a few videos>; <18,0,0 32GB> would be cramped. <19,0,0 Wireless> charging is <20,0,0 a blessing (and maybe> <21,0,0 a curse>; see below). On <22,0,0 the negative side>, there's <23,0,0 the battery>. <24,0,0 Battery life> leaves <25,0,0 something> to be desired. If you're <26,0,0 a heavy user>, just hope that <27,0,0 a charge> lasts through a log day. Also hope that <28,0,0 your battery> doesn't flat out <29,0,0 die>, as <30,0,0 mine> did after a year and a few months (after <31,0,0 the warranty>, but before <32,0,0 the exchange period)>. Changing <33,0,0 a battery> requires <34,0,0 a professional>, <35,0,0 which> means you're likely to be without <36,0,0 your phone> for <37,0,0 a little while>.
<0,0,0 Great phone> for <1,0,0 a great price>. <2,0,0 This phone> was almost in <3,0,0 a new> like <4,0,0 state> when I bought <5,0,0 it> from <6,0,0 Amazon>. I love <7,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S6>, I have had <8,0,0 the S3> for years now and just upgraded and let me tell you <9,0,0 it> is like <10,0,0 night and day>. <11,0,0 Great phone>, quick at opening <12,0,0 emails> & <13,0,0 such>, <14,0,0 the screen> can be seen outside in <15,0,0 the sun light>. <16,0,0 This phone> is like taking <17,0,0 a small computer> around with you <18,0,0 all the time>. I do wish <19,0,0 the sound> was louder, even with <20,0,0 the ring tone> set at <21,0,0 high level> I still don't hear <22,0,0 it> <23,0,0 all the time> unless I am close by. I would for <24,0,0 sure buy> <25,0,0 this product> again!
<0,0,0 My S4> was <1,0,0 my favorite phone> of all time. When <2,0,0 my contract> was up, <3,0,0 the S6> just came out, so how could I pass on <4,0,0 what> could only be 2x better than <5,0,0 my S4>. I was pretty disappointed. Sure, <6,0,0 it> has <7,0,0 more fancy gadgets>, and <8,0,0 it> is quicker. But <9,0,0 it> also comes with so much less, the number one issue being <10,0,0 battery life>. I have never made <11,0,0 it> through a full day on <12,0,0 one charge>. And I am not talking about watching <13,0,0 Youtube> all day, <14,0,0 it> could be just sitting on <15,0,0 my desk>, and if I haven't plugged <16,0,0 it> in, <17,0,0 it> will be dead by 7:00. As much as we depend on <18,0,0 our phones> these days, <19,0,0 this> is really unacceptable. Hopefully <20,0,0 the S8> will be 4x better than <21,0,0 my S4>.
I love <0,0,0 this phone>. <1,0,0 It>'s fast and does <2,0,0 everything>. <3,0,0 The only thing> is I had to send <4,0,0 my first phone> back when bought from <5,0,0 Verizon> because <6,0,0 the battery> was awful and <7,0,0 it> froze and crashed often. <8,0,0 Verizon> was helpful though and replaced <9,0,0 it> and I had <10,0,0 no problems> with <11,0,0 the new one>. Then I dropped <12,0,0 it> cracked <13,0,0 the front screen> and didn't have <14,0,0 insurance> so I bought <15,0,0 a used one> on <16,0,0 amazon> because <17,0,0 it>’s cheaper and <18,0,0 it> seems to be working just fine.
I've had <0,0,0 a Galaxy S3 and S4> and was very happy with <1,0,0 both> of <2,0,0 them>. <3,0,0 The new S6> has <4,0,0 a terrible battery and mine> is glitchy for <5,0,0 some reason>. I attempted to get <6,0,0 assistance> from <7,0,0 Verizon> but <8,0,0 they> told me <9,0,0 that>'s how <10,0,0 the phone acts>. Needless to say I'm very disappointed and <11,0,0 it> becomes very easy to buy <12,0,0 an iPhone> the next time around.
I upgraded from <0,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S4>. <1,0,0 These> are <2,0,0 the things> I like better about <3,0,0 the S6>: <4,0,0 brighter display>. <5,0,0 Two-part volume button> makes <6,0,0 it> easier to adjust <7,0,0 the volume>. Being able to close <8,0,0 apps> by touching <9,0,0 the icon> to <10,0,0 the left> of <11,0,0 the home button> instead of having to hold down <12,0,0 the home button>. Using <13,0,0 the flashlight> on <14,0,0 the quick settings panel> rather than needing <15,0,0 a separate app>. Being able to scroll down <16,0,0 the settings panel> rather than having to choose from <17,0,0 the different types> of <18,0,0 settings> in <19,0,0 advance>. Even though <20,0,0 the screen> is slightly bigger <21,0,0 the overall size> of <22,0,0 the phone> feels smaller. I use <23,0,0 an Otter Box Defender Series case>, as I did with <24,0,0 the S4>, and <25,0,0 it> definitely is less bulky than before. I have <26,0,0 an armband> for <27,0,0 the phone>. I can put <28,0,0 the entire case> in <29,0,0 the armband> with <30,0,0 the S6> whereas with <31,0,0 the S4> I needed to remove <32,0,0 the outer layer> of <33,0,0 the case>. <34,0,0 The included fast charger> is definitely faster than <35,0,0 the S4 charger>.
I really liked <0,0,0 my Samsung Galaxy S4> but <1,0,0 the S6> is better without changing <2,0,0 things> unnecessarily. I recommend maxing out <3,0,0 the memory> at <4,0,0 128GB> as you can't add <5,0,0 more> later. I hope <6,0,0 the battery> holds up since <7,0,0 it> can't be changed by <8,0,0 the user>. <9,0,0 Voice recognition> works much better on <10,0,0 the S6> than <11,0,0 the S4>. <12,0,0 The operating system> seems much quicker and <13,0,0 less buggy> as well.
I had <0,0,0 this phone> for 1.5 months and there has been <1,0,0 no issues> with <2,0,0 it>. <3,0,0 The phone> is beautiful and <4,0,0 it> fits easily within <5,0,0 the hand>. <6,0,0 It>'s fast and slick and I can play <7,0,0 any current android game> on <8,0,0 it>. I would recommend that you guys buy <9,0,0 this phone> directly from <10,0,0 amazon> despite <11,0,0 the lower prices> from <12,0,0 other sellers> as there has been <13,0,0 reviews> stating that <14,0,0 the other sellers> are selling <15,0,0 used phones>.
I bought <0,0,0 my Galaxy S7 Edge> and paid <1,0,0 full price> for <2,0,0 it> <3,0,0 less than 7 months> ago. Now <4,0,0 the phone> is presenting <5,0,0 a hardware problem> <6,0,0 which> was already acknowledged by <7,0,0 Samsung> that <8,0,0 it> is <9,0,0 a factory problem>, <10,0,0 what means>, <11,0,0 they> know <12,0,0 it> is <13,0,0 their problem> and that <14,0,0 they> are supposed to get <15,0,0 it> fixed or exchanged. However, because <16,0,0 it> is <17,0,0 an "Unlocked International Version>", <18,0,0 no Samsung> authorized <19,0,0 service> would even touch <20,0,0 the phone>. Not even if I am paying for <21,0,0 the service>. So, now I have <22,0,0 a USD 800 paper weight> worth <23,0,0 nothing> at all. I hope <24,0,0 Samsung> is reading <25,0,0 this>. I have been <26,0,0 a Samsung Loyal customer> since <27,0,0 Galaxy S> <28,0,0 II> and now I am dropping <29,0,0 this "Loyalty>" for <30,0,0 a Windows Phone (yeah>, <31,0,0 Windows Phone>. After wasting <32,0,0 my money> with <33,0,0 a "Samsung Flagship>", <34,0,0 a windows Phone> is <35,0,0 all> I could afford to buy). <36,0,0 Thanks Samsung>, you have made <37,0,0 an (ex) customer> really unhappy!
<0,0,0 My boyfriend> got <1,0,0 this phone> over <2,0,0 the summer>, and he actually likes <3,0,0 it> much better than <4,0,0 his former iPhone>. <5,0,0 It> comes with <6,0,0 earbuds>, <7,0,0 a charging cable>, and <8,0,0 a very useful charging adaptor> to accommodate <9,0,0 different charging ports>. I personally think <10,0,0 it>'s too big, but I have <11,0,0 small hands>. Overall, <12,0,0 a very reliable phone> <13,0,0 that> works really well.
I bought <0,0,0 the white version> of <1,0,0 the Samsung S7 edge> and <2,0,0 it> is <3,0,0 an amazing and gorgeous phone>. <4,0,0 It> was really difficult to find <5,0,0 it> because <6,0,0 it>'s not available for the US but <7,0,0 it> totally worth <8,0,0 the trouble>. I got <9,0,0 the Italian edition> of <10,0,0 it> and <11,0,0 it> works nice and smooth with <12,0,0 my Mexican SIM card>, <13,0,0 it> doesn't have <14,0,0 any preloaded content> <15,0,0 which> is great and <16,0,0 the preinstalled apps> are <17,0,0 the same> as <18,0,0 the US version>. <19,0,0 The only issue> might be that <20,0,0 the power connector> of <21,0,0 the charger> is European, but <22,0,0 the seller> solved <23,0,0 it> in <24,0,0 a great way> by including <25,0,0 an American adapter>. I love <26,0,0 my new phone> and <27,0,0 the whole experience> was excellent with <28,0,0 this seller>. I used to be <29,0,0 an iPhone lover>, but <30,0,0 Samsung> did <31,0,0 a great jog> with <32,0,0 this one> and I'm perfectly happy of having taken <33,0,0 the risk>. Totally recommended!
I purchased <0,0,0 this S7 edge> back in March. After two months, <1,0,0 it> started showing <2,0,0 some screen color issues> with <3,0,0 annoying purple stripes> all over <4,0,0 the screen> and <5,0,0 the cellphone> <6,0,0 itself> feels hot. I had to set <7,0,0 the brightness> to <8,0,0 the maximum> to temporarily "avoid" <9,0,0 screen issues>. And <10,0,0 what>'s worse, <11,0,0 the screen> just died completely and I can't even turn off <12,0,0 this phone> since <13,0,0 the screen> is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return <14,0,0 this> failed <15,0,0 S7 edge> and get <16,0,0 my money> back and never want to buy <17,0,0 any Samsung product> again.
I received <0,0,0 this phone> <1,0,0 yesterday> and instantly fell in <2,0,0 love> with <3,0,0 it>. I have owned <4,0,0 several Galaxy phones (S3, S4>, <5,0,0 S4 Active, and S5)>. So far I love <6,0,0 it>! <7,0,0 It> came sealed in <8,0,0 the original box>. I cannot use <9,0,0 the charger adapter> <10,0,0 that> came with <11,0,0 it>, but I expected that as <12,0,0 it>'s <13,0,0 an international version>. I picked <14,0,0 the gold color>, <15,0,0 it> looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love <16,0,0 the interface>, <17,0,0 the phone> <18,0,0 itself> is super fast. <19,0,0 The phone> has <20,0,0 a big, beautifully bright screen>. I am still getting used to <21,0,0 its size>. <22,0,0 The fingerprint scanner> is noticeably better than <23,0,0 that> of <24,0,0 the GS5>. <25,0,0 Both cameras> take <26,0,0 amazing pictures>. I am <27,0,0 one> of <28,0,0 those people> <29,0,0 that> are constantly on <30,0,0 their phones> during <31,0,0 most> of the day. <32,0,0 It> has <33,0,0 an excellent battery life and charges> very fast. I did read <34,0,0 a couple> reviews where people complained about <35,0,0 the phone> slipping out of <36,0,0 their hands>. I have used <37,0,0 an Otterbox Symmetry Series case> since I took <38,0,0 it> out of <39,0,0 the box> and have not had that <40,0,0 problem> at all. <41,0,0 My only complaint> about <42,0,0 this phone> is that <43,0,0 it> does not have <44,0,0 an IR blaster>, but I can live with <45,0,0 that>. I will update <46,0,0 my review> in <47,0,0 the future> if <48,0,0 anything changes>.
<0,0,0 This> is replacing <1,0,0 my Galaxy S4> and lives up to <2,0,0 the hype>. <3,0,0 No problems> transferring <4,0,0 phones> with <5,0,0 Consumer Cellular>, I merely took <6,0,0 the sim card> from <7,0,0 my S4> and put <8,0,0 it> into <9,0,0 the S7> and I was ready to go, <10,0,0 no hassle>. <11,0,0 Battery life> seems to be much better than <12,0,0 the S4> plus I like <13,0,0 the fingerprint log> in although sometimes <14,0,0 it> won't recognize <15,0,0 it> making <16,0,0 it> frustrating. I end up having to use <17,0,0 the draw pattern>. Overall <18,0,0 a nice phone>.
<0,0,0 This phone> saved me <1,0,0 two hundred dollars>. I was accidentally pushed into <2,0,0 a creek> and after taking <3,0,0 the battery> out and drying <4,0,0 it> for a day <5,0,0 the phone> booted right up. I don't recommend <6,0,0 this> but I had taken <7,0,0 the charging cover>, <8,0,0 which> seals <9,0,0 the port> from <10,0,0 water>, off because <11,0,0 it> was hard to remove. <12,0,0 The screen shift, home and back> <13,0,0 buttons> feel simply awesome and are <14,0,0 a good tradeoff> for <15,0,0 the fingerprint reader>. <16,0,0 The battery life> could be better. <17,0,0 The screen> could be superb instead of <18,0,0 just good>. But <19,0,0 that>'s <20,0,0 nitpicking>. <21,0,0 This phone> is perfect for someone <22,0,0 who> wants <23,0,0 a good, sim card accessible, removable battery phone>. Someone <24,0,0 who> doesn't want to pay top dollar for <25,0,0 the latest model>. Very happy with <26,0,0 this purchase>.
<0,0,0 This phone> works very well. We are overall very pleased with <1,0,0 it>. I would have given <2,0,0 it> <3,0,0 5 stars> but <4,0,0 they> stated <5,0,0 it> would be new and <6,0,0 it> is apparently not, there are <7,0,0 a few bumps and scratches> on <8,0,0 the exterior> and <9,0,0 the back plate> <10,0,0 that> keeps <11,0,0 it> <12,0,0 waterproof> doesn't snap in <13,0,0 all the way> so <14,0,0 it> really isn't waterproof. <15,0,0 That> was <16,0,0 the biggest bummer>. For <17,0,0 the price> though I am happy with <18,0,0 my purchase>.
I broke <0,0,0 my Samsung s5>. <1,0,0 My hubby> bought me <2,0,0 this one>. I love <3,0,0 this phone>, but Beware of purchasing <4,0,0 used phones>. <5,0,0 This phone> has a significant amount of <6,0,0 issues> for being sold as <7,0,0 a perfectly working used phone>. <8,0,0 The camera> is awful. <9,0,0 The number pad> will not allow you to enter <10,0,0 codes> correctly, like <11,0,0 your voice mail> sometimes. You will hear <12,0,0 keys> pressed several times during <13,0,0 conversations>, and <14,0,0 it> didn't happen on <15,0,0 either end> on <16,0,0 accident>. I am still using <17,0,0 this phone> in <18,0,0 a limited way>, Until I can upgrade to <19,0,0 a new phone>.
I love <0,0,0 this phone>, I bought <1,0,0 it> four months ago, after I was sick of having to delete so much of <2,0,0 my stuff> to save <3,0,0 storage> on <4,0,0 my iPhone 5> <5,0,0 that> I was using. <6,0,0 What> can I say, at <7,0,0 half the price> of <8,0,0 a phone> I bought years ago, I am so pleased! <9,0,0 The display and color> are beautiful, <10,0,0 the back camera> and <11,0,0 even the front camera> are great, I love <12,0,0 how much storage> is already on <13,0,0 it> and that you can add as much as you want. With as much as I use <14,0,0 my phone>, <15,0,0 the battery> lasts from the time I wake up until I go to <16,0,0 bed>, and <17,0,0 this phone> is pretty darn durable too. I have <18,0,0 a glass screen protector> and <19,0,0 a clear silicone case>, and <20,0,0 my phone> hasn't gotten <21,0,0 any scratches or dings> on <22,0,0 it> in four months! <23,0,0 The only complaint> I have about <24,0,0 this phone> is that <25,0,0 it> overheats, but I take <26,0,0 care> of <27,0,0 that> using <28,0,0 a cleaner app> (<29,0,0 which> resolves <30,0,0 the issue> pretty well). <31,0,0 This phone> is definitely worth <32,0,0 it>!
I love <0,0,0 this phone>. I've been using <1,0,0 it> for several months now. I upgraded from <2,0,0 a Galaxy SII> and <3,0,0 the difference> is <4,0,0 night and day>. I didn't want <5,0,0 a screen> <6,0,0 the size> of <7,0,0 the Note> and I was interested in <8,0,0 the water "resistant" design>. The first week I had <9,0,0 the phone> I had <10,0,0 it> in <11,0,0 my shirt pocket>, <12,0,0 bent> over and <13,0,0 it> fell into <14,0,0 a puddle> and was completely submerged. Picked <15,0,0 it> up, rinsed <16,0,0 it> off and <17,0,0 it>'s been fine ever since. <18,0,0 The GPS> is excellent, better than <19,0,0 my Garmin>, and <20,0,0 the screen> works great in <21,0,0 direct sunlight>. I'm not <22,0,0 a heavy duty smart phone user> <23,0,0 so> I didn't need <24,0,0 the latest cutting edge> in <25,0,0 cellphones>, I've been EXTREMELY happy with <26,0,0 this phone>. Also, with <27,0,0 Wifi> turned off I can get about two days without charging and only be down to <28,0,0 about 30% battery life> left. <29,0,0 This phone> is also extremely efficient with <30,0,0 my mobile data> as compared to <31,0,0 my SII>. So good in <32,0,0 fact> that I simply leave <33,0,0 the mobile data> turned on <34,0,0 all the time>.
Purchased <0,0,0 this> used phone through <1,0,0 VeritasCellular>. Absolutely satisfied with <2,0,0 the phone> and <3,0,0 the seller service>. <4,0,0 The description> of <5,0,0 the phone> was spot on (excellent), with <6,0,0 only a few minor scratches> on <7,0,0 the back>, <8,0,0 it> looks like <9,0,0 new>, with <10,0,0 no wear spots>. I spent the day going through <11,0,0 all the menus> to make sure <12,0,0 everything works>. <13,0,0 This phone> replaced <14,0,0 a iPhone 5S>, I found <15,0,0 it> frustrating at times to operate, <16,0,0 the Android menus> are easier and faster to navigate. Since I travel in <17,0,0 areas> where <18,0,0 internet service> is nearly non-existent, speaking <19,0,0 a text message> or phone number while driving is sometimes necessary for me, but apparently <20,0,0 Siri> needs <21,0,0 an internet connection> to work. <22,0,0 Love> <23,0,0 the Galaxy S5>, and thank you Veritascellular.
I purchased <0,0,0 my S5> Active from <1,0,0 ECELLULAR> for $215 <2,0,0 the evening> of September 11th. <3,0,0 It> was shipped the next day from <4,0,0 Tennessee> and I received <5,0,0 it> here in <6,0,0 Texas> <7,0,0 yesterday>, <8,0,0 the 14th>. There are <9,0,0 a couple> of <10,0,0 dings> on <11,0,0 the corners and edges> of <12,0,0 the phone> but <13,0,0 nothing> too major. <14,0,0 The screen> is perfect, <15,0,0 absolutely no scratches>. As far as I can tell <16,0,0 the phone> is preforming exactly as <17,0,0 it> should. I am happy with <18,0,0 my purchase> and now <19,0,0 even my husband> is considering getting <20,0,0 one> for himself.
<0,0,0 The memory space> on <1,0,0 this phone> is not expandable; of <2,0,0 this>, I was not aware. I am <3,0,0 an avid pic taker> and <4,0,0 this> apparently has filled up <5,0,0 my photos>. <6,0,0 My husband> has <7,0,0 another galaxy phone> he loves. <8,0,0 His> is expandable. <9,0,0 My camera> has never seemed as great as <10,0,0 the claims>. and <11,0,0 my microphone> is crackly if I am on <12,0,0 speaker>, therefore I cannot use <13,0,0 it>.
<0,0,0 Love> <1,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active phone>. I live in <2,0,0 the country> and have <3,0,0 a rugged lifestyle>. <4,0,0 The S5> Active has fit <5,0,0 my needs> easily. I do keep <6,0,0 a protective case> on <7,0,0 it> and I have dropped <8,0,0 mine> on <9,0,0 occasion>. I have yet to have <10,0,0 it> submerged in <11,0,0 water> (hopefully I never will) but if <12,0,0 it> lives up to <13,0,0 its billing> <14,0,0 that> should be <15,0,0 no problem>!
Upgraded from <0,0,0 a Samsung Galaxy S3> and I like <1,0,0 this phone> much better - <2,0,0 the larger screen> is easier for <3,0,0 an old guy> like me to read, and <4,0,0 the battery life> is much improved over <5,0,0 the S3>. If I had known better though I would have purchased <6,0,0 a regular S5> rather <7,0,0 the S5> active. I thought <8,0,0 the black corners> were <9,0,0 rubber or protective material>, but <10,0,0 they> are just plastic - there doesn't appear to be <11,0,0 any better protection> than on <12,0,0 the regular S5>, and you lose <13,0,0 several features> with <14,0,0 the S5> Active - <15,0,0 no fingerprint reader>, <16,0,0 no USB 3 connector> (<17,0,0 which> means <18,0,0 the Active> takes twice as long to charge as <19,0,0 the standard S5)>, and <20,0,0 the Active> doesn't work with <21,0,0 wireless charging systems>. Overall <22,0,0 a great phone> though.
<0,0,0 It> was received in <1,0,0 a timely manner>, before <2,0,0 another purchase> from <3,0,0 Amazon> made a week previously actually. <4,0,0 My only complaint> is <5,0,0 it> will not send <6,0,0 picture messages>. That and how <7,0,0 it> was shipped only in <8,0,0 an envelope> wrapped in <9,0,0 minimal bubble wrap>. <10,0,0 Good thing> is that <11,0,0 this phone> is supposed to be durable. As far as <12,0,0 the phone> being <13,0,0 water proof> I've read many bad reviews. I for <14,0,0 one hope> to never find out! Also for <15,0,0 the supposed durability> I have yet to drop <16,0,0 this phone> on <17,0,0 a concrete floor>, or <18,0,0 any other surface> <19,0,0 that> hard. As I said YET! I sure hope if I do <20,0,0 it> will stand up to <21,0,0 Samsungs> claims! Before I chose <22,0,0 this phone> I did hours of <23,0,0 research> there are many other great phones out there but <24,0,0 nothing> <25,0,0 that> combines <26,0,0 the durability factor> with <27,0,0 all the bells and whistles> as <28,0,0 this one> does so nicely. <29,0,0 The battery life> is also great! I'm on <30,0,0 my phone> non-stop and a get a full day from <31,0,0 the battery>. <32,0,0 It> sure beats having to charge <33,0,0 my phone multiple times> a day or carrying <34,0,0 a charger> with me everywhere I go! Now I just keep <35,0,0 only the places> I'm at <36,0,0 the most>, just in <37,0,0 case> I forget to charge <38,0,0 it> at <39,0,0 night> before I go to <40,0,0 bed>.
I bought <0,0,0 this phone> and I'm happy with <1,0,0 it>. <2,0,0 This> is <3,0,0 the first cell phone> I own. <4,0,0 The only thing> I didn't like is <5,0,0 the small Samsung key pad>. In <6,0,0 the controls> <7,0,0 it> can be made bigger. I bought <8,0,0 a styles>, now <9,0,0 the phone> is <10,0,0 a dream> to operate. Some people complained about <11,0,0 water intrusion>. <12,0,0 The operating instructions> tell you how to make sure that <13,0,0 the battery cover> is down properly, also that <14,0,0 the charging port> is closed. When you disconnect <15,0,0 the charger> <16,0,0 the phone> prompts you to close <17,0,0 the cover>. I got <18,0,0 a strong protective cover> to give <19,0,0 the phone> <20,0,0 a good chance> to survive <21,0,0 a tough outdoor environment>. Using <22,0,0 this phone> is extremely addicting.
I love <0,0,0 this phone>! I was debating between <1,0,0 the regular S5> and <2,0,0 the S5> Active, and I'm so glad I chose <3,0,0 the Active>. I've dropped <4,0,0 my phone numerous times> already and not even <5,0,0 a dent or scratch> on <6,0,0 it>.
I upgraded from <0,0,0 an S3> and am very happy with <1,0,0 my S5>. I only have <2,0,0 a couple> of <3,0,0 complaints>, <4,0,0 the first> of <5,0,0 which> is <6,0,0 the replacement> of <7,0,0 the menu/options button> with <8,0,0 a recent apps button>. <9,0,0 This> was already easily accessible by holding <10,0,0 the home button> for <11,0,0 about 1 second so> I'm not sure why <12,0,0 it> needed <13,0,0 its own dedicated button>. <14,0,0 My other complaint> is <15,0,0 the size>. <16,0,0 It> no longer fits comfortably in <17,0,0 my pocket or car> drink <18,0,0 holder> but then again, I knew <19,0,0 it> was big when I ordered and got <20,0,0 it> for <21,0,0 its supposed durability>. Overall, <22,0,0 it>'s <23,0,0 a great phone> with <24,0,0 a bright, crisp display> and <25,0,0 fast processor>.
I have only been using <0,0,0 this phone> for a few days so far, but I have tweaked <1,0,0 all the settings> and checked out <2,0,0 all> of <3,0,0 the features>. <4,0,0 My previous phone> was <5,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket>, so I skipped <6,0,0 a few generations> in between there. <7,0,0 The S5> Active is definitely <8,0,0 a huge improvement> over <9,0,0 the S2>! <10,0,0 My only disappointment> with <11,0,0 this phone>, and <12,0,0 it> is very minor, is that I had thought <13,0,0 the black bumpers> around <14,0,0 the edges> were going to be more rubberized. <15,0,0 They> are not. <16,0,0 They> are hard, <17,0,0 matte plastic>. <18,0,0 It> makes me think that if <19,0,0 it> were to hit <20,0,0 the ground> hard enough, <21,0,0 those black pieces> would crack. I will probably end up buying <22,0,0 a case> of <23,0,0 some sort>, just for <24,0,0 a little extra protection>.
I just received <0,0,0 this> on Saturday so I haven't had <1,0,0 a chance> to get to <2,0,0 most> of <3,0,0 it> but <4,0,0 this> is <5,0,0 the best phone> I've ever owned. I'm <6,0,0 a musician> and <7,0,0 the music player> is superb and <8,0,0 this> is <9,0,0 the first phone> with <10,0,0 a strong Bluetooth>. I can't get <11,0,0 it> to disconnect to either <12,0,0 my Active2 ear buds> or <13,0,0 my Sony DR-BT50> over <14,0,0 the ear headphones>. <15,0,0 Every other phone> I've owned, <16,0,0 a Behold, Exhibit> and <17,0,0 two Galaxy SII><18,0,0 's> all disconnect if you get <19,0,0 a body part> in <20,0,0 the way>. I'm finally happy with <21,0,0 BLUETOOTH>. <22,0,0 The phone><23,0,0 's screen> is beautiful and there aren't <24,0,0 many HD Glass protector><25,0,0 's> yet <26,0,0 that> are affordable. I purchased <27,0,0 a SUPCASE> for <28,0,0 it> but <29,0,0 it> made <30,0,0 it> to <31,0,0 large and heavy> for me so I returned <32,0,0 it> and am waiting for <33,0,0 an Exact Soft Gel skin> to protect <34,0,0 it> as <35,0,0 it> is somewhat slippery to <36,0,0 the touch>. I've owned <37,0,0 two different Galaxy SII><38,0,0 's> and <39,0,0 this> is blazing fast compared to <40,0,0 those two>. <41,0,0 It> seems <42,0,0 a bit more user friendly> also. I'll update <43,0,0 this> when I have <44,0,0 more> to say but for <45,0,0 now>, <46,0,0 WOW>.
I bought <0,0,0 a refurbished version> of <1,0,0 this phone>. Never again will I buy <2,0,0 anything electronic> <3,0,0 that> has been refurbished. <4,0,0 It> was great at first, but now, only 5 months of having <5,0,0 it>, had developed <6,0,0 extremely annoying issues>. <7,0,0 Some> of <8,0,0 which> are costing me time doing <9,0,0 my job>. At times, <10,0,0 the Internet connection> dies and <11,0,0 the icon> disappears from <12,0,0 the status bar> (even with <13,0,0 a solid digital signal)>. <14,0,0 It> does not return on <15,0,0 its own>. I have to restart <16,0,0 the phone> each time. <17,0,0 Average rate> of <18,0,0 occurrence> is twice weekly. But now, in <19,0,0 the last couple> of days, <20,0,0 the speaker> will not play <21,0,0 any sound> at all. <22,0,0 Volumes> in <23,0,0 all places> are checked and found to be at <24,0,0 max setting>. <25,0,0 A litmus test> using <26,0,0 an app> <27,0,0 that> bypasses <28,0,0 phone volume settings> in <29,0,0 favor> of <30,0,0 its own> only has <31,0,0 vibrate> functioning then as well. So, restart required for that as well. I don't know <32,0,0 its frequency> yet. <33,0,0 This thing> isn't starting to become <34,0,0 a remorseful purchase>; <35,0,0 it> has already become that. Especially for <36,0,0 the price> <37,0,0 it> cost. Never ever again.
<0,0,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 lite>, fast, <2,0,0 crystal clear screen and voice>. Plusly <3,0,0 it>’s easy to use. I have <4,0,0 vision> and <5,0,0 hearing loss>. <6,0,0 This phone> is great for people like me when set up to <7,0,0 Easy mode>. <8,0,0 Battery life> is outstanding, add <9,0,0 wireless charging>, <10,0,0 no cables> to <11,0,0 mess> with, just pick <12,0,0 it> up and talk! YES! I am blown away to say <13,0,0 the least>! <14,0,0 Lastly my iPhone friends> have all fallen in <15,0,0 Love> with <16,0,0 it>. Added <17,0,0 a clear case> from <18,0,0 Amazon real wow factor>. Buy <19,0,0 this phone>!
<0,0,0 This> is <1,0,0 an excellent phone> with <2,0,0 dual sim capability>. <3,0,0 This phone> seems to be intended for <4,0,0 middle eastern market>. <5,0,0 One disadvantage> of <6,0,0 this phone> is that <7,0,0 it> does not support <8,0,0 Samsung pay>, <9,0,0 which> is only supported on the US models of <10,0,0 S7>. Other than <11,0,0 that>, <12,0,0 everything> is <13,0,0 exactly the same>. <14,0,0 The US model> does not offer <15,0,0 dual sim capability>. <16,0,0 The phone> came in <17,0,0 a completely sealed box> and <18,0,0 the box> had <19,0,0 no signs> <20,0,0 that> indicated that <21,0,0 it> was opened before being shipped out.
<0,0,0 The S7> is <1,0,0 a very good smartphone>. <2,0,0 It> is exactly <3,0,0 what> I expected and works fine with <4,0,0 my carrier> in <5,0,0 USA (T Mobile) and outside US> too. However, <6,0,0 the slot> for <7,0,0 the 2 Sim card> is <8,0,0 the same> that carries <9,0,0 the expandable memory>. So you will not be able to use <10,0,0 the memory> at the same time with <11,0,0 the 2 Sim cards>. <12,0,0 This> is very disappointing! In <13,0,0 the S5> with <14,0,0 double Sim card>, you're able to have <15,0,0 both> <16,0,0 Sim cards> and expanded <17,0,0 memory> working all together.
I've owned many different phones over the years. <0,0,0 My first real smart phone> was <1,0,0 a Samsung S3> and was <2,0,0 a great phone>. I recently purchased <3,0,0 this S7> <4,0,0 Edge> and can say <5,0,0 it> is <6,0,0 the best phone> I've ever had. I recommend getting <7,0,0 the International version> like <8,0,0 mine>. <9,0,0 All the chatter> about <10,0,0 it> on <11,0,0 the Web> is <12,0,0 spot> on. <13,0,0 It> is <14,0,0 the fastest, smoothest, best> of <15,0,0 everything> in <16,0,0 a smart phone> <17,0,0 that> <18,0,0 money> can buy <19,0,0 today>. <20,0,0 My only complaint> is that <21,0,0 TouchWiz> needs <22,0,0 more work>. I really want to use <23,0,0 it> but ended up back to <24,0,0 Nova launcher> to get <25,0,0 basic features>, like <26,0,0 vertical app drawer scroll> and <27,0,0 such>. <28,0,0 TouchWiz> needs <29,0,0 more features> control to truly be useful. However, <30,0,0 this> has <31,0,0 nothing> to do with how wonderful <32,0,0 the S7 Edge International 935FD> truly is!
I upgraded to <0,0,0 this phone> from <1,0,0 a Galaxy Note> <2,0,0 III> and <3,0,0 it> is <4,0,0 loads> better - faster; <5,0,0 better screen>; <6,0,0 much better camera (LOVE> <7,0,0 the camera)>. <8,0,0 The display> is so clear and colorful, <9,0,0 it> is simply <10,0,0 a joy> to hold and behold. <11,0,0 Any drawbacks>? You do have to hold <12,0,0 it> carefully so you aren't pressing <13,0,0 the wrap-around screen> and confusing <14,0,0 it> with <15,0,0 what> you want to do. Worth <16,0,0 it>? You bet.
I purchased <0,0,0 this phone> to replace <1,0,0 my malfunctioning HTC One M7>. At <2,0,0 first glance> I have to say <3,0,0 the screen> is gorgeous. I have watched <4,0,0 Youtube videos> and <5,0,0 other short clips> and was amazed at <6,0,0 the crisp color and motion>. When taking <7,0,0 photos>, <8,0,0 the pictures> were nice. When I zoomed in on <9,0,0 the phone> I did start to notice <10,0,0 some minor pixelation> so I will most likely <11,0,0 stick> to <12,0,0 my Sony DSLR> if I really <13,0,0 what> to take <14,0,0 distant shots>. I have <15,0,0 a few games> <16,0,0 that> I play and <17,0,0 the controls> are seamless and react with <18,0,0 un-noticeable delays>. I have used <19,0,0 the fingerprint login> for <20,0,0 my phone and other apps> but I can’t get <21,0,0 it> to consistently work. <22,0,0 Calls> are clear and I like <23,0,0 the volume boost option> although <24,0,0 it> is disabled for <25,0,0 my Bluetooth headphones>. <26,0,0 The battery life> is fair with <27,0,0 the phone> running for a full day with <28,0,0 Wifi, Bluetooth, location> and <29,0,0 mobile data> <30,0,0 each> being on. There is also <31,0,0 a battery> save <32,0,0 mode> <33,0,0 that> will cause <34,0,0 the phone> to become <35,0,0 grayscale and limit> <36,0,0 which> <37,0,0 apps> can be open while preserving <38,0,0 messaging> and calling. <39,0,0 That> is <40,0,0 a huge battery boost>. Overall, I am highly impressed with <41,0,0 this product> and I am hopeful that <42,0,0 it> will last for many years to come.
<0,0,0 Everything> you've read about <1,0,0 this phone> is true. <2,0,0 It> is amazing. <3,0,0 The screen> is second only to <4,0,0 the S7 (>in <5,0,0 terms> of <6,0,0 ppi)>, <7,0,0 the camera> is arguably <8,0,0 the best> on <9,0,0 the market>, and <10,0,0 it> is <11,0,0 a monster> in <12,0,0 battery life and performance>. <13,0,0 Silver Titanium> is undoubtedly <14,0,0 the best color>. Absolutely stunning. If <15,0,0 Samsung> found <16,0,0 a way> to implement <17,0,0 stereo audio>, <18,0,0 it> would be perfect, but <19,0,0 it> makes up for <20,0,0 what> <21,0,0 it> lacks in <22,0,0 sound quality> in <23,0,0 its relative loudness> and <24,0,0 top> of <25,0,0 the line headphone output>. Rest assured that you are buying <26,0,0 the best phone> on <27,0,0 the market> right now.
<0,0,0 This> is <1,0,0 the best cell phone> I have. <2,0,0 The size> is <3,0,0 almost the same> as <4,0,0 Samsung S5>, except <5,0,0 the format edge> give us <6,0,0 a very pleasant touch and view>! <7,0,0 The camera> is exceptional, have <8,0,0 auto focus> and <9,0,0 it> is impossible to have <10,0,0 bad pictures>. <11,0,0 The only problem> is that <12,0,0 it> is so sensitive that <13,0,0 a single harder touch> can become <14,0,0 multiple pictures>. <15,0,0 This> is definitely <16,0,0 the best Samsung S series phone>, and if <17,0,0 the money> is not <18,0,0 the problem>, forget <19,0,0 the S7> and go to <20,0,0 the S7> <21,0,0 Edge>!
<0,0,0 The phone> <1,0,0 itself> works nice, very smooth and lots of <2,0,0 storage>. I've already dropped <3,0,0 it> several times and <4,0,0 it> has not cracked. <5,0,0 It>'s very durable. <6,0,0 The biggest drawback> is definitely <7,0,0 the camera>. <8,0,0 It>'s <9,0,0 absolute garbage>. If you're not looking to take <10,0,0 high quality photos>, then <11,0,0 this> is <12,0,0 a really great phone> overall. But if you’re looking to take <13,0,0 really nice pictures>, I'd keep looking for <14,0,0 something> else.
I upgraded to <0,0,0 the LG Stylo 2> from <1,0,0 my old Galaxy S3> and I have been very happy with <2,0,0 the LG>. I spent time comparing <3,0,0 it> to <4,0,0 the other available Virgin phones>, and <5,0,0 the Samsung J7> is closest in <6,0,0 specs>, but significantly more expensive. For me <7,0,0 the large screen> was <8,0,0 the biggest selling point> and that coupled with <9,0,0 the lower price> sold me on <10,0,0 the Stylo 2>. <11,0,0 This phone> is very responsive, quick, and <12,0,0 an all-round good performer>. <13,0,0 Battery life> is superb, I can keep <14,0,0 that big screen> on for hours and still have 60-70% charge (your mileage may vary depending on <15,0,0 brightness> and <16,0,0 what> you have running). And <17,0,0 the phone> has <18,0,0 sufficient on-board memory> to hold <19,0,0 plenty> of <20,0,0 apps, photos, and music (>and you can add <21,0,0 an SD> for <22,0,0 more space>: <23,0,0 2GB operating RAM>, <24,0,0 16 GB storage space> out of <25,0,0 the box)>.
Loving <0,0,0 my Stylo> <1,0,0 2 phone> with <2,0,0 Virgin Mobile>. <3,0,0 It> is <4,0,0 everything> I was expecting and <5,0,0 more>. <6,0,0 Wonderfully large format screen>, <7,0,0 good resolution>, <8,0,0 great camera> and <9,0,0 plenty> of <10,0,0 storage (an issue> with <11,0,0 my previous phone)>. <12,0,0 The phone> is quick, responsive and <13,0,0 the audio quality> is <14,0,0 first rate>. <15,0,0 The incredibly slim design> really necessitates <16,0,0 a good case> with <17,0,0 some grip> or you could easily loose hold of <18,0,0 it>. I got <19,0,0 a lovely fold> over <20,0,0 case> <21,0,0 that> is doing <22,0,0 the job> beautifully. I couldn't be happier with <23,0,0 this phone>. Excellent, and I mean <24,0,0 excellent value> for <25,0,0 the cost>!
<0,0,0 Stylo 2> is great. <1,0,0 Nice big screen>. <2,0,0 Battery> could be better and <3,0,0 camera> is <4,0,0 OK needs> <5,0,0 more settings>. <6,0,0 Wifi> works good. <7,0,0 Talk> is good and clear. <8,0,0 Wireless> charging would be nice. Over <9,0,0 all a great phone> for <10,0,0 the price>. If you are looking for <11,0,0 a fast processor phone>, <12,0,0 this> is not for you. You need to pay <13,0,0 the higher price> for <14,0,0 a better phone> but if you do <15,0,0 a few apps> and <16,0,0 few games> you will be OK.
<0,0,0 Good upgrade> from <1,0,0 the first Stylo>. <2,0,0 It> has <3,0,0 some features> that <4,0,0 the Stylo 1> did not. <5,0,0 This> includes <6,0,0 more internal memory>. I would say if you have <7,0,0 the Stylo 1>, <8,0,0 the Stylo 2> may take time to grow on you as <9,0,0 some features> are different but after <10,0,0 a week or so> wasn't <11,0,0 a game changer>. Either <12,0,0 phone> is great but <13,0,0 the Stylo 2> has doubled <14,0,0 the internal memory> than <15,0,0 the Stylo 1>. I would recommend either <16,0,0 phone and Virgin Mobile>.
<0,0,0 Stylo 2> is <1,0,0 a great phone>. <2,0,0 It> is very fast with <3,0,0 plenty> of <4,0,0 storage> for <5,0,0 apps>. <6,0,0 SD card slot> is good for storing <7,0,0 music>, <8,0,0 videos>, and <9,0,0 pictures>. I thought <10,0,0 the camera> was fine for <11,0,0 a phone>. <12,0,0 The screen> looks great for <13,0,0 a 5.7 inch>. <14,0,0 Sound> was loud and OK. <15,0,0 Stylus> is <16,0,0 a plus> and works well. <17,0,0 Only one thing> I see maybe <18,0,0 a problem> is <19,0,0 screen> may break very easy on <20,0,0 even small drops>. I got <21,0,0 a heavy duty case> to protect <22,0,0 it>. I did play <23,0,0 a few games> on <24,0,0 it> with <25,0,0 no problems>. <26,0,0 Battery life> has been very good but just like <27,0,0 any other phone>, <28,0,0 things> like <29,0,0 GPS> and <30,0,0 certain apps> running in <31,0,0 background> can eat <32,0,0 battery> up. <33,0,0 Phone> also has <34,0,0 an easy mode> <35,0,0 that> is good for people <36,0,0 that> don't like a lot of <37,0,0 confusion> and tend to get frustrated with <38,0,0 technology>.
<0,0,0 Stylo> is great. I love <1,0,0 the size and clarity> of <2,0,0 the screen>. Takes <3,0,0 great HD pics>. Would definitely recommend for <4,0,0 the price and shipping> was fast. <5,0,0 Battery> lasts me all day and I am always on <6,0,0 phone>. <7,0,0 Phone storage> is a small amount but get <8,0,0 the 32gb SD card> and you will be fine.
I like <0,0,0 this phone> because <1,0,0 it> is neat and has <2,0,0 good features>. I left <3,0,0 it> by <4,0,0 accident> in <5,0,0 my car> and <6,0,0 the heat> caused <7,0,0 the screen> to go white. Fortunately, I removed <8,0,0 the battery> and cooled down <9,0,0 the phone>. When I put <10,0,0 it> back together, <11,0,0 it> worked perfectly. I also dropped <12,0,0 it> once and <13,0,0 it> was surprisingly sturdy although I plan never to let <14,0,0 that> happen again. I plan to have <15,0,0 this phone> for <16,0,0 a while>! I would recommend <17,0,0 it>.
<0,0,0 This phone> is very slim, cute and easy to use. <1,0,0 It> is <2,0,0 a flip phone> and can be opened easily with <3,0,0 one hand>. Setting up <4,0,0 this phone> was <5,0,0 a piece> of <6,0,0 cake>. <7,0,0 It> came with <8,0,0 an adaptor plug> <9,0,0 which> can fit <10,0,0 any A/C plug>. <11,0,0 The only negative> is that <12,0,0 it> didn't come with <13,0,0 a driver CD> and <14,0,0 a data cable>. <15,0,0 A big plus> was that <16,0,0 it> was unlocked and was able to accept <17,0,0 any SIM card>. <18,0,0 GREAT PHONE>.
<0,0,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,0 an awesome, capable, gorgeous phone>. <2,0,0 It> can do so much. From <3,0,0 business> to <4,0,0 gaming>, <5,0,0 it> covers at all. <6,0,0 The screen> is gorgeous. <7,0,0 The CPU rocks> and is fast. You can add <8,0,0 storage space (>unlike <9,0,0 the Note5)>. I got <10,0,0 mine> for <11,0,0 a killer price> and I love <12,0,0 it>!
I recently got <0,0,0 this phone> and have been using <1,0,0 it> for a week and <2,0,0 it> works pretty well. <3,0,0 It> came in really clean and I only saw <4,0,0 one tiny scratch> but <5,0,0 it> wasn't really noticeable at all. I love <6,0,0 my new phone> and plus, I got <7,0,0 it> for <8,0,0 a cheap price> while <9,0,0 it> looked <10,0,0 brand> new! However, <11,0,0 the screen> was <12,0,0 kind> of <13,0,0 weird appearing> because <14,0,0 it> had a little faded <15,0,0 label> inside of <16,0,0 it>? But <17,0,0 that> wasn't really noticeable. Overall, I think <18,0,0 this phone> has <19,0,0 all 5 stars> of <20,0,0 functionality>, <21,0,0 appearance>, and <22,0,0 shipment> too! I really recommend <23,0,0 this> to <24,0,0 the other customers> and <25,0,0 they> won't regret on buying <26,0,0 it>!
<0,0,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 a great phone>. I really love <2,0,0 the camera> and <3,0,0 the stylus>. I have not had <4,0,0 many problems>. <5,0,0 The only problem> I had was with <6,0,0 the battery>, <7,0,0 it> would not hold <8,0,0 a charge>, but <9,0,0 the seller> sent me <10,0,0 a new battery> and <11,0,0 it> works great! I have taken <12,0,0 many photos> and <13,0,0 they> <14,0,0 all> turned out great. <15,0,0 The front facing camera> has <16,0,0 a> built in <17,0,0 face tuning software> so <18,0,0 it> helps with hiding <19,0,0 blemishes> and does <20,0,0 it> automatically, but you can turn <21,0,0 it> off if you do not want <22,0,0 it>. I love how fast <23,0,0 the phone> is and <24,0,0 it>’s great for playing <25,0,0 games>, watching <26,0,0 movies> and <27,0,0 everything>. <28,0,0 The 2K screen> is amazing; <29,0,0 movies>, <30,0,0 TV shows>, <31,0,0 YouTube> and <32,0,0 Netflix> all look great on <33,0,0 the screen>. <34,0,0 The screen> is very <35,0,0 responsive and fast moving>, I actually enjoy <36,0,0 the Touchwiz UI (User Interface)>. I do not have <37,0,0 any complaints> about <38,0,0 this phone>, I really love <39,0,0 it> and enjoy using <40,0,0 it>. I highly recommend <41,0,0 this phone> for anyone <42,0,0 who> is thinking about getting <43,0,0 one>.
I've been very pleased with <0,0,0 this phone> so far, <1,0,0 the camera> is great, <2,0,0 the screen> is very clear and east to read. If you like <3,0,0 big phones>, <4,0,0 this> is <5,0,0 the phone> for you. I've had a few times where <6,0,0 the screen> would just go black, but <7,0,0 it>'s just <8,0,0 the app> closing down, so I'm not sure about <9,0,0 that>. <10,0,0 The phone> had little to <11,0,0 no scratches>, in <12,0,0 great condition>. I'm glad I got <13,0,0 it>! And <14,0,0 such a good price>, too.
I've been using <0,0,0 this phone> for three weeks now. <1,0,0 It>'s <2,0,0 a bit> large but <3,0,0 the screen size> is very easy on <4,0,0 my eyes>. <5,0,0 Operations> are very quick and I appreciate having <6,0,0 the 3 GB> of <7,0,0 memory>. Haven't used <8,0,0 the stylus> yet, but I have used <9,0,0 one> on <10,0,0 the Note 10.1>, so I believe <11,0,0 it> will work <12,0,0 the same>. <13,0,0 This> is <14,0,0 a refurbished phone> and despite <15,0,0 some scratches> on <16,0,0 the back surface>, <17,0,0 it> looks good. I have housed <18,0,0 it> in <19,0,0 a decent case> to protect <20,0,0 it>, <21,0,0 which> added <22,0,0 some weight>, but overall I am very pleased with <23,0,0 this phone>.
<0,0,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,0 my current phone>. I switched from <2,0,0 the Galaxy S5> <3,0,0 which> by <4,0,0 the way> is <5,0,0 my favorite phone> I have ever owned. <6,0,0 The Note 4> is <7,0,0 a great phone>, but compared to <8,0,0 the S5> <9,0,0 it> falls short in <10,0,0 many ways>. <11,0,0 The first being durability>. I was comfortable carrying <12,0,0 my S5> around without <13,0,0 a case>, I am <14,0,0 an outdoors man> and I had <15,0,0 no worries> of dropping <16,0,0 the phone> on <17,0,0 the ground> or in <18,0,0 a river>. <19,0,0 The Note 4> is less durable and I find myself uncomfortable carrying <20,0,0 it> without <21,0,0 a case> on <22,0,0 it>. If you are in <23,0,0 the market> for <24,0,0 a multitasking, S pen writing>, <25,0,0 large screen phone> then <26,0,0 the Note 4> is <27,0,0 the choice> for you! If you are looking for <28,0,0 a more durable phone> with <29,0,0 a smaller screen> then I say take <30,0,0 a look> at <31,0,0 the S5>.
I upgraded to <0,0,0 the Note 4 three weeks> ago from <1,0,0 Galaxy S5>, and I love <2,0,0 this phone>! I was a little concerned about <3,0,0 the size>, but now <4,0,0 that> I have had <5,0,0 it> for <6,0,0 a while>, <7,0,0 it> does not seem <8,0,0 that> big! <9,0,0 The screen> is beautiful and <10,0,0 it> is super fast! I have used <11,0,0 the S pen> a little, but not <12,0,0 that> into <13,0,0 it> yet. I am still learning <14,0,0 all the bells and whistles>, but from <15,0,0 what> I have learned so far I know beyond <16,0,0 a shadow> of <17,0,0 a doubt> that <18,0,0 the it> is better than <19,0,0 the iPhone 6 Plus>! <20,0,0 Great phone>! <21,0,0 Great specs>! <22,0,0 Great camera>! And <23,0,0 excellent battery life>! I highly recommend <24,0,0 it>!
<0,0,0 Note 4> is <1,0,0 a great phone>! <2,0,0 The speed> of <3,0,0 the processor> is amazing. I have used <4,0,0 IPhones> and <5,0,0 they> do not even come close to <6,0,0 this device>. <7,0,0 Android><8,0,0 's OS> paired with <9,0,0 this device> has made <10,0,0 my life> so much easier. <11,0,0 The large screen size> is great for <12,0,0 my over 50 eyes>! Do not get <13,0,0 an iPhone>, get <14,0,0 a Samsung> Note <15,0,0 4>!
I love <0,0,0 my Galaxy Note 4>. I came from <1,0,0 a LG G3> and <2,0,0 it> is by far <3,0,0 the better phone>. <4,0,0 The battery life> is really good for <5,0,0 as large> of <6,0,0 a screen> as <7,0,0 it> has and even when I use <8,0,0 my mobile Hotspot function>, <9,0,0 it> doesn't drain as rapidly as <10,0,0 other phone> had in <11,0,0 the past>.
I've had <0,0,0 my iPhone 6>+ since <1,0,0 launch> and <2,0,0 it>'s served me very well. <3,0,0 It> fits <4,0,0 my hand> perfectly and trying to use <5,0,0 a smaller phone> now makes me feel like <6,0,0 a giant>. <7,0,0 It>'s very fast and <8,0,0 the 128 GB> has lots of <9,0,0 storage>. <10,0,0 The only problem> is recently <11,0,0 the touch screen> hasn't been registering <12,0,0 touch> at times. <13,0,0 The phone> is <14,0,0 almost two years> old and I'm not exactly gentle with <15,0,0 it>, so I don't really blame <16,0,0 the phone>. Still <17,0,0 a great phone>.
I have been using <0,0,0 this phone> for <1,0,0 almost 2 years> now. Although <2,0,0 the actual size> of <3,0,0 the phone> can be intimidating, I absolutely cannot live without <4,0,0 it>. <5,0,0 The larger screen> makes <6,0,0 it> almost like having <7,0,0 a mini iPad> and <8,0,0 phone> all in <9,0,0 one>. I actually use <10,0,0 it> like <11,0,0 a personal computer> <12,0,0 most days>. Surfing <13,0,0 the net>, using <14,0,0 apps>, watching <15,0,0 videos> and <16,0,0 Facetime> are all so much easier with <17,0,0 the larger screen>. <18,0,0 Everything> runs smoothly as long as you keep up with <19,0,0 the software updates> and don't use up <20,0,0 all the storage>. <21,0,0 Battery life> is great, be sure to use <22,0,0 the factory Apple charger>, as <23,0,0 other ones> don't seem to charge as fast. Keeping <24,0,0 a screen protector and case> is also <25,0,0 a must>, as <26,0,0 the screen> can be cracked. Overall I would recommend <27,0,0 this phone> over <28,0,0 all other IPhones> and definitely over <29,0,0 Android devices>. <30,0,0 The ease> of <31,0,0 use> cannot be beat!
<0,0,0 It>'s not worth <1,0,0 its price>. <2,0,0 The Motorola Google Nexus 6> is better and a lot faster and <3,0,0 it>'s <4,0,0 a bit> less expensive than <5,0,0 this crappy phone>. <6,0,0 The point> is that <7,0,0 this phone> even does not have <8,0,0 a Full HD Screen> and <9,0,0 it> only has <10,0,0 1 GB RAM> and <11,0,0 1.4 GHZ Processor> and <12,0,0 only 401 pixels> per <13,0,0 inch>. <14,0,0 The Nexus 6> is a lot faster than <15,0,0 this phone> and better as <16,0,0 a daily driver>.
<0,0,0 The iPhone 6 Plus> is <1,0,0 a huge phone>! <2,0,0 It> can be <3,0,0 bully> to carry, or even just using <4,0,0 it> in <5,0,0 your hand>. But there are <6,0,0 many features> to out <7,0,0 weight> <8,0,0 this>. Coming from <9,0,0 the iPhone 5s> I still see <10,0,0 a major increase> in <11,0,0 CPU and graphics power>. <12,0,0 Another amazing feature> about <13,0,0 this phone> is <14,0,0 the camera>. Although <15,0,0 it> is <16,0,0 only 8 megapixels>, <17,0,0 it> still can take <18,0,0 better pictures> than <19,0,0 most> of <20,0,0 its Android competitors>. <21,0,0 The battery life> on <22,0,0 this phone> is amazing. I can go all day on <23,0,0 heavy use> with lots of <24,0,0 apps>, <25,0,0 web>, and <26,0,0 texting> and still end the day with <27,0,0 40% battery>. Doing <28,0,0 that> on <29,0,0 my iPhone 5s> was impossible. I would usually have to charge in <30,0,0 the early afternoon> on days like <31,0,0 that>. Since buying <32,0,0 this> I don't feel that I need to use <33,0,0 my iPad> as much. There are <34,0,0 some apps> <35,0,0 that> don't work on <36,0,0 the phone> so I have to use <37,0,0 the iPad> but probably at least 75% of <38,0,0 my web> browsing and <39,0,0 amazon shopping> is done on <40,0,0 this device>.
I didn't think I would like <0,0,0 this iPhone>; I was perfectly fine with <1,0,0 my iPhone 4s>. But I needed <2,0,0 a new phone> because <3,0,0 it>'s been 5 years so I went and saw <4,0,0 this phone> and played with <5,0,0 it>. I thought <6,0,0 it> was too big before but <7,0,0 the iPhone 6> is <8,0,0 a perfect size>. I love <9,0,0 the bigger screen> and <10,0,0 the gold color>. <11,0,0 Beautiful phone>. I just wish <12,0,0 they> would drop <13,0,0 the 16GB> and start with <14,0,0 32GB> instead, don't really wanna pay <15,0,0 an extra 100$> for <16,0,0 64GB> and <17,0,0 it>'s too much for me. Other than <18,0,0 that> I would recommend <19,0,0 this phone>.
<0,0,0 This> is <1,0,0 the best phone> on <2,0,0 the market>. From <3,0,0 start> to finish, <4,0,0 this phone> works all day long. <5,0,0 The battery life> is great, even with <6,0,0 very heavy use>. <7,0,0 The camera> is unmatched. <8,0,0 It> may only be <9,0,0 8MP>, but <10,0,0 the software> makes <11,0,0 a huge difference>. You've seen <12,0,0 all the reviews> on <13,0,0 the device>, so <14,0,0 what> I really want to say is that <15,0,0 it>'s really not too big for <16,0,0 daily use>. When <17,0,0 not compared side> by <18,0,0 side> to <19,0,0 another iPhone>, people constantly believe <20,0,0 it>'s <21,0,0 the smaller version>.
I am very happy with <0,0,0 this phone>! I wasn't sure about getting <1,0,0 an iPhone> because I wasn't very happy with <2,0,0 the iPhone 5>, especially when <3,0,0 they> decided to change <4,0,0 all the chargers and adapters> for <5,0,0 it>, but I went with <6,0,0 my gut> and couldn't be happier! <7,0,0 The screen> is big and I love that and <8,0,0 it>'s very fast. <9,0,0 The pictures> are super clear and there isn't <10,0,0 a delay> when taking <11,0,0 the pictures>. <12,0,0 It> is loud enough to listen to <13,0,0 music> throughout <14,0,0 the house> and not have to have <15,0,0 it> on <16,0,0 a dock> as well. Very happy with <17,0,0 this phone>.
<0,0,0 It>'s ridiculous how big <1,0,0 this phone> is. <2,0,0 It> is bigger than <3,0,0 the Note 4>. <4,0,0 It> slips easily from <5,0,0 your hands> because of <6,0,0 its body>. <7,0,0 It> is also riddled with <8,0,0 issues>. <9,0,0 My family> bought <10,0,0 this> and had to return <11,0,0 it> the next day because <12,0,0 it> was having <13,0,0 software issues> and <14,0,0 it> was lagging. <15,0,0 It>'s <16,0,0 a fashion phone>. If you actually want to do <17,0,0 more> with <18,0,0 your phone> and be productive, I highly suggest <19,0,0 it>'s <20,0,0 competitor>, <21,0,0 the Note 4>.
<0,0,0 Love my iPhone 6plus>. <1,0,0 It> is a little hard to hold <2,0,0 the phone> in <3,0,0 the right angel> to hear from <4,0,0 the earpiece> at first. I found myself using <5,0,0 my Bluetooth> more often now than I ever have. Other than that <6,0,0 this phone> is just so beautiful. <7,0,0 Picture quality> is great. Watching <8,0,0 a movie> or browsing on <9,0,0 the web>, <10,0,0 photos> and <11,0,0 video> are excellent. <12,0,0 No issue> with texting with <13,0,0 small hands>. <14,0,0 My daughter> has been using <15,0,0 my iPad 2> for <16,0,0 a while> and I have <17,0,0 no need> to use <18,0,0 it> now with <19,0,0 this big screen phone>. <20,0,0 It> has <21,0,0 a very fast processor>, <22,0,0 no regret> at all. Absolutely love <23,0,0 it>.
I currently have <0,0,0 this phone> and <1,0,0 it> works great, <2,0,0 it>'s fast and <3,0,0 the finger print> works great. I have dropped <4,0,0 it> so many times and nothing has happened. I spilled <5,0,0 some water> on <6,0,0 it> and to this day, <7,0,0 it> still works. <8,0,0 It>'s <9,0,0 just a great phone>.
I can't believe <0,0,0 this iPhone> outperformed <1,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7> that <2,0,0 it> is much faster and even <3,0,0 the camera quality> is much clearer and sharper than <4,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7>. <5,0,0 Even the durability> is so much better than <6,0,0 the Samsung><7,0,0 , not> <8,0,0 a crack or scratch>. <9,0,0 The screen> is so much bigger and sharper than <10,0,0 the Samsung>, <11,0,0 the Samsung S7> is <12,0,0 a crappy Windows phone> and <13,0,0 the iPhone> has <14,0,0 more apps>. Even <15,0,0 it> is thinner and lighter. <16,0,0 Even the speaker> has <17,0,0 more bass and much> louder than <18,0,0 the Samsung S7>!
I've used <0,0,0 the Galaxy phones> for years - always hearing <1,0,0 the bad things people> said about <2,0,0 IPhones>. Well, since finally trying out <3,0,0 the iPhone> this year, I have to say I'm <4,0,0 a> convert. I love <5,0,0 this phone>! <6,0,0 It> works with <7,0,0 all the apps> I use for <8,0,0 work>. <9,0,0 Screen> is crisp, clear. <10,0,0 It>'s quick. <11,0,0 Photos and video> is perfect. I will now never buy <12,0,0 any other phone> than <13,0,0 an iPhone>.
I really love <0,0,0 this iPhone SE>. <1,0,0 It> sure is <2,0,0 the same size> as <3,0,0 the iPhone 5s> but <4,0,0 it> has <5,0,0 same features> as <6,0,0 the iPhone 6> and <7,0,0 same speed>. I bought <8,0,0 one> and <9,0,0 it>'s amazing. <10,0,0 It>'s for <11,0,0 an affordable price> and is pretty fast.
<0,0,0 The phone> is great, <1,0,0 it> is very fast and has a lot of <2,0,0 storage>. <3,0,0 It> has <4,0,0 a perfect shape> and <5,0,0 nice looking edges and curves>. <6,0,0 The phone> also has <7,0,0 an innovative fingerprint scanner> <8,0,0 which> is great for <9,0,0 quick unlocking>. <10,0,0 It> also has <11,0,0 a great operating system> and <12,0,0 home screen> has <13,0,0 great virus protection> and will not get <14,0,0 any malware>. <15,0,0 It> has <16,0,0 a nice speaker and camera> takes <17,0,0 great pictures>. <18,0,0 The phone> just looks amazing and <19,0,0 it> is better than <20,0,0 any other phone> <21,0,0 that> I've seen and or used. <22,0,0 It> also has <23,0,0 a bright flashlight>, <24,0,0 the battery> lasts very long and <25,0,0 the battery> usually won't need <26,0,0 replacement>.
I tried <0,0,0 this phone> out <1,0,0 today> and I think <2,0,0 it> is <3,0,0 a great phone>. <4,0,0 It>'s fast like <5,0,0 my iPhone 6s> but smaller, I liked <6,0,0 the iPhone 5s size>. I had <7,0,0 the iPhone 5s> and loved <8,0,0 it> but then updated to <9,0,0 the iPhone 6a>. <10,0,0 The SE> looks just like <11,0,0 the iPhone 5s> but with <12,0,0 more speed>. <13,0,0 The camera> is like <14,0,0 my iPhone 6s>. So if you want to go back to having <15,0,0 a phone> <16,0,0 that> fits in <17,0,0 your pocket>, <18,0,0 this> is <19,0,0 the one>!
I was curious about purchasing <0,0,0 this product> because of <1,0,0 the negative reviews> about <2,0,0 the camera>. But I decided to get <3,0,0 it> for <4,0,0 my girlfriend>, she wanted <5,0,0 a Galaxy S5> at first but <6,0,0 the moment> she got <7,0,0 the M8> she said <8,0,0 it>'s <9,0,0 the best phone> ever. <10,0,0 This phone> attracts <11,0,0 attention> were ever she. Goes I love <12,0,0 this phone>, <13,0,0 it>'s so fast and smooth. We wouldn't mind getting <14,0,0 another>.
I love <0,0,0 my Note 3>, <1,0,0 it>'s bigger than <2,0,0 my S3> but <3,0,0 it>'s not as big as <4,0,0 the mega phone> but <5,0,0 it>'s just right for me, I haven't learned <6,0,0 everything> about <7,0,0 the phone> but I do love <8,0,0 the pen> <9,0,0 that> comes with <10,0,0 the phone>, <11,0,0 it> does a lot. <12,0,0 The camera> is nice and much clearer.
I've had <0,0,0 several phones> throughout <1,0,0 my life> and <2,0,0 the Note 3> is <3,0,0 the best phone> I've had. <4,0,0 Easy> to use as oppose to <5,0,0 some smart phones> <6,0,0 that> are too complicated or <7,0,0 a bunch> of <8,0,0 unusable features>. <9,0,0 It> takes <10,0,0 great pictures>, <11,0,0 the keyboard> is easy to use, and I love <12,0,0 the pre-installed apps> by <13,0,0 Samsung>. <14,0,0 Great phone>!
I love <0,0,0 this phone>. <1,0,0 It> has <2,0,0 a great camera>. I would recommend <3,0,0 it> to anyone. I'm still learning <4,0,0 what> I can do with <5,0,0 this phone>. I like <6,0,0 the S-pen> for taking <7,0,0 quick notes>.
<0,0,0 The best phone> I ever had, I love <1,0,0 it>. I don't use <2,0,0 my iPad> as much anymore. I would recommend <3,0,0 this phone> to <4,0,0 all my friends>.
I'm so impressed with <0,0,0 this phone>. <1,0,0 It> is easy to learn and <2,0,0 it> does so much more than <3,0,0 what> I expected. I would recommend <4,0,0 this> to anyone. <5,0,0 This> is <6,0,0 my first smart phone> and before I was doubtful that I could learn <7,0,0 it>. I looked at <8,0,0 many phones> and <9,0,0 this one> was <10,0,0 the one> for me. I love <11,0,0 the screen>, <12,0,0 the design>, and <13,0,0 easy handling>. Thank you.
<0,0,0 The Note 3> is a lot bigger than <1,0,0 my HTC EVO> but somehow <2,0,0 it>'s lighter. <3,0,0 It>'s very fast and has <4,0,0 so many features> that <5,0,0 an IPhone5> can't touch. I love <6,0,0 the camera features> and <7,0,0 it> takes <8,0,0 great pictures>. <9,0,0 This> is <10,0,0 the best smart phone> on <11,0,0 the market>.
For <0,0,0 the most part>, <1,0,0 it>'s <2,0,0 everything> the other people said. <3,0,0 It>'s <4,0,0 a great phone>, <5,0,0 sound quality> is good and I love <6,0,0 the large screen>. <7,0,0 My only issue> is <8,0,0 the screen> is actually too sensitive. <9,0,0 This> is actually because of <10,0,0 air motion feature>. Even without touching <11,0,0 the screen>, <12,0,0 the phone still 'auto pushes' numbers> while on <13,0,0 the call>. I have to be sure to turn <14,0,0 the keyboard> off <15,0,0 while> on <16,0,0 the call>.
<0,0,0 The Note 3> looks big when <1,0,0 it> is put together with <2,0,0 other phones>, but <3,0,0 it> is fine when I hold <4,0,0 it> in <5,0,0 my hand>. After <6,0,0 a while>, I can even use <7,0,0 one hand> to operate <8,0,0 it>. <9,0,0 It> is so <10,0,0 convenience> to punch <11,0,0 the keypad> and write on <12,0,0 it>. <13,0,0 The resolution> is so high and <14,0,0 images> are so colorful. There are still so <15,0,0 many functions> <16,0,0 that> I need to explore. Due to <17,0,0 the big screen>, I paid <18,0,0 more> to buy <19,0,0 a explosion proof screen protector> but <20,0,0 it> is worth. <21,0,0 Fantastic phone>!
I was <0,0,0 use> to <1,0,0 the Galaxy S series phones> and after <2,0,0 a> while <3,0,0 they> got <4,0,0 slow and laggy> for <5,0,0 no reason>. <6,0,0 The battery life> on <7,0,0 older those S series phones> got worse over time. <8,0,0 This phone> on <9,0,0 the other hand> is still going strong, <10,0,0 it> chargers really fast, and sometimes I can go through the day without <11,0,0 charger> <12,0,0 it> until <13,0,0 night time>.
I had <0,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S3>. <1,0,0 It> worked how I expected <2,0,0 it> to. Then <3,0,0 one> of <4,0,0 my friends> at <5,0,0 work> purchased <6,0,0 the Note 3>. I played with <7,0,0 a few> of <8,0,0 the new features> and told myself get <9,0,0 it>. I haven't regretted <10,0,0 it>. <11,0,0 It>'s not as big as <12,0,0 most people> think. <13,0,0 It>'s just a lot bigger than <14,0,0 most phones>, but fits in <15,0,0 my pockets> with <16,0,0 no problem>.
I really love <0,0,0 this phone>. <1,0,0 The screen> is fantastic, <2,0,0 the design> is slick, <3,0,0 it>'s fast, <4,0,0 it>'s responsive, and <5,0,0 stock Android 5-6 runs> like <6,0,0 a dream>. <7,0,0 The camera> is superb both photo <8,0,0 quality> and <9,0,0 video quality> wise. <10,0,0 Battery life> is pretty good, lasts <11,0,0 about 8 hours> with <12,0,0 active use> and <13,0,0 about 2 days> with <14,0,0 moderate use>, and <15,0,0 it> charges really fast. <16,0,0 Only real drawback> is that <17,0,0 it> has <18,0,0 no SD-card slot>, but <19,0,0 that>'s <20,0,0 ok>. <21,0,0 32GB> is, so far, mostly enough for me. You can connect <22,0,0 a USB flash stick> to <23,0,0 the OTG port> if you must have <24,0,0 more storage> on <25,0,0 the go>, maybe you'd want to get <26,0,0 the 64GB model>. Honestly I would say <27,0,0 this> is better than <28,0,0 an iPhone 6> in <29,0,0 most respects>. <30,0,0 The big screen kind> <31,0,0 of> makes <32,0,0 it> hard (or rather impossible) to handle <33,0,0 it> with <34,0,0 one hand>, in <35,0,0 most cases>, and <36,0,0 it> makes me <37,0,0 a bit> paranoid of dropping <38,0,0 it> when i pull <39,0,0 it> out of <40,0,0 my pocket>. But on <41,0,0 the other hand> I love <42,0,0 the extra screen real-estate>, makes <43,0,0 my sausage fingers> feel right at <44,0,0 home>.
I initially loved <0,0,0 this phone>. <1,0,0 The software and operating system> are great and <2,0,0 it> is fast. However, <3,0,0 the phone> is very slippery and because <4,0,0 it> is so large, <5,0,0 it> slips easily. <6,0,0 This> is <7,0,0 a huge problem> because <8,0,0 the screen shatters> easily. I have owned <9,0,0 many phones> and have been very rough with <10,0,0 them>, yet never have I had <11,0,0 a screen break>. I purchased <12,0,0 a cover> and <13,0,0 protective glass> and yet with <14,0,0 a minor drop> <15,0,0 the glass> shattered.
I upgraded to <0,0,0 this phone> after having <1,0,0 a Galaxy S5> for <2,0,0 about two years>. <3,0,0 The S5> was <4,0,0 a great phone>, but I got frustrated with <5,0,0 some stutters and slowdowns> <6,0,0 that> would occur randomly. I purchased <7,0,0 the Nexus 6> since <8,0,0 it> has <9,0,0 stock Android> and does not have <10,0,0 any overlays> <11,0,0 that> would slow <12,0,0 it> down. After having <13,0,0 the phone> for <14,0,0 about 3 months>, I can say that I am very impressed. <15,0,0 The phone> consistently performs well, <16,0,0 the battery life> lasts me over a day with <17,0,0 moderate use>, and <18,0,0 the fast charging> has come in <19,0,0 handy more> than once when I am low on <20,0,0 battery>. I would highly recommend <21,0,0 this phone> to anyone looking for <22,0,0 a phone> at <23,0,0 a reasonable price point> with <24,0,0 great, even performance>.
<0,0,0 Bought this> during black Friday to replace <1,0,0 my aging S4>. <2,0,0 Everything> about <3,0,0 it> is better than <4,0,0 the S4> except <5,0,0 video recording>. <6,0,0 The Nexus 6> has <7,0,0 a horrible video camera>. <8,0,0 It> cannot focus on moving <9,0,0 objects>. I like to take <10,0,0 videos> for <11,0,0 Instagram> and <12,0,0 this phone> is <13,0,0 absolute trash> when <14,0,0 it> comes to <15,0,0 videos>. <16,0,0 It> constantly tries to focus and <17,0,0 this> leads to <18,0,0 blurry videos>. Besides <19,0,0 the video problem>, <20,0,0 the phone> is great. <21,0,0 The phone> has <22,0,0 longer battery life> than <23,0,0 the S4> and also much faster.
I was <0,0,0 a bit> worried that <1,0,0 the phone> would be too big. Honestly, <2,0,0 it> is a bit bigger than <3,0,0 most phones> but I can tell you that <4,0,0 within 5 minutes> I got <5,0,0 use> to <6,0,0 the size> and I absolutely love <7,0,0 my phone>. <8,0,0 The screen> is big enough for <9,0,0 everything> and <10,0,0 the speakers> are awesome. I am happy I made <11,0,0 the decision> to get <12,0,0 this> instead of <13,0,0 the Nexus 5>. I don't think I need <14,0,0 a phone> smaller than <15,0,0 the Nexus 6> right now.
<0,0,0 The Nexus 6> is <1,0,0 an amazing phone>. Completely customizable in <2,0,0 almost every possible way>. Being unlocked, you're not stuck in <3,0,0 a contract> with <4,0,0 any> of <5,0,0 the big carriers>. I originally used <6,0,0 straight talk> but switched to <7,0,0 Google Fi>, <8,0,0 which> is pretty amazing! <9,0,0 The phone> has <10,0,0 a great forward> facing <11,0,0 camera> and <12,0,0 a reasonable self shot camera> as well. <13,0,0 The screen> is large enough to watch <14,0,0 videos> with <15,0,0 friends>. <16,0,0 The only downfall> of <17,0,0 the phone> is that <18,0,0 it> is almost too big. While <19,0,0 the size> is great for <20,0,0 some things>, <21,0,0 it> is <22,0,0 a hindrance> to carry around and near impossible to use <23,0,0 one handed>. I knew <24,0,0 it> would be big before I bought <25,0,0 it>, but I didn't realize exactly how big! I suggest playing with <26,0,0 one> before <27,0,0 purchasing>, but I still recommend <28,0,0 this phone>, I thoroughly enjoy <29,0,0 mine>.
Honestly, I love <0,0,0 the phone> but sometimes <1,0,0 the speaker volume> is very low even when <2,0,0 it>'s turned up. <3,0,0 It> happens even when I am in <4,0,0 a very quiet place>. Also <5,0,0 my battery> does not last for 24 hours, <6,0,0 it> last for <7,0,0 about 6-8 hours>. Otherwise, <8,0,0 it> charges super fast, takes <9,0,0 great pictures> and <10,0,0 overall> is very fast.
After <0,0,0 2 amazing years> with <1,0,0 my Nexus 5>, <2,0,0 it> was utterly destroyed. Lucky for me, <3,0,0 Amazon> had <4,0,0 a great price> on <5,0,0 the Nexus 6>. <6,0,0 It>'s been amazing. <7,0,0 The screen> is huge. Honestly, I like <8,0,0 the size>, <9,0,0 web pages> are <10,0,0 a pleasure> to view, and <11,0,0 use>. I loved <12,0,0 the battery life> on <13,0,0 my previous Nexus>, but <14,0,0 this phone> is amazing. <15,0,0 The screen> is bright. <16,0,0 The phone> feels amazing in <17,0,0 hand>. I don't think you could ever go wrong with <18,0,0 Nexus devices>.
<0,0,0 Nexus 6> is <1,0,0 an awesome phone>! <2,0,0 My previous phone> was <3,0,0 a HTC One>, <4,0,0 which> was rated <5,0,0 the best phone> in <6,0,0 the world> by <7,0,0 Techradar> when I bought <8,0,0 it> in <9,0,0 2013>. So when I dropped <10,0,0 the HTC> and <11,0,0 the screen> cracked, I was looking for <12,0,0 upgrade>. At $299 (from <13,0,0 Amazon)>, <14,0,0 the Nexus 6> seemed to be <15,0,0 a huge downgrade>. But not after a few months of using <16,0,0 it>, I love <17,0,0 this phone>. <18,0,0 It> does <19,0,0 everything> that <20,0,0 a high-end Android smartphone> is supposed to do. <21,0,0 What> <22,0,0 this phone> does better than almost everyone else is: <23,0,0 this guy> has <24,0,0 a huge screen>. A few months with <25,0,0 this phone> and I realized, I have reduced <26,0,0 my tablet usage> a lot. I read <27,0,0 all news> on <28,0,0 the phone>, watch <29,0,0 Youtube> on <30,0,0 the phone> and so on. And <31,0,0 it> is not <32,0,0 one bit> uncomfortable on <33,0,0 my hand>. I think <34,0,0 this phone> is <35,0,0 a bargain>.
I got <0,0,0 this phone> for <1,0,0 my mom> and <2,0,0 it>'s really awesome. <3,0,0 The display quality> is great. <4,0,0 The screen size> is <5,0,0 BIG>. <6,0,0 The battery life> is very good. <7,0,0 No bloatware>--<8,0,0 just Android> in <9,0,0 its pure form>. <10,0,0 HD Audio> Calling on <11,0,0 T-Mobile> works like <12,0,0 a charm>. <13,0,0 Front> facing <14,0,0 camera quality> could be better but at <15,0,0 this price point> <16,0,0 it>'s very acceptable. <17,0,0 Rear facing images> are good but not great when compared to <18,0,0 leading flagships phones>. <19,0,0 Most people> will be very satisfied with <20,0,0 the image quality>. I give <21,0,0 it> <22,0,0 an 7.5> per <23,0,0 10> compared to <24,0,0 an iPhone 6S>.
<0,0,0 Nexus 6> is <1,0,0 an amazing phone> for $250. I wanted to get <2,0,0 the Nexus 6P> but to be honest <3,0,0 the Nexus 6> still does <4,0,0 an amazing job>. Compare to <5,0,0 the price> of <6,0,0 the Nexus 6P>, <7,0,0 this> is <8,0,0 a better deal>. <9,0,0 Fast charging>, <10,0,0 wireless charging>, <11,0,0 great speed>, <12,0,0 amazing display>, <13,0,0 latest OS marshmallow> <14,0,0 6.0.1> and <15,0,0 an ok camera>, you can't go wrong with <16,0,0 this phone>. I guess <17,0,0 the biggest con> is <18,0,0 the cameras>, <19,0,0 rear> is ok but <20,0,0 the front> is just awful.
<0,0,0 This phone> is excellent. I love <1,0,0 the speakers> on <2,0,0 the front>, and <3,0,0 the large screen> is great. I went from <4,0,0 an HTC One M7> to <5,0,0 this phone>, and I was worried about <6,0,0 it> being too big. <7,0,0 It> isn't. <8,0,0 It> fits nicely in <9,0,0 the hand>, and I can slip <10,0,0 it> into <11,0,0 my jeans> without <12,0,0 issue>. <13,0,0 It> is fast and capable, and <14,0,0 the camera> is nice. I also haven't yet received <15,0,0 the Android 6.0 update> for <16,0,0 some reason>, but I'm really picking <17,0,0 nits> here. <18,0,0 This> is <19,0,0 a great phone> at <20,0,0 a great price>, and I highly recommend <21,0,0 it>.
<0,0,0 The Nexus 6> is <1,0,0 a great phone>, but is not for everyone. Firstly, <2,0,0 it> is huge. <3,0,0 This> is <4,0,0 a reason> I wanted <5,0,0 it>, but can be very unwieldy for <6,0,0 most>. Secondly, <7,0,0 it> runs <8,0,0 stock Android 6.0> <9,0,0 Marshmallow>. I enjoy <10,0,0 the clean, simple design> <11,0,0 which> <12,0,0 Google> has created. Many would rather have <13,0,0 the feature rich skins> <14,0,0 which> <15,0,0 non-Nexus devices ship> with. Other than <16,0,0 these possible set backs>, <17,0,0 the Nexus 6> is <18,0,0 a great flagship device>. <19,0,0 It> contains <20,0,0 all> of <21,0,0 the top specs> expected on <22,0,0 a new phone>. <23,0,0 The build quality> was quite premium and <24,0,0 the AMOLED screen> is <25,0,0 a joy> to use. Since <26,0,0 the price> has been dropping recently, <27,0,0 this> is <28,0,0 an exceptional buy>. If you enjoy <29,0,0 stock Android> and <30,0,0 ridiculous screen size>, <31,0,0 this> is <32,0,0 the phone> for you.
