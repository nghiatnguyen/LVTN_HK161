I am very pleased with <0,0,0 <1,0,0 the phone> we received>.  <2,0,0 It> is <3,0,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <4,0,0 <5,0,0 this> for <6,0,0 my wife>>, she took <7,0,0 it> to <8,0,0 the ATT store> where <9,0,0 they> plugged in <10,0,0 a sim card> and set <11,0,0 it> up within 5 minutes.  <12,0,0 <13,0,0 No problems> at <14,0,0 all>.>  <15,0,0 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <16,0,0 our tile floor>. I even like <17,0,0 <18,0,0 some> of <19,0,0 the displays>> better than <20,0,0 <21,0,0 my S4> which is probably associated with <22,0,0 the S3 operating system>>.  <23,0,0 The price> was in <24,0,0 <25,0,0 line> with <26,0,0 other sellers>>. <27,0,0 Breed> shipped <28,0,0 the phone> right away. I had read <29,0,0 <30,0,0 a number> of <31,0,0 <32,0,0 reviews> on <33,0,0 this product>>> advertised elsewhere on <34,0,0 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <35,0,0 a clone> or refurbished <36,0,0 phone> as described by <37,0,0 some other buyers> (even from <38,0,0 the same seller>).  However, I think that <39,0,0 reviews> may get bundled under <40,0,0 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for <41,0,0 sale> by <42,0,0 the specific seller>.  <43,0,0 This ad> was for <44,0,0 <45,0,0 <46,0,0 a new S3 SGH-I747> (<47,0,0 US model>)> <48,0,0 <49,0,0 ATT phone> and <50,0,0 that>> is exactly what we received>.
<0,0,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,0 <2,0,0 one> of <3,0,0 <4,0,0 the best phones> I've ever used>>. I absolutely love <5,0,0 <6,0,0 the phone> and <7,0,0 the photo quality>> <8,0,0 it> has.
I've had <0,0,0 my N8100> for about two years.  Dropped <1,0,0 it> on <2,0,0 <3,0,0 pavement>, <4,0,0 concrete>, <5,0,0 wood floors>, etc.> <6,0,0 at least 30 times> so <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 <9,0,0 a ton> of <10,0,0 scratches>> but <11,0,0 it>'s held up very well.  <12,0,0 <13,0,0 My 2-year> old> has chewed on <14,0,0 it>, licked <15,0,0 it>, smacked <16,0,0 it>, <17,0,0 <18,0,0 etc.> -- <19,0,0 still no problems>>.  <20,0,0 Signal> has been solid, <21,0,0 intuitive usability> is very good.  <22,0,0 My standard battery> was great for the first 20 months (several hours of <23,0,0 <24,0,0 talk time>, a week of <25,0,0 standby>>) and just now is needing <26,0,0 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <27,0,0 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,0,0 <1,0,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <2,0,0 Sprint>> for about 14 months.  After <3,0,0 my phone> got to be about a year <4,0,0 old>, <5,0,0 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <6,0,0 <7,0,0 much care> on <8,0,0 my part>>. I have not dropped <9,0,0 the phone> or done <10,0,0 anything else> to warrant <11,0,0 all the damage>.  <12,0,0 The hinge to flip <13,0,0 open the phone>> has completely broken, first <14,0,0 just one side> broke and pretty soon <15,0,0 the entire thing> broke.  Then just yesterday <16,0,0 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <17,0,0 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <18,0,0 <19,0,0 a new phone> for another 3-4 months> so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get <20,0,0 <21,0,0 a new phone> that will probably just break after a year>.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <22,0,0 This> is <23,0,0 <24,0,0 the first phone> I've had <25,0,0 that> has been so cheaply made>.
I know <0,0,0 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,0,0 this phone> is <2,0,0 <3,0,0 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <4,0,0 my adult life>>. From day one I had <5,0,0 <6,0,0 problems> with <7,0,0 reception>>, with <8,0,0 the volume> and with <9,0,0 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <10,0,0 It> only got worse over <11,0,0 time>. <12,0,0 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <13,0,0 <14,0,0 sunlight> or <15,0,0 even interior light>> brighter than <16,0,0 a 60-watt bulb>. <17,0,0 The photos> are awful. I've had <18,0,0 <19,0,0 the phone> barely a year> and <20,0,0 it> has essentially stopped working now. <21,0,0 It>'ll be a cold day in <22,0,0 hell> before I give <23,0,0 Sony Ericsson> <24,0,0 <25,0,0 any more> of <26,0,0 my money>>.
<0,0,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 an excellent phone>.  <2,0,0 It> has <3,0,0 a very good color screen>, <4,0,0 it> is well designed, <5,0,0 the camera> is pretty good for <6,0,0 a phone>, and <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 numerous features>.  For <9,0,0 example>, if you have <10,0,0 <11,0,0 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <12,0,0 an IR sensor>>, you can transfer <13,0,0 <14,0,0 phone numbers>, <15,0,0 to-do items>, and <16,0,0 more>>.  You can also record <17,0,0 sound>, apply <18,0,0 <19,0,0 <20,0,0 themes> to <21,0,0 your background>>, and <22,0,0 <23,0,0 surf> <24,0,0 the web>>>.  <25,0,0 The phone> has <26,0,0 a very> nicely laid out <27,0,0 <28,0,0 case and menu> that is easy to navigate>.  <29,0,0 It> also has <30,0,0 <31,0,0 a very quality feel> when you hold <32,0,0 it> in <33,0,0 your hand>>.  <34,0,0 <35,0,0 The only very minor problem> with <36,0,0 this phone>> is that <37,0,0 the case> smudges easily.  <38,0,0 Sony> includes <39,0,0 a nice cloth to wipe <40,0,0 it> down with>.  Besides <41,0,0 that>, <42,0,0 this phone> is incredible.  I got <43,0,0 <44,0,0 two> of <45,0,0 them>> under <46,0,0 a family plan> with <47,0,0 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <48,0,0 The price> is ok, so I would give <49,0,0 this phone> <50,0,0 a 5> out of <51,0,0 5>.
<0,0,0 The phone> looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about <1,0,0 it> is <2,0,0 <3,0,0 the ease> of <4,0,0 use>>. I do not have <5,0,0 the time to tinker with <6,0,0 <7,0,0 a gadget> for an hour to find out> how <8,0,0 a particular thing works>>. With <9,0,0 this phone>, <10,0,0 it> is really easy to browse through <11,0,0 the menu> and find out what I am looking for. <12,0,0 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <13,0,0 your PDA> strictly for <14,0,0 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <15,0,0 it> as <16,0,0 the phone> keeps <17,0,0 <18,0,0 track> of <19,0,0 all <20,0,0 your appointments> and <21,0,0 phonebook>>> just fine. <22,0,0 <23,0,0 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also> works fine and if <24,0,0 the device> is on, <25,0,0 any call> is transferred to <26,0,0 the headset> automatically. Overall, <27,0,0 the phone> is <28,0,0 a good purchase> but I am <29,0,0 a little> skeptical about <30,0,0 AT&T service>. From what I have seen, <31,0,0 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <32,0,0 <33,0,0 the customer service> for <34,0,0 any reason>>, expect to be on <35,0,0 <36,0,0 <37,0,0 hold> for <38,0,0 a long time>> - about 10-20 minutes>).
Previous to purchasing <0,0,0 the E105> I was <1,0,0 an S105 owner>.  I loved that <2,0,0 phone>, but I had <3,0,0 my pet> peeves about <4,0,0 it>, <5,0,0 <6,0,0 the keys> being connected on <7,0,0 the keypad>> made <8,0,0 it> difficult to dial at <9,0,0 times> but as long as I wasn't driving <10,0,0 this> wasn't really <11,0,0 an issue>.  Yes <12,0,0 it> was hard to see <13,0,0 <14,0,0 the screen> in <15,0,0 daylight>> but I don't expect to see <16,0,0 <17,0,0 a crystal clear picture> on <18,0,0 a cell phone>>, <19,0,0 they> aren't <20,0,0 mini laptops folks>.  Although <21,0,0 it> was hard to read, <22,0,0 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately I went to <23,0,0 a concert> and lost that <24,0,0 phone> and replaced <25,0,0 it> with <26,0,0 the E105>.  I have <27,0,0 no complaints>, I live in <28,0,0 a basement apartment> and <29,0,0 the S105> wouldn't get <30,0,0 service>, but <31,0,0 the E105> gets <32,0,0 one bar> and picks up <33,0,0 all> <34,0,0 my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <35,0,0 <36,0,0 the caller> on <37,0,0 the other line>> perfectly, <38,0,0 my boyfriend> has <39,0,0 one> as well and I can hear <40,0,0 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <41,0,0 <42,0,0 a room> with <43,0,0 mild background noise>>.  I haven't had <44,0,0 any problems> with <45,0,0 <46,0,0 the screen> going <47,0,0 <48,0,0 black>, only when <49,0,0 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <50,0,0 option>>> from <51,0,0 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <52,0,0 <53,0,0 this phone> up to <54,0,0 date>>, we'll see if <55,0,0 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,0 <1,0,0 love> with <2,0,0 this phone>> because <3,0,0 it> was compact and lightweight.  <4,0,0 That>'s about all I love about <5,0,0 the phone> right now.  <6,0,0 It> has <7,0,0 really bad reception>, not to mention <8,0,0 weird background noises> on <9,0,0 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,0,0 T-Mobile> sent <11,0,0 a replacement> after I told <12,0,0 them> of <13,0,0 the problem>, but <14,0,0 it>'s still <15,0,0 the same>.  I would buy <16,0,0 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,0 the money>.  <18,0,0 <19,0,0 The wallpapers> provided> are not <20,0,0 the best>, and <21,0,0 neither> are <22,0,0 the ringtones>.  Sometimes <23,0,0 there> is <24,0,0 <25,0,0 a delay> for <26,0,0 the screen to show up when you flip for opening <27,0,0 the phone>>>. <28,0,0 The phone> is <29,0,0 a nice organizer> though.  <30,0,0 Alarms> are <31,0,0 <32,0,0 loud> as well as <33,0,0 the ringtones>>.  <34,0,0 Screen> is pretty bright.  <35,0,0 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <36,0,0 That>'s about <37,0,0 <38,0,0 all the good features> of <39,0,0 the phone>>.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy <40,0,0 this phone>.
I've had <0,0,0 the E105> for about 2 weeks now and I must say <1,0,0 it>'s <2,0,0 <3,0,0 one> of <4,0,0 <5,0,0 the best phones> I've owned>>.  <6,0,0 <7,0,0 The> included <8,0,0 ringers>> are truly embarrassing to play in <9,0,0 public>, but <10,0,0 it>'s easy to download <11,0,0 new and free ringtones> with <12,0,0 <13,0,0 the free WAP access> that <14,0,0 T-Mobile> includes>. <15,0,0 The rings> are very loud though, and <16,0,0 the sound quality> is superb... <17,0,0 my ringer> is currently <18,0,0 <19,0,0 a song> with <20,0,0 <21,0,0 the voice> and <22,0,0 all>>>! <23,0,0 The sound quality> is great, but I guess that depends on <24,0,0 your location and service> in <25,0,0 your area>.  <26,0,0 T-Mobile> includes <27,0,0 <28,0,0 free basic WAP> browsing which I use every day on <29,0,0 this phone>, and for the people who can't access <30,0,0 their favorites> in <31,0,0 T-Zones>>... <32,0,0 <33,0,0 all> you have to do> is hold down <34,0,0 the pound button> and <35,0,0 your favorites> will pop up. <36,0,0 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <37,0,0 a call>, playing <38,0,0 games>, or browsing <39,0,0 the web>.  Overall <40,0,0 this> is <41,0,0 an excellent phone>. The people who complain about <42,0,0 this phone> really need to do <43,0,0 their research> before <44,0,0 they> blab. I downloaded <45,0,0 <46,0,0 new games>, <47,0,0 backgrounds>, and <48,0,0 ringtones>> for free.
I just received <0,0,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed.  <1,0,0 It> is much smaller than <2,0,0 it> looks in <3,0,0 the pics> and has <4,0,0 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <5,0,0 a flip phone> and doing <6,0,0 extensive damage>.... nothing to worry about with <7,0,0 this baby>.  <8,0,0 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  <9,0,0 There> aren't <10,0,0 <11,0,0 the best song selections> for <12,0,0 ringtones>>, but <13,0,0 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <14,0,0 <15,0,0 a phone> with <16,0,0 <17,0,0 good reception>, <18,0,0 a stylish look>, and <19,0,0 a colorful screen>>>, <20,0,0 this> is <21,0,0 <22,0,0 the one> for you>. <23,0,0 It> doesn't have <24,0,0 <25,0,0 tons> of <26,0,0 features> like <27,0,0 <28,0,0 some> of <29,0,0 the other Samsung models>>, but who uses <30,0,0 <31,0,0 all> that <32,0,0 crap>> anyway>.  I'm very satisfied!
<0,0,0 This> is <1,0,0 a great phone>, I used <2,0,0 it> with <3,0,0 my Cingular sim> and had <4,0,0 <5,0,0 no problem> with <6,0,0 it>>. I switched to <7,0,0 a prepaid plan> and <8,0,0 it> works great. <9,0,0 The camera> is <10,0,0 <11,0,0 better than some phones> I have seen>. <12,0,0 The 64MB memory stick> is good for <13,0,0 pics and music>. <14,0,0 The bad> is you can't get <15,0,0 it> from <16,0,0 <17,0,0 any carrier> in <18,0,0 the states>>, only online.
After <0,0,0 my Motorola V180> had acted up on me and frozen <1,0,0 all the damn time>, I had to get <2,0,0 a new one> and <3,0,0 the Samsung X495> doesn't disappoint. <4,0,0 <5,0,0 The only bad thing> about <6,0,0 this phone>> is that I can't access <7,0,0 the internet>. <8,0,0 Reception> is great, and <9,0,0 the battery life> is long - <10,0,0 it> charges in two hours which is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have <11,0,0 excellent reception>. <12,0,0 The speaker phone> is superb, not loud, <13,0,0 it> is so clear, but you have to use <14,0,0 it> with <15,0,0 the phone open>. <16,0,0 It> is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. <17,0,0 It>'s <18,0,0 the perfect girl phone>. If you are looking for <19,0,0 <20,0,0 a basic phone> that actually works>, <21,0,0 this> is <22,0,0 <23,0,0 the phone> you have been waiting for>!
I got <0,0,0 this phone> because <1,0,0 the price> was great, and <2,0,0 it> was easy to hold in <3,0,0 my hand>. <4,0,0 This> is <5,0,0 my first cellphone>, and I love <6,0,0 it>! I'd recommend <7,0,0 it> to anyone! <8,0,0 <9,0,0 A must-have> for everyone who is getting <10,0,0 their first cellphone>.> <11,0,0 Easy> to use, but you have to read <12,0,0 the instruction manual> first to learn about <13,0,0 <14,0,0 all> of <15,0,0 its features>>. <16,0,0 <17,0,0 Nice and bright screen> with <18,0,0 <19,0,0 a nice loud ringtone> (that is, if you want to put <20,0,0 it> <21,0,0 the max volume>)>.> I hope you choose <22,0,0 this phone> if you're unsure of which <23,0,0 <24,0,0 Verizon Wireless> <25,0,0 cell phone>> to buy.
I am totally in <0,0,0 love> with <1,0,0 this phone>. <2,0,0 This> is <3,0,0 the first phone> that I could use without worrying if <4,0,0 the signal> is going to drop. <5,0,0 It> is so much more reliable and lighter than <6,0,0 Z500>. You plus <7,0,0 it> when you change <8,0,0 faceplates>, you don't have to worry about <9,0,0 all the dust and faceplate> slipping off. Sure <10,0,0 it> has <11,0,0 a very sensitive camera button> but I find <12,0,0 it> entertaining to see what pictures I have taken by <13,0,0 accident>. <14,0,0 That>'s just me but <15,0,0 oh> well. You can't have <16,0,0 your cake> and eat <17,0,0 it> too.
I really like <0,0,0 this phone>.  <1,0,0 It>'s cute, <2,0,0 it>'s little, <3,0,0 it>'s perfect for <4,0,0 a young woman>.  I had <5,0,0 a Pocket PC> prior to <6,0,0 this> and <7,0,0 it> was so complicated just making <8,0,0 a call>.  I wanted <9,0,0 <10,0,0 <11,0,0 something simple>, that wasn't <12,0,0 <13,0,0 <14,0,0 a mp3 player> (i have <15,0,0 an iPod>)>, that wasn't <16,0,0 <17,0,0 a professional camera> (i have <18,0,0 a nice digital cam>)>>,> or <19,0,0 <20,0,0 a PDA> (i have <21,0,0 a PALM TX>)>> … <22,0,0 it>'s just simple and cute. <23,0,0 It>'s <24,0,0 Bluetooth compatible>... although doesn't work <25,0,0 that great> with <26,0,0 my Bluetooth>, but I'm not sure if <27,0,0 it>'s <28,0,0 <29,0,0 the headset> or <30,0,0 the phone>>. <31,0,0 <32,0,0 The ringer> on <33,0,0 it>> is <34,0,0 super quiet>... almost to <35,0,0 the point> you can barely hear <36,0,0 it> in <37,0,0 your purse>.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for <38,0,0 the> vibrating <39,0,0 feature> instead. I like how you can put <40,0,0 <41,0,0 a person's> picture> next to <42,0,0 <43,0,0 their name> in <44,0,0 your contact list>>. I can wear <45,0,0 it> in <46,0,0 <47,0,0 the back pocket> of <48,0,0 my jeans>> and <49,0,0 it>'s comfortable. <50,0,0 Sound quality> is good, on <51,0,0 <52,0,0 both ends> I dig <53,0,0 it>>.  I'm sure you will too.
Ok, I have had <0,0,0 <1,0,0 Verizon> for less than two years> and <2,0,0 this> is <3,0,0 my third phone>.  <4,0,0 It> is fairly new so I have <5,0,0 no complaints> as of yet.  <6,0,0 The reception> is <7,0,0 a lot> clearer than <8,0,0 the last one> I had.  <9,0,0 <10,0,0 The fact> that <11,0,0 it> has <12,0,0 a camera>> is even greater.  I love taking <13,0,0 pictures> so <14,0,0 this> was perfect for me.  <15,0,0 The picture quality> isn't <16,0,0 the best>, but for <17,0,0 a camera phone> <18,0,0 it> is pretty good compared to <19,0,0 <20,0,0 the others> I have seen>. <21,0,0 <22,0,0 The buttons> of <23,0,0 the phone>> are larger than <24,0,0 some> so I don't have <25,0,0 <26,0,0 trouble> hitting <27,0,0 the wrong buttons>>.  I haven't had <28,0,0 any difficulty> with <29,0,0 <30,0,0 the battery> at all>, in <31,0,0 <32,0,0 fact> <33,0,0 the battery> seems to <34,0,0 <35,0,0 last> quite <36,0,0 a bit> longer than <37,0,0 the last two phones> I had>>.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with <38,0,0 this phone>.
I got <0,0,0 my phone> a few days ago and <1,0,0 it> is way better than <2,0,0 the other one> I had.  I do have to say that <3,0,0 the features> are awesome!  <4,0,0 They> are easier to use than <5,0,0 my old phone>. <6,0,0 The camera> is easy as <7,0,0 pie> to use.  <8,0,0 It> has <9,0,0 <10,0,0 a lot> of <11,0,0 memory>>. On <12,0,0 the screen> you can put <13,0,0 pictures> that you take with <14,0,0 the camera option>. Or you can download <15,0,0 <16,0,0 wallpapers> for <17,0,0 your background>>.  <18,0,0 It> is such <19,0,0 a nice phone>. You can store <20,0,0 <21,0,0 a lot> of <22,0,0 <23,0,0 contacts> in <24,0,0 the contacts list>>>. Basically I would recommend <25,0,0 <26,0,0 this phone> for anyone>.
I upgraded <0,0,0 my phone> two months ago from <1,0,0 a Motorola V300> to <2,0,0 this model> because I wanted <3,0,0 <4,0,0 a radio> and <5,0,0 a larger keypad>>. After <6,0,0 one> month, <7,0,0 the radio> no longer worked, <8,0,0 the battery> dies when <9,0,0 it> claims to be fully charged, <10,0,0 it> takes <11,0,0 three> tries to get <12,0,0 it> to connect when making <13,0,0 <14,0,0 a call>, and sometimes <15,0,0 the phone>> <16,0,0 just freaks> out and resets <17,0,0 itself> while you're in <18,0,0 <19,0,0 the middle> of <20,0,0 texting>> or surfing <21,0,0 the web>. <22,0,0 It>'s flimsy. I've had <23,0,0 <24,0,0 my V300> for two years> and <25,0,0 everything> still works on <26,0,0 it>. <27,0,0 The Nokia 6101> has <28,0,0 <29,0,0 a lot> of <30,0,0 issues>>.
I have owned <0,0,0 the Nokia 6101> since late October 2005. I absolutely love <1,0,0 it>! I wouldn't trade <2,0,0 it> for <3,0,0 the world>. <4,0,0 My boyfriend> even wanted me to trade <5,0,0 it> <6,0,0 tom> get <7,0,0 <8,0,0 a Motorola Razr V3> like he has, which does have <9,0,0 <10,0,0 its own set> of <11,0,0 great perks>>>, but I love <12,0,0 my phone>. <13,0,0 There> are <14,0,0 <15,0,0 a few games> on <16,0,0 there> (with <17,0,0 room to download>)>, <18,0,0 the camera quality> has <19,0,0 great clarity>, <20,0,0 the FM radio> works perfectly (and is <21,0,0 <22,0,0 a great passer> of <23,0,0 time>>), and <24,0,0 it> has <25,0,0 <26,0,0 great reception> on <27,0,0 <28,0,0 T-Mobile's> GSM network>>. You can also use <29,0,0 the recorder to record <30,0,0 your own ringtones>>. <31,0,0 It>'s great!
I recently purchased <0,0,0 this phone> and <1,0,0 it> is so much better than <2,0,0 the last one> I had! <3,0,0 <4,0,0 The only problem> I've had> so far is that <5,0,0 it> froze up once which can be fixed only by putting <6,0,0 the battery> back in.
<0,0,0 This phone> is awesome and has <1,0,0 great features>! I have had <2,0,0 it> for a year and <3,0,0 it> hasn't given me <4,0,0 a problem> once! <5,0,0 The ringtones> are awesome! <6,0,0 The camera quality> is great and <7,0,0 it> has <8,0,0 <9,0,0 cool games> that are <10,0,0 <11,0,0 fun> that you can order>>. <12,0,0 This phone> really lets you show <13,0,0 your style> with <14,0,0 <15,0,0 <16,0,0 features> that let you pick <17,0,0 your phone colors>> and <18,0,0 <19,0,0 online shopping> for <20,0,0 ringtones and wallpaper>>>! <21,0,0 It> lets you adjust <22,0,0 the phone volume and ringtone volume> to <23,0,0 your liking> and <24,0,0 <25,0,0 the T-zones> online <26,0,0 shop>> has <27,0,0 <28,0,0 <29,0,0 all the best artists> and <30,0,0 <31,0,0 songs> that gets <32,0,0 everyone dancing>, like <33,0,0 Rihanna, Chamillionare>>> and <34,0,0 a lot> more>! So, if you want <35,0,0 <36,0,0 a reliable phone> that lets you personalize and just be you, with <37,0,0 <38,0,0 so many cheap plans> to choose from>>, <39,0,0 then you> should get <40,0,0 the Nokia 6101 Phone> (which is <41,0,0 <42,0,0 T-Mobile> of <43,0,0 course>>!) because <44,0,0 it>'s <45,0,0 the best>!
<0,0,0 This phone> is excellent.  <1,0,0 <2,0,0 The best> I've had as far as <3,0,0 reliability and signal>> - may be partly because of <4,0,0 Cingular>, too.  <5,0,0 The buttons> are <6,0,0 a little> hard to get used to, but <7,0,0 it> doesn't take long.  <8,0,0 The screen> is clear and easy to read, <9,0,0 the battery> stays charged for <10,0,0 <11,0,0 a good amount> of <12,0,0 time> (especially if you don't use <13,0,0 it> to call anyone)>, and <14,0,0 it>'s just <15,0,0 an overall good phone>.  I totally recommend <16,0,0 it>.
I've owned <0,0,0 <1,0,0 a 6101> for 2 years> and never had <2,0,0 <3,0,0 a problem> even dropped <4,0,0 it> once or twice and still worked great>. <5,0,0 <6,0,0 The only reason> I'll purchase <7,0,0 another>> is because <8,0,0 they> will not withstand <9,0,0 a 250lbs person> accidentally falling on <10,0,0 it> other than that I enjoyed <11,0,0 the phone>.
<0,0,0 My Nokia 3220 phone> is <1,0,0 <2,0,0 a huge letdown> in <3,0,0 functionality>>.  First, I bought <4,0,0 it> for <5,0,0 the camera>.  <6,0,0 The camera> does not allow me to send <7,0,0 pictures>.  Or <8,0,0 <9,0,0 my settings>, that came with <10,0,0 the phone>> are not sufficient.  <11,0,0 This> is <12,0,0 <13,0,0 one> of <14,0,0 the best reasons> to have <15,0,0 a camera phone>>. <16,0,0 <17,0,0 The 2nd unique feature> that I was so excited about> was <18,0,0 the FM radio function>.  <19,0,0 My phone> does not have <20,0,0 that capability> either.  Even after sending <21,0,0 one> back and receiving <22,0,0 <23,0,0 <24,0,0 a brand new phone> (<25,0,0 <26,0,0 exact model> as <27,0,0 first>>)>, <28,0,0 no FM function>>.  Now I don't have <29,0,0 <30,0,0 options> but to contact <31,0,0 Nokia> direct>, which I don't think I should have to do with <32,0,0 a brand new phone>.  So I am not impressed with <33,0,0 this model> and do not recommend <34,0,0 it>.  I was <35,0,0 a huge Nokia fan> until <36,0,0 this phone>.
I have owned <0,0,0 the phone> for about 6 months now.  I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and receive about <1,0,0 <2,0,0 20 emails> a day>.  <3,0,0 The phone> has <4,0,0 <5,0,0 a bunch> of <6,0,0 great capabilities>> and is occasionally <7,0,0 a great work companion>.  <8,0,0 The wide screen> is excellent for <9,0,0 viewing>.  <10,0,0 The CPU functions> work <11,0,0 a little> slow which could be expected from <12,0,0 such a small package>.  <13,0,0 The frustrating part> is <14,0,0 the phone> frequently works slow as well.  <15,0,0 <16,0,0 <17,0,0 About once> a week> <18,0,0 it> is necessary to take out <19,0,0 the battery> and let <20,0,0 it> sit for a minute before turning <21,0,0 the phone> on.>  <22,0,0 The phone> takes a couple minutes to turn on.  Overall, <23,0,0 it> seems slow and unstable which overshadows <24,0,0 <25,0,0 all> of <26,0,0 its great features>>.  Reminds me of <27,0,0 Windows 98>.
<0,0,0 My LG C1300> is <1,0,0 <2,0,0 a really small, clamshell phone> with <3,0,0 <4,0,0 a part> that looks like <5,0,0 <6,0,0 a mirror> on <7,0,0 top>>>>. <8,0,0 It> includes <9,0,0 <10,0,0 most basic features> including <11,0,0 <12,0,0 text messaging>, <13,0,0 <14,0,0 <15,0,0 multimedia> messaging>, <16,0,0 media mall>, and <17,0,0 <18,0,0 everything> you need to download <19,0,0 <20,0,0 wallpaper>, <21,0,0 games>, <22,0,0 ringtones>, and <23,0,0 <24,0,0 applications> straight from <25,0,0 Cingular>>>>>>>. <26,0,0 It> has <27,0,0 an awesome battery life>, but you can't always trust <28,0,0 the battery monitor>... sometimes <29,0,0 it> will display <30,0,0 one bar> left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call <31,0,0 quality> has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have <32,0,0 bad reception>... but <33,0,0 that> is <34,0,0 <35,0,0 the network>, not <36,0,0 the phone>>. Overall, I love <37,0,0 my LG C1300> although now I wish I might have had <38,0,0 a camera phone>, but <39,0,0 this phone> is awesome for <40,0,0 <41,0,0 all the features> and <42,0,0 <43,0,0 the minimal price> involved>>.
<0,0,0 This> was <1,0,0 <2,0,0 my first cell phone> in a few years>, <3,0,0 my first> was <4,0,0 the Bulky bag phones>. I now own <5,0,0 a Sony Ericsson Z500a> and have had <6,0,0 good luck> so far despite <7,0,0 the horrible reviews>. As for <8,0,0 this phone>, I liked <9,0,0 <10,0,0 the design and ease> of <11,0,0 <12,0,0 use> much better than <13,0,0 my new> <14,0,0 one>>>. I even dropped <15,0,0 it> in <16,0,0 the toilet> and after a week of <17,0,0 dry out worked fine>. <18,0,0 <19,0,0 The only thing> I realize now> is that <20,0,0 the signal strength> wasn't that great. <21,0,0 <22,0,0 My wife> and I> both had <23,0,0 <24,0,0 these phones> and now she has <25,0,0 a Nokia 6010> and <26,0,0 <27,0,0 both> of <28,0,0 our new phones>> have <29,0,0 <30,0,0 better signal strength> and <31,0,0 clearer call reception>> than <32,0,0 the LG> did>. But I absolutely loved how <33,0,0 the LG 1300 phone> was set up <34,0,0 more> than <35,0,0 <36,0,0 either> of <37,0,0 our new ones>>.
<0,0,0 The RAZR> is <1,0,0 a very durable and reliable phone>.  Contrary to <2,0,0 other reviews>, I have dropped <3,0,0 my phone> several times and <4,0,0 it> keeps on ticking!  <5,0,0 My wife> has <6,0,0 the pink RAZR> and I have <7,0,0 the black RAZR> and <8,0,0 <9,0,0 both> of us> are extremely pleased.  <10,0,0 This> is by <11,0,0 <12,0,0 far the best phone> on <13,0,0 the market>>.  <14,0,0 It> separates <15,0,0 itself> from <16,0,0 all <17,0,0 the other plastic> and <18,0,0 cheap phones>>.
Have tried <0,0,0 <1,0,0 lots> of <2,0,0 <3,0,0 phones> and <4,0,0 the RAZR>>> is <5,0,0 <6,0,0 the best> I've had>. <7,0,0 <8,0,0 <9,0,0 Not only> for <10,0,0 the color>>, but also <11,0,0 the slim profile>> allows me to put <12,0,0 it> in <13,0,0 my back pocket> and never miss <14,0,0 a call> like I did when <15,0,0 my old Bulky phone> was in <16,0,0 my purse>. <17,0,0 Sound quality> is better than <18,0,0 my last Nokia 6600>, on both <19,0,0 the receiving and talking end>. People say <20,0,0 they> can hear me better now. Highly recommend for <21,0,0 function and style>. <22,0,0 <23,0,0 No downsides> to <24,0,0 <25,0,0 this phone> that I can see yet, as of 2 months of <26,0,0 use>>.>
Had <0,0,0 the Motorola Razor> and <1,0,0 it> got damaged so I decided to try <2,0,0 this PEBL>. With <3,0,0 the Razor> you can use <4,0,0 a Bluetooth ear piece> and just push <5,0,0 one button> and say <6,0,0 <7,0,0 only the name> of who you are calling>. <8,0,0 This feature> I use <9,0,0 all the time> due to <10,0,0 my hands> being dirty at <11,0,0 work>. With <12,0,0 this stupid PEBL> you have to say <13,0,0 all this junk> like <14,0,0 <15,0,0 name dial or digit dial> then> finally <16,0,0 <17,0,0 the person’s> name>. <18,0,0 All these extra voice commands> are not cool. <19,0,0 The PEBL> does not ever recognize what you are saying through <20,0,0 your compatible earpiece> and if <21,0,0 it> does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped <22,0,0 <23,0,0 this phone> only <24,0,0 one time> from out of <25,0,0 a faulty case>> on <26,0,0 my waist>! <27,0,0 <28,0,0 It> sure <29,0,0 dents and scratches>> easy! I will not be using <30,0,0 Motorolas> anymore, I think <31,0,0 they> are bad for me.
I bought <0,0,0 the L7 SLVR> last month from <1,0,0 Amazon> and <2,0,0 it> came in as advertise.  <3,0,0 This phone> is not bad.  Looks <4,0,0 real smooth> in <5,0,0 <6,0,0 black>, easy to use> and <7,0,0 its sound> is really clear.  <8,0,0 The battery life> is not bad as well.  I haven't charged <9,0,0 it> in 3 days with <10,0,0 moderate usage> and <11,0,0 it> still has <12,0,0 one bar> up.  <13,0,0 <14,0,0 One thing> I would suggest> is buying <15,0,0 <16,0,0 a case> for <17,0,0 it>> because <18,0,0 it>'s easy to smudge <19,0,0 fingerprints> on <20,0,0 the screen>.  So far <21,0,0 the phone> is fine.  If you're looking for <22,0,0 <23,0,0 a basic phone> with <24,0,0 so-so bells and whistles>>, <25,0,0 this> would not be <26,0,0 a bad choice>.
I ordered <0,0,0 Nokia 5800> from <1,0,0 Bigtime Wireless> and <2,0,0 it> came fast <3,0,0 all the way> to <4,0,0 Nepal> and <5,0,0 the phone> works great. <6,0,0 The Nokia 5800> has <7,0,0 great features> and I highly recommend <8,0,0 <9,0,0 the phone> and <10,0,0 the seller>>. I am buying <11,0,0 another one> soon from <12,0,0 Bigtime Wireless>.
Okay. <0,0,0 The actual phone> is awesome. I love <1,0,0 all the features>, <2,0,0 it>'s small, <3,0,0 it>'s pretty. <4,0,0 The phone> is good. <5,0,0 The service> sucks. When I bought <6,0,0 the phone>, <7,0,0 it> said <8,0,0 service> is available in <9,0,0 my area>. Not so. I have walked all over <10,0,0 this town> and cannot send or receive <11,0,0 calls and texts> ANYWHERE. I have been wrestling for <12,0,0 <13,0,0 customer service> for days> now. Unless you live in <14,0,0 a huge city> with <15,0,0 <16,0,0 a lot> of <17,0,0 cell phone towers>>, do not get <18,0,0 this phone>. <19,0,0 It> won't work for you.
We purchased <0,0,0 <1,0,0 A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone> for <2,0,0 a trip>> to <3,0,0 Turkey and Greece>. <4,0,0 The phone> did not work in <5,0,0 Turkey> but <6,0,0 it> did in <7,0,0 Greece>, so I believe <8,0,0 it> was <9,0,0 <10,0,0 the service> and not <11,0,0 the phone>>. <12,0,0 My complaint> is <13,0,0 the camera>. After documenting <14,0,0 our trip> with <15,0,0 the camera>, we now find we unable to download <16,0,0 the pictures> without purchasing, at <17,0,0 <18,0,0 additional cost>, <19,0,0 software> and <20,0,0 USB cable>> from <21,0,0 Motorola>. Ridiculous!
I've had <0,0,0 <1,0,0 this phone> for 2 years>. I've dropped <2,0,0 it> several times and <3,0,0 it> still works. <4,0,0 It>'s sturdy. <5,0,0 The design> is awesome. I like how small <6,0,0 it> is. <7,0,0 They> don't make <8,0,0 small phones> like <9,0,0 this> anymore. I wish <10,0,0 they> still made <11,0,0 this phone>. I would buy <12,0,0 another>. After a couple years, I find I need to replace <13,0,0 the battery> or I may upgrade to <14,0,0 something else>. Otherwise, <15,0,0 this phone> has been with me for <16,0,0 a long time> and still works!
I had <0,0,0 <1,0,0 low expectations> about <2,0,0 this phone>>, but when I opened <3,0,0 it> for <4,0,0 the first time> I knew <5,0,0 it> was tend to be mine. I could not want <6,0,0 any other phone> than <7,0,0 this one>. <8,0,0 It> has <9,0,0 <10,0,0 all the features> I want and <11,0,0 its> very cool, modern> and at <12,0,0 a very good price>.
I ordered <0,0,0 the phone> last week, and <1,0,0 it> came this morning. I was very happy for <2,0,0 the fast delivery>. However, when I opened <3,0,0 the box>, <4,0,0 it> looked really cheap to me. <5,0,0 The phone> was in <6,0,0 an old package>. <7,0,0 Even the phone> looked old, and <8,0,0 there>'re <9,0,0 <10,0,0 scratches> on <11,0,0 it>>. Inside <12,0,0 the package>, <13,0,0 there>'re only <14,0,0 <15,0,0 a phone>, <16,0,0 a battery>, <17,0,0 a back cover>, <18,0,0 a charger> and <19,0,0 an old Cingular manual>>. <20,0,0 The phone> looked like <21,0,0 <22,0,0 a refurbished one> because <23,0,0 <24,0,0 the tiny screws> on <25,0,0 the back>> was loose>. I had to use <26,0,0 the screwdriver to fix <27,0,0 them>>. <28,0,0 It> cost $145 plus <29,0,0 tax> last week, and <30,0,0 it> dropped down to $139 plus <31,0,0 tax> this week. So I already got $6 lost!
<0,0,0 The Nokia 2610> is <1,0,0 a great basic phone>. If you need <2,0,0 <3,0,0 a phone> that is easy to use>, <4,0,0 this> is <5,0,0 <6,0,0 the one> for you>. <7,0,0 <8,0,0 Call quality> and <9,0,0 reception>> are great. <10,0,0 The phone> is straight forward and <11,0,0 very user> friendly.
<0,0,0 The phone> is gorgeous, and <1,0,0 the buttons> are easy to <2,0,0 type> on. <3,0,0 <4,0,0 The only downside> of <5,0,0 this device>> is <6,0,0 the Windows software>. <7,0,0 It> sort of reminds me of <8,0,0 Windows 1998> - <9,0,0 limited error messages> and <10,0,0 <11,0,0 a very buggy version> of <12,0,0 Internet Explorer>>.
