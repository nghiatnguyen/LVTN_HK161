I am very pleased with <0,-1,0 <1,0,0 the phone> we received>.  <2,1,0 It> is <3,2,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <4,3,0 <5,4,0 this> for <6,0,1 my wife>>, she took <7,5,0 it> to <8,0,1 the ATT store> where <9,0,1 they> plugged in <10,-1,0 a sim card> and set <11,7,0 it> up within <12,0,1 5 minutes>.  <13,0,1 <14,0,1 No problems> at <15,0,1 all>.>  <16,11,0 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <17,0,1 our tile floor>. I even like <18,-1,0 <19,0,1 some> of <20,18,0 the displays>> better than <21,-1,0 <22,21,0 my S4> which is probably associated with <23,-1,0 the S3 operating system>>.  <24,-1,0 The price> was in <25,0,1 <26,0,1 line> with <27,0,1 other sellers>>. <28,0,1 Breed> shipped <29,16,0 the phone> right away. I had read <30,0,1 <31,0,1 a number> of <32,0,1 <33,0,1 reviews> on <34,29,0 this product>>> advertised elsewhere on <35,0,1 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <36,0,1 a clone> or refurbished <37,34,0 phone> as described by <38,0,1 some other buyers> (even from <39,0,1 the same seller>).  However, I think that <40,0,1 reviews> may get bundled under <41,-1,0 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for <42,0,1 sale> by <43,0,1 the specific seller>.  <44,0,1 This ad> was for <45,-1,0 <46,-1,0 <47,46,0 a new S3 SGH-I747> (<48,0,1 US model>)> <49,0,1 <50,-1,0 ATT phone> and <51,0,1 that>> is exactly what we received>.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,0 <2,0,1 one> of <3,-1,0 <4,-1,0 the best phones> I've ever used>>. I absolutely love <5,0,1 <6,1,0 the phone> and <7,-1,0 the photo quality>> <8,6,0 it> has.
I've had <0,-1,0 <1,0,1 my <2,0,0 8100> for> about <3,0,1 two years>>.  Dropped <4,2,0 it> on <5,0,1 <6,0,1 pavement>, <7,0,1 concrete>, <8,0,1 wood floors>, etc.> <9,0,1 at least 30 times> so <10,4,0 it> has <11,0,1 <12,0,1 a ton> of <13,0,1 scratches>> but <14,10,0 it>'s held up very well.  <15,0,1 <16,0,1 My 2-year> old> has chewed on <17,14,0 it>, licked <18,17,0 it>, smacked <19,18,0 it>, <20,0,1 <21,0,1 etc.> -- <22,0,1 still no problems>>.  <23,-1,0 Signal> has been solid, <24,-1,0 intuitive usability> is very good.  <25,-1,0 My standard battery> was great for <26,0,1 <27,0,1 the first 20 months> (<28,0,1 <29,0,1 several hours> of <30,0,1 <31,0,1 talk time>, <32,0,1 <33,0,1 a week> of <34,0,1 standby>>>>)> and just now is needing <35,-1,0 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <36,-1,0 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,-1,0 <1,0,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <2,-1,0 Sprint>> for <3,0,1 about 14 months>.  After <4,1,0 my phone> got to be about <5,0,1 <6,0,1 a year> <7,0,1 old>>, <8,4,0 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <9,0,1 <10,0,1 much care> on <11,0,1 my part>>. I have not dropped <12,8,0 the phone> or done <13,0,1 anything else> to warrant <14,0,1 all the damage>.  <15,-1,0 The hinge to flip open <16,12,0 the phone> has completely broken -first <17,-1,0 just one side>> broke and pretty soon <18,-1,0 the entire thing> broke.  Then just yesterday <19,-1,0 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <20,2,1 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <21,-1,0 <22,21,0 a new phone> for <23,0,1 another 3-4 months>> so now I am going to be forced to spend about <24,0,1 $200 just> to get <25,-1,0 <26,25,0 a new phone> that will probably just break after <27,0,1 a year>>.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <28,16,0 This> is <29,28,0 <30,-1,0 the first phone> I've had <31,29,0 that> has been so cheaply made>.
I know <0,0,1 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,-1,0 this phone> is <2,1,0 <3,-1,0 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <4,0,1 my adult life>>. From <5,0,1 day one> I had <6,0,1 <7,0,1 problems> with <8,-1,0 reception>>, with <9,-1,0 the volume> and with <10,-1,0 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <11,2,0 It> only got worse over <12,0,1 time>. <13,-1,0 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <14,0,1 <15,0,1 sunlight> or <16,0,1 even interior light>> brighter than <17,0,1 a 60-watt bulb>. <18,-1,0 The photos> are awful. I've had <19,11,1 <20,19,0 the phone> barely a year> and <21,20,0 it> has essentially stopped working now. <22,0,1 It>'ll be <23,0,1 <24,0,1 a cold day> in <25,0,1 hell>> before I give <26,-1,0 Sony Ericsson> <27,0,1 <28,0,1 any more> of <29,0,1 my money>>.
<0,-1,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 an excellent phone>.  <2,1,0 It> has <3,-1,0 a very good color screen>, <4,2,0 it> is well disigned, <5,-1,0 the camera> is pretty good for <6,4,0 a phone>, and <7,6,0 it> has <8,-1,0 numerous features>.  For <9,0,1 example>, if you have <10,0,1 <11,-1,0 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <12,-1,0 an IR sensor>>, you can transfer <13,0,1 <14,0,1 phone numbers>, <15,0,1 to-do items>, and <16,0,1 more>>.  You can also record <17,-1,1 sound>, apply <18,-1,0 themes> to you <19,-1,0 background>, and <20,0,1 <21,0,1 surf> <22,-1,0 the web>>.  <23,7,0 The phone> has <24,0,1 a very> nicely laid out <25,-1,0 <26,25,0 case and menu> that is easy to navigate>.  <27,0,1 It> also has <28,0,1 <29,0,1 a very quality feel> when you hold <30,23,0 it> in <31,0,1 your hand>>.  <32,0,1 <33,0,1 The only very minor problem> with <34,30,0 this phone>> is that <35,-1,0 the case> smudges easily.  <36,-1,0 Sony> includes <37,0,1 a nice cloth to wipe <38,35,0 it> down with>.  Besides <39,0,1 that>, <40,38,0 this phone> is incredible.  I got <41,38,0 <42,0,1 two> of <43,41,0 them>> under <44,0,1 a family plan> with <45,-1,0 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <46,-1,0 The price> is ok, so I would give <47,43,0 this phone> <48,0,1 a 5> out of <49,0,1 5>.
<0,-1,0 The phone> looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about <1,0,0 it> is <2,-1,0 <3,0,1 the ease> of <4,2,0 use>>. I do not have <5,0,1 the time to tinker with <6,-1,0 <7,6,0 a gadget> for <8,0,1 an hour to find out>> how <9,0,1 a particular thing works>>. With <10,1,0 this phone>, <11,0,1 it> is really easy to browse through <12,-1,0 the menu> and find out what I am looking for. <13,-1,0 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <14,-1,0 your PDA> strictly for <15,0,1 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <16,14,0 it> as <17,10,0 the phone> keeps <18,0,1 <19,0,1 track> of <20,0,1 all <21,0,1 your appointments> and <22,0,1 phonebook>>> just fine. <23,0,1 <24,-1,0 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also works fine and if <25,17,0 the device> is on <26,0,1 any call>> is transferred to <27,24,0 the headset> automatically. Overall, <28,25,0 the phone> is <29,28,0 a good purchase> but I am <30,0,1 a little> skeptical about <31,-1,0 AT&T service>. From what I have seen, <32,-1,0 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <33,-1,0 <34,33,0 the customer service> for <35,0,1 any reason>>, expect to be on <36,0,1 <37,0,1 <38,0,1 hold> for <39,0,1 a long time>> - about <40,0,1 10-20 minutes>>).
Previous to purchasing <0,-1,0 the e105> I was <1,0,1 an s105 owner>.  I loved that <2,0,1 <3,-1,0 phone> but I> had <4,0,1 my pet> peeves about <5,3,0 it>, <6,0,0 <7,-1,0 the keys> being connected on <8,-1,0 the keypad>> made <9,5,0 it> difficult to dial at <10,0,1 times> but as long as I wasn't driving <11,0,1 this> wasn't really <12,0,1 an issue>.  Yes <13,0,1 it> was hard to see <14,-1,0 <15,0,1 the screen> in <16,0,1 daylight>> but I don't expect to see <17,-1,0 <18,0,1 a crystal clear picture> on <19,-1,0 a cell phone>>, <20,19,0 they> aren't <21,0,0 mini laptops folks>.  Although <22,0,1 it> was hard to read, <23,0,1 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately I went to <24,0,1 a concert> and lost that <25,9,0 phone> and replaced <26,25,0 it> with <27,0,0 the e105>.  I have <28,0,1 no complaints>, I live in <29,0,1 a basement apartment> and <30,26,0 the s105> wouldn't get <31,0,1 service>, but <32,27,0 the e105> gets <33,0,1 one bar> and picks up <34,0,1 all> <35,0,1 my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <36,0,1 <37,0,1 the caller> on <38,0,1 the other line>> perfectly, <39,0,1 my boyfriend> has <40,32,0 one> as well and I can hear <41,0,1 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <42,0,1 <43,0,1 a room> with <44,0,1 mild background noise>>.  I haven't had <45,0,1 any problems> with <46,0,1 <47,-1,0 the screen> going <48,0,1 <49,0,1 black>, only when <50,40,0 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <51,0,1 option>>> from <52,-1,0 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <53,0,1 <54,50,0 this phone> up to <55,0,1 date>>, we'll see if <56,54,0 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,1 <1,0,1 love> with <2,-1,0 this phone>> because <3,2,0 it> was compact and lightweight.  <4,0,1 That>'s about all I love about <5,3,0 the phone> right now.  <6,5,0 It> has <7,-1,0 really bad reception>, not to mention <8,-1,0 weird background noises> on <9,0,1 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,-1,0 T-Mobile> sent <11,-1,0 a replacement> after I told <12,10,0 them> of <13,0,1 the problem>, but <14,11,0 it>'s still <15,0,1 the same>.  I would buy <16,-1,0 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,1 the money>.  <18,0,1 <19,-1,0 The wallpapers> provided> are not <20,0,1 the best>, and <21,0,1 neither> are <22,-1,0 the ringtones>.  Sometimes <23,0,1 there> is <24,0,1 <25,0,1 a delay> for <26,-1,0 the screen to show up when you flip <27,6,0 open the phone>>>. <28,27,0 The phone> is <29,28,0 a nice organizer> though.  <30,-1,0 Alarms> are <31,0,1 <32,0,1 loud> as well as <33,22,0 the ringtones>>.  <34,26,0 Screen> is pretty bright.  <35,-1,0 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <36,0,1 That>'s about <37,0,1 <38,0,1 all the good features> of <39,29,0 the phone>>.  Personally, I would not recommend <40,0,1 anyone> to buy <41,39,0 this phone>.
I've had <0,-1,0 the e105> for about <1,0,1 2 weeks> now and I must say <2,0,0 it>'s <3,2,0 <4,0,1 one> of <5,-1,0 <6,-1,0 the best phones> I've owned>>.  <7,0,1 <8,0,1 The> included <9,-1,0 ringers>> are truly embarrassing to play in <10,0,1 public>, but <11,0,1 it>'s easy to download <12,9,0 new and free ringtones> with <13,-1,0 <14,13,0 the free WAP access> that <15,-1,0 T-Mobile> includes>. <16,-1,0 The rings> are very loud though, and <17,-1,0 the sound quality> is superb... <18,-1,0 my ringer> is currently <19,0,1 <20,0,1 a song> with <21,0,1 <22,0,1 the voice> and <23,0,1 all>>>! <24,17,0 The sound quality> is great, but I guess that depends on <25,0,1 your location and service> in <26,0,1 your area>.  <27,15,0 T-Mobile> includes <28,-1,0 <29,0,1 free basic WAP> browsing which I use <30,0,1 <31,0,1 every day> on <32,3,0 this phone>, and for <33,0,1 <34,0,1 the people> who can't access <35,0,1 their favorites> in <36,0,1 T-Zones>>>>...<37,0,1 <38,0,1 all> you have to do> is hold down <39,-1,0 the pound button> and <40,0,1 your favorites> will pop up. <41,-1,0 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <42,-1,0 a call>, playing <43,-1,0 games>, or browsing <44,-1,0 the web>.  Overall <45,32,0 this> is <46,0,1 <47,45,0 an excellent phone>, <48,0,1 <49,0,1 the people> who complain about <50,47,0 this phone> really need to do <51,0,1 their research> before <52,0,1 they> blab>>, I downloaded <53,0,0 <54,43,0 new games>, <55,-1,0 backgrounds>, and <56,12,0 ringtones>> for <57,0,1 FREE>.
I just received <0,-1,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed.  <1,0,0 It> is much smaller than <2,1,0 it> looks in <3,0,1 the pics> and has <4,-1,0 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <5,-1,0 a flip phone> and doing <6,0,1 extensive damage>....<7,0,1 nothing> to worry about with <8,2,0 this baby>.  <9,-1,0 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  <10,0,1 There> aren't <11,-1,0 <12,0,1 the best song selections> for <13,-1,0 ringtones>>, but <14,-1,0 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <15,-1,0 <16,0,1 a phone> with <17,0,1 <18,-1,0 good reception>, <19,-1,0 a stylish look>, and <20,-1,0 a colorful screen>>>, <21,8,0 this> is <22,21,0 <23,-1,0 the one> for you>. <24,22,0 It> doesn't have <25,0,1 <26,0,1 tons> of <27,0,1 features> like <28,-1,0 <29,0,1 some> of <30,28,0 the other Samsung models>>, but who uses <31,0,1 <32,0,1 all> that <33,0,1 crap>> anyway>.  I'm very satisfied!
