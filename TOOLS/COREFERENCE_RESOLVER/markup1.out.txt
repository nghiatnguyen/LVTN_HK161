I am very pleased with <0,-1,0 <1,0,1 the phone> we received>.  <2,0,0 It> is <3,2,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <4,0,1 <5,3,0 this> for <6,0,1 my wife>>, she took <7,5,0 it> to <8,0,1 the ATT store> where <9,0,1 they> plugged in <10,-1,0 a sim card> and set <11,7,0 it> up within <12,0,1 5 minutes>.  <13,0,1 <14,0,1 No problems> at <15,0,1 all>.>  <16,11,0 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <17,0,1 our tile floor>. I even like <18,-1,0 <19,0,1 some> of <20,18,0 the displays>> better than <21,-1,0 <22,21,0 my S4> which is probably associated with <23,-1,0 the S3 operating system>>.  <24,-1,0 The price> was in <25,0,1 <26,0,1 line> with <27,0,1 other sellers>>. <28,0,1 Breed> shipped <29,16,0 the phone> right away. I had read <30,0,1 <31,0,1 a number> of <32,0,1 <33,0,1 reviews> on <34,29,0 this product>>> advertised elsewhere on <35,0,1 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <36,0,1 a clone> or refurbished <37,34,0 phone> as described by <38,0,1 some other buyers> (even from <39,0,1 the same seller>).  However, I think that <40,0,1 reviews> may get bundled under <41,-1,0 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for <42,0,1 sale> by <43,0,1 the specific seller>.  <44,0,1 This ad> was for <45,0,1 <46,-1,0 <47,46,0 a new S3 SGH-I747> (<48,0,1 US model>)> <49,0,1 <50,-1,0 ATT phone> and <51,0,1 that>> is exactly what we received>.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,0 <2,0,1 one> of <3,-1,0 <4,0,1 the best phones> I've ever used>>. I absolutely love <5,0,1 <6,1,0 the phone> and <7,-1,0 the photo quality>> <8,6,0 it> has.
I've had <0,0,1 <1,0,0 my <2,-1,0 8100> for> about <3,0,1 two years>>.  Dropped <4,1,0 it> on <5,0,1 <6,0,1 pavement>, <7,0,1 concrete>, <8,0,1 wood floors>, etc.> <9,0,1 at least 30 times> so <10,4,0 it> has <11,0,1 <12,0,1 a ton> of <13,0,1 scratches>> but <14,10,0 it>'s held up very well.  <15,0,1 <16,0,1 My 2-year> old> has chewed on <17,14,0 it>, licked <18,17,0 it>, smacked <19,18,0 it>, <20,0,1 <21,0,1 etc.> -- <22,0,1 still no problems>>.  <23,-1,0 Signal> has been solid, <24,-1,0 intuitive usability> is very good.  <25,-1,0 My standard battery> was great for <26,0,1 <27,0,1 the first 20 months> (<28,0,1 <29,0,1 several hours> of <30,0,1 <31,0,1 talk time>, <32,0,1 <33,0,1 a week> of <34,0,1 standby>>>>)> and just now is needing <35,-1,0 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <36,-1,0 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,0,1 <1,0,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <2,-1,0 Sprint>> for <3,0,1 about 14 months>.  After <4,1,0 my phone> got to be about <5,0,1 <6,0,1 a year> <7,0,1 old>>, <8,4,0 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <9,0,1 <10,0,1 much care> on <11,0,1 my part>>. I have not dropped <12,8,0 the phone> or done <13,0,1 anything else> to warrant <14,0,1 all the damage>.  <15,-1,0 The hinge to flip open <16,12,0 the phone> has completely broken -first <17,-1,0 just one side>> broke and pretty soon <18,-1,0 the entire thing> broke.  Then just yesterday <19,-1,0 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <20,2,1 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <21,0,1 <22,-1,0 a new phone> for <23,0,1 another 3-4 months>> so now I am going to be forced to spend about <24,0,1 $200 just> to get <25,-1,0 <26,25,0 a new phone> that will probably just break after <27,0,1 a year>>.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <28,16,0 This> is <29,28,0 <30,0,1 the first phone> I've had <31,29,0 that> has been so cheaply made>.
I know <0,0,1 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,-1,0 this phone> is <2,1,0 <3,0,1 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <4,0,1 my adult life>>. From <5,0,1 day one> I had <6,0,1 <7,0,1 problems> with <8,-1,0 reception>>, with <9,-1,0 the volume> and with <10,-1,0 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <11,2,0 It> only got worse over <12,0,1 time>. <13,-1,0 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <14,0,1 <15,0,1 sunlight> or <16,0,1 even interior light>> brighter than <17,0,1 a 60-watt bulb>. <18,-1,0 The photos> are awful. I've had <19,0,1 <20,11,0 the phone> barely a year> and <21,20,0 it> has essentially stopped working now. <22,0,1 It>'ll be <23,0,1 <24,0,1 a cold day> in <25,0,1 hell>> before I give <26,-1,0 Sony Ericsson> <27,0,1 <28,0,1 any more> of <29,0,1 my money>>.
<0,-1,0 This phone> is <1,0,0 an excellent phone>.  <2,1,0 It> has <3,-1,0 a very good color screen>, <4,2,0 it> is well disigned, <5,-1,0 the camera> is pretty good for <6,4,0 a phone>, and <7,6,0 it> has <8,0,1 numerous features>.  For <9,0,1 example>, if you have <10,0,1 <11,-1,0 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <12,-1,0 an IR sensor>>, you can transfer <13,0,1 <14,0,1 phone numbers>, <15,0,1 to-do items>, and <16,0,1 more>>.  You can also record <17,-1,1 sound>, apply <18,-1,0 themes> to you <19,-1,0 background>, and <20,0,1 <21,0,1 surf> <22,-1,0 the web>>.  <23,7,0 The phone> has <24,0,1 a very> nicely laid out <25,-1,0 <26,25,0 case and menu> that is easy to navigate>.  <27,23,0 It> also has <28,0,1 <29,0,1 a very quality feel> when you hold <30,27,0 it> in <31,0,1 your hand>>.  <32,0,1 <33,0,1 The only very minor problem> with <34,30,0 this phone>> is that <35,-1,0 the case> smudges easily.  <36,-1,0 Sony> includes <37,0,1 a nice cloth to wipe <38,34,0 it> down with>.  Besides <39,0,1 that>, <40,38,0 this phone> is incredible.  I got <41,38,0 <42,0,1 two> of <43,41,0 them>> under <44,0,1 a family plan> with <45,-1,0 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <46,-1,0 The price> is ok, so I would give <47,43,0 this phone> <48,0,1 a 5> out of <49,0,1 5>.
<0,-1,0 The phone> looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about <1,0,0 it> is <2,0,1 <3,0,1 the ease> of <4,0,1 use>>. I do not have <5,0,1 the time to tinker with <6,0,1 <7,-1,0 a gadget> for <8,0,1 an hour to find out>> how <9,0,1 a particular thing works>>. With <10,1,0 this phone>, <11,0,1 it> is really easy to browse through <12,-1,0 the menu> and find out what I am looking for. <13,-1,0 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <14,-1,0 your PDA> strictly for <15,0,1 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <16,14,0 it> as <17,10,0 the phone> keeps <18,0,1 <19,0,1 track> of <20,0,1 all <21,0,1 your appointments> and <22,0,1 phonebook>>> just fine. <23,0,1 <24,-1,0 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also works fine and if <25,17,0 the device> is on <26,0,1 any call>> is transferred to <27,24,0 the headset> automatically. Overall, <28,25,0 the phone> is <29,28,0 a good purchase> but I am <30,0,1 a little> skeptical about <31,-1,0 AT&T service>. From what I have seen, <32,-1,0 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <33,0,1 <34,-1,0 the customer service> for <35,0,1 any reason>>, expect to be on <36,0,1 <37,0,1 <38,0,1 hold> for <39,0,1 a long time>> - about <40,0,1 10-20 minutes>>).
Previous to purchasing <0,-1,0 the E105> I was <1,0,1 an S105 owner>.  I loved that <2,0,1 <3,-1,0 phone> but I> had <4,0,1 my pet> peeves about <5,3,0 it>, <6,0,0 <7,-1,0 the keys> being connected on <8,-1,0 the keypad>> made <9,5,0 it> difficult to dial at <10,0,1 times> but as long as I wasn't driving <11,0,1 this> wasn't really <12,0,1 an issue>.  Yes <13,0,1 it> was hard to see <14,0,1 <15,-1,0 the screen> in <16,0,1 daylight>> but I don't expect to see <17,0,1 <18,0,1 a crystal clear picture> on <19,-1,0 a cell phone>>, <20,19,0 they> aren't <21,0,0 mini laptops folks>.  Although <22,0,1 it> was hard to read, <23,0,1 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately I went to <24,0,1 a concert> and lost that <25,9,0 phone> and replaced <26,25,0 it> with <27,0,0 the E105>.  I have <28,0,1 no complaints>, I live in <29,0,1 a basement apartment> and <30,26,0 the S105> wouldn't get <31,0,1 service>, but <32,27,0 the E105> gets <33,0,1 one bar> and picks up <34,0,1 all> <35,0,1 my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <36,0,1 <37,0,1 the caller> on <38,0,1 the other line>> perfectly, <39,0,1 my boyfriend> has <40,32,0 one> as well and I can hear <41,0,1 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <42,0,1 <43,0,1 a room> with <44,0,1 mild background noise>>.  I haven't had <45,0,1 any problems> with <46,0,1 <47,-1,0 the screen> going <48,0,1 <49,0,1 black>, only when <50,40,0 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <51,0,1 option>>> from <52,-1,0 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <53,0,1 <54,50,0 this phone> up to <55,0,1 date>>, we'll see if <56,54,0 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,1 <1,0,1 love> with <2,-1,0 this phone>> because <3,2,0 it> was compact and lightweight.  <4,0,1 That>'s about all I love about <5,3,0 the phone> right now.  <6,5,0 It> has <7,-1,0 really bad reception>, not to mention <8,0,1 weird background noises> on <9,0,1 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,-1,0 T-Mobile> sent <11,-1,0 a replacement> after I told <12,10,0 them> of <13,0,1 the problem>, but <14,11,0 it>'s still <15,0,1 the same>.  I would buy <16,-1,0 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,1 the money>.  <18,0,1 <19,-1,0 The wallpapers> provided> are not <20,0,1 the best>, and <21,0,1 neither> are <22,-1,0 the ringtones>.  Sometimes <23,0,1 there> is <24,0,1 <25,0,1 a delay> for <26,-1,0 the screen to show up when you flip <27,6,0 open the phone>>>. <28,27,0 The phone> is <29,28,0 a nice organizer> though.  <30,-1,0 Alarms> are <31,0,1 <32,0,1 loud> as well as <33,22,0 the ringtones>>.  <34,26,0 Screen> is pretty bright.  <35,-1,0 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <36,0,1 That>'s about <37,0,1 <38,0,1 all the good features> of <39,29,0 the phone>>.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy <40,39,0 this phone>.
I've had <0,-1,0 the E105> for about <1,0,1 2 weeks> now and I must say <2,0,0 it>'s <3,2,0 <4,0,1 one> of <5,-1,0 <6,-1,0 the best phones> I've owned>>.  <7,0,1 <8,0,1 The> included <9,-1,0 ringers>> are truly embarrassing to play in <10,0,1 public>, but <11,0,1 it>'s easy to download <12,-1,0 new and free ringtones> with <13,-1,0 <14,13,0 the free WAP access> that <15,-1,0 T-Mobile> includes>. <16,-1,0 The rings> are very loud though, and <17,-1,0 the sound quality> is superb... <18,-1,0 my ringer> is currently <19,0,1 <20,0,1 a song> with <21,0,1 <22,0,1 the voice> and <23,0,1 all>>>! <24,17,0 The sound quality> is great, but I guess that depends on <25,0,1 your location and service> in <26,0,1 your area>.  <27,15,0 T-Mobile> includes <28,-1,0 <29,0,1 free basic WAP> browsing which I use <30,0,1 <31,0,1 every day> on <32,3,0 this phone>, and for <33,0,1 <34,0,1 the people> who can't access <35,0,1 their favorites> in <36,0,1 T-Zones>>>>...<37,0,1 <38,0,1 all> you have to do> is hold down <39,-1,0 the pound button> and <40,0,1 your favorites> will pop up. <41,-1,0 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <42,-1,0 a call>, playing <43,-1,0 games>, or browsing <44,-1,0 the web>.  Overall <45,32,0 this> is <46,0,1 <47,45,0 an excellent phone>, <48,0,1 <49,0,1 the people> who complain about <50,47,0 this phone> really need to do <51,0,1 their research> before <52,0,1 they> blab>>, I downloaded <53,0,0 <54,43,0 new games>, <55,-1,0 backgrounds>, and <56,12,0 ringtones>> for <57,0,1 FREE>.
I just received <0,-1,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed.  <1,0,0 It> is much smaller than <2,1,0 it> looks in <3,0,1 the pics> and has <4,-1,0 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <5,-1,0 a flip phone> and doing <6,0,1 extensive damage>.... nothing to worry about with <7,2,0 this baby>.  <8,-1,0 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  <9,0,1 There> aren't <10,0,1 <11,0,1 the best song selections> for <12,-1,0 ringtones>>, but <13,-1,0 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <14,-1,0 <15,0,1 a phone> with <16,0,1 <17,-1,0 good reception>, <18,-1,0 a stylish look>, and <19,-1,0 a colorful screen>>>, <20,7,0 this> is <21,0,1 <22,20,0 the one> for you>. <23,22,0 It> doesn't have <24,0,1 <25,0,1 tons> of <26,0,1 features> like <27,-1,0 <28,0,1 some> of <29,27,0 the other Samsung models>>, but who uses <30,0,1 <31,0,1 all> that <32,0,1 crap>> anyway>.  I'm very satisfied!
<0,-1,0 This> is <1,0,0 a great phone>, I used <2,1,0 it> with <3,-1,0 my Cingular sim> and had <4,0,1 <5,0,1 no problem> with <6,2,0 it>>. I switched to <7,0,1 a prepaid plan> and <8,6,0 it> works great. <9,-1,0 The camera> is <10,0,1 <11,0,1 better than some phones> I have seen>. <12,-1,0 The 64MB memory stick> is good for <13,-1,0 pics and music>. <14,0,1 The bad> is you can't get <15,8,0 it> from <16,0,1 <17,0,1 any carrier> in <18,0,1 the states>>, only online.
After <0,-1,0 my Motorola V180> had acted up on me and frozen <1,0,1 all the damn time>, I had to get <2,-1,0 a new one> and <3,2,0 the Samsung X495> doesn't disappoint. <4,0,1 <5,0,1 The only bad thing> about <6,3,0 this phone>> is that I can't access <7,-1,0 the internet>. <8,-1,0 Reception> is great, and <9,-1,0 the battery life> is long - <10,6,0 it> charges in <11,0,1 <12,0,1 two hours> which is really great>. So far I can go anywhere and still have <13,8,0 excellent reception>. <14,-1,0 The speaker phone> is superb, not loud, <15,14,0 it> is so clear, but you have to use <16,15,0 it> with <17,10,0 the phone open>. <18,17,0 It> is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. <19,18,0 It>'s <20,19,0 the perfect girl phone>. If you are looking for <21,-1,0 <22,0,1 a basic phone> that actually works>, <23,20,0 this> is <24,23,0 <25,0,1 the phone> you have been waiting for>!
I got <0,0,0 this phone> because <1,0,1 the price> was great, and <2,0,0 it> was easy to hold in <3,0,1 my hand>. <4,2,0 This> is <5,4,0 my first cellphone>, and I love <6,5,0 it>! I'd recommend <7,6,0 it> to anyone! <8,7,0 <9,8,0 A must-have> for everyone who is getting <10,-1,0 their first cellphone>.> <11,0,1 Easy> to use, but you have to read <12,-1,0 the instruction manual> first to learn about <13,-1,0 <14,0,1 all> of <15,-1,0 its features>>. <16,-1,0 <17,-1,0 Nice and bright screen> with <18,-1,0 <19,18,0 a nice loud ringtone> (that is, if you want to put <20,9,0 it> <21,-1,0 the max volume>)>.> I hope you choose <22,20,0 this phone> if you're unsure of which <23,-1,0 <24,-1,0 Verizon Wireless> <25,0,1 cell phone>> to buy.
I am totally in <0,0,1 love> with <1,-1,0 this phone>. <2,1,0 This> is <3,2,0 the first phone> that I could use without worrying if <4,-1,0 the signal> is going to drop. <5,3,0 It> is so much more reliable and lighter than <6,-1,0 Z500>. You plus <7,5,0 it> when you change <8,-1,0 faceplates>, you don't have to worry about <9,0,1 all the dust and faceplate> slipping off. Sure <10,7,0 it> has <11,-1,0 a very sensitive camera button> but I find <12,10,0 it> entertaining to see what pictures I have taken by <13,0,1 accident>. <14,0,1 That>'s just me but <15,0,1 oh> well. You can't have <16,0,1 your cake> and eat <17,0,1 it> too.
I really like <0,-1,0 this phone>.  <1,0,0 It>'s cute, <2,1,0 it>'s little, <3,2,0 it>'s perfect for <4,0,1 a young woman>.  I had <5,-1,0 a Pocket PC> prior to <6,3,0 this> and <7,5,0 it> was so complicated just making <8,0,1 a call>.  I wanted <9,0,1 <10,0,1 <11,0,1 something simple>, that wasn't <12,0,1 <13,-1,0 <14,13,0 a mp3 player> (i have <15,-1,0 an iPod>)>, that wasn't <16,-1,0 <17,16,0 a professional camera> (i have <18,-1,0 a nice digital cam>)>>,> or <19,-1,0 <20,19,0 a PDA> (i have <21,-1,0 a PALM TX>)>> … <22,6,0 it>'s just simple and cute. <23,22,0 It>'s <24,23,0 Bluetooth compatible>... although doesn't work <25,0,1 that great> with <26,-1,0 my Bluetooth>, but I'm not sure if <27,24,0 it>'s <28,-1,0 <29,0,1 the headset> or <30,0,1 the phone>>. <31,-1,0 <32,0,1 The ringer> on <33,27,0 it>> is <34,0,1 super quiet>... almost to <35,0,1 the point> you can barely hear <36,33,0 it> in <37,0,1 your purse>.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for <38,0,1 the> vibrating <39,0,1 feature> instead. I like how you can put <40,0,1 <41,0,1 a person's> picture> next to <42,0,1 <43,0,1 their name> in <44,0,1 your contact list>>. I can wear <45,36,0 it> in <46,0,1 <47,0,1 the back pocket> of <48,0,1 my jeans>> and <49,0,1 it>'s comfortable. <50,-1,0 Sound quality> is good, on <51,0,1 <52,0,1 both ends> I dig <53,45,0 it>>.  I'm sure you will too.
Ok, I have had <0,0,1 <1,-1,0 Verizon> for <2,0,1 less than two years>> and <3,1,0 this> is <4,3,0 my third phone>.  <5,4,0 It> is fairly new so I have <6,0,1 no complaints> as of yet.  <7,-1,0 The reception> is <8,0,1 a lot> clearer than <9,-1,0 the last one> I had.  <10,0,1 <11,0,1 The fact> that <12,5,0 it> has <13,-1,0 a camera>> is even greater.  I love taking <14,0,1 pictures> so <15,12,0 this> was perfect for me.  <16,-1,0 The picture quality> isn't <17,0,1 the best>, but for <18,13,0 a camera phone> <19,16,0 it> is pretty good compared to <20,-1,0 <21,0,1 the others> I have seen>. <22,-1,0 <23,0,1 The buttons> of <24,15,0 the phone>> are larger than <25,-1,0 some> so I don't have <26,0,1 <27,0,1 trouble> hitting <28,-1,0 the wrong buttons>>.  I haven't had <29,0,1 any difficulty> with <30,0,1 <31,-1,0 the battery> at all>, in <32,0,1 <33,0,1 fact> <34,31,0 the battery> seems to <35,0,1 <36,0,1 last> quite <37,0,1 a bit> longer than <38,-1,0 the last two phones> I had>>.  I am looking forward to <39,0,1 <40,0,1 the next 2 years> with <41,24,0 this phone>>.
I got <0,-1,0 my phone> <1,0,1 a few days> ago and <2,0,0 it> is way better than <3,-1,0 the other one> I had.  I do have to say that <4,0,1 the features> are awesome!  <5,0,1 They> are easier to use than <6,3,0 my old phone>. <7,-1,0 The camera> is easy as <8,7,0 pie> to use.  <9,2,0 It> has <10,-1,0 <11,0,1 a lot> of <12,10,0 memory>>. On <13,-1,0 the screen> you can put <14,0,1 pictures> that you take with <15,-1,0 the camera option>. Or you can download <16,0,1 <17,0,1 wallpapers> for <18,-1,0 your background>>.  <19,9,0 It> is such <20,19,0 a nice phone>. You can store <21,0,1 <22,0,1 a lot> of <23,0,1 <24,0,1 contacts> in <25,0,1 the contacts list>>>. Basically I would recommend <26,0,1 <27,20,0 this phone> for anyone>.
I upgraded <0,-1,0 my phone> <1,0,1 two months> ago from <2,-1,0 a Motorola V300> to <3,0,0 this model> because I wanted <4,0,1 <5,-1,0 a radio> and <6,-1,0 a larger keypad>>. After <7,0,1 one> month, <8,5,0 the radio> no longer worked, <9,-1,0 the battery> dies when <10,3,0 it> claims to be fully charged, <11,10,0 it> takes <12,0,1 three> tries to get <13,11,0 it> to connect when making <14,0,1 <15,-1,0 a call>, and sometimes <16,13,0 the phone>> <17,0,1 just freaks> out and resets <18,16,0 itself> while you're in <19,0,1 <20,0,1 the middle> of <21,0,1 texting>> or surfing <22,0,1 the web>. <23,18,0 It>'s flimsy. I've had <24,0,0 <25,2,0 my V300> for <26,0,1 two years>> and <27,0,1 everything> still works on <28,25,0 it>. <29,23,0 The Nokia 6101> has <30,0,1 <31,0,1 a lot> of <32,0,1 issues>>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the Nokia 6101> since <1,0,1 late October 2005>. I absolutely love <2,0,0 it>! I wouldn't trade <3,2,0 it> for <4,0,1 the world>. <5,0,1 My boyfriend> even wanted me to trade <6,3,0 it> <7,0,1 tom> get <8,-1,0 <9,8,0 a Motorola Razr V3> like he has, which does have <10,0,1 <11,0,1 its own set> of <12,0,1 great perks>>>, but I love <13,6,0 my phone>. <14,0,1 There> are <15,0,1 <16,-1,0 a few games> on <17,0,1 there> (with <18,0,1 room to download>)>, <19,1,0 the camera quality> has <20,0,1 great clarity>, <21,-1,0 the FM radio> works perfectly (and is <22,0,1 <23,0,1 a great passer> of <24,0,1 time>>), and <25,13,0 it> has <26,0,1 <27,-1,0 great reception> on <28,-1,0 <29,-1,0 T-Mobile's> GSM network>>. You can also use <30,0,1 the recorder to record <31,-1,0 your own ringtones>>. <32,25,0 It>'s great!
I recently purchased <0,-1,0 this phone> and <1,0,0 it> is so much better than <2,-1,0 the last one> I had! <3,0,1 <4,0,1 The only problem> I've had> so far is that <5,1,0 it> froze up once which can be fixed only by putting <6,-1,0 the battery> back in.
<0,-1,0 This phone> is awesome and has <1,0,1 great features>! I have had <2,0,0 it> for <3,0,1 a year> and <4,2,0 it> hasn't given me <5,0,1 a problem> once! <6,-1,0 The ringtones> are awesome! <7,-1,0 The camera quality> is great and <8,4,0 it> has <9,-1,0 <10,9,0 cool games> that are <11,0,1 <12,0,1 fun> that you can order>>. <13,8,0 This phone> really lets you show <14,0,1 your style> with <15,0,1 <16,0,1 <17,0,1 features> that let you pick <18,-1,0 your phone colors>> and <19,0,1 <20,0,1 online shopping> for <21,-1,0 ringtones and wallpaper>>>! <22,13,0 It> lets you adjust <23,-1,0 the phone volume and ringtone volume> to <24,0,1 your liking> and <25,0,1 <26,-1,0 the T-zones> online <27,0,1 shop>> has <28,-1,0 <29,0,1 <30,0,1 all the best artists> and <31,0,1 <32,0,1 songs> that gets <33,0,1 everyone dancing>, like <34,0,1 Rihanna, Chamillionare>>> and <35,0,1 a lot> more>! So, if you want <36,-1,0 <37,0,1 a reliable phone> that lets you personalize and just be you, with <38,0,1 <39,0,1 so many cheap plans> to choose from>>, <40,0,1 then you> should get <41,22,0 the Nokia 6101 Phone> (which is <42,0,1 <43,-1,0 T-Mobile> of <44,0,1 course>>!) because <45,41,0 it>'s <46,45,0 the best>!
<0,-1,0 This phone> is excellent.  <1,0,0 <2,0,1 The best> I've had as far as <3,-1,0 reliability and signal>> - may be partly because of <4,-1,0 Cingular>, too.  <5,-1,0 The buttons> are <6,0,1 a little> hard to get used to, but <7,0,1 it> doesn't take long.  <8,-1,0 The screen> is clear and easy to read, <9,-1,0 the battery> stays charged for <10,0,1 <11,0,1 a good amount> of <12,0,1 time> (especially if you don't use <13,1,0 it> to call anyone)>, and <14,13,0 it>'s just <15,14,0 an overall good phone>.  I totally recommend <16,15,0 it>.
I've owned <0,0,1 <1,-1,0 a 6101> for <2,0,1 2 years>> and never had <3,0,1 <4,0,1 a problem> even dropped <5,1,0 it> once or twice and still worked great>. <6,0,1 <7,0,1 The only reason> I'll purchase <8,-1,0 another>> is because <9,0,1 they> will not withstand <10,0,1 a 250lbs person> accidentally falling on <11,5,0 it> other than that I enjoyed <12,11,0 the phone>.
<0,-1,0 My Nokia 3220 phone> is <1,0,1 <2,0,1 a huge letdown> in <3,0,1 functionality>>.  First, I bought <4,0,0 it> for <5,-1,0 the camera>.  <6,5,0 The camera> does not allow me to send <7,0,1 pictures>.  Or <8,-1,0 <9,8,0 my settings>, that came with <10,4,0 the phone>> are not sufficient.  <11,0,1 This> is <12,0,1 <13,0,1 one> of <14,0,1 the best reasons> to have <15,4,0 a camera phone>>. <16,0,1 <17,0,1 The 2nd unique feature> that I was so excited about> was <18,-1,0 the FM radio function>.  <19,15,0 My phone> does not have <20,18,0 that capability> either.  Even after sending <21,-1,0 one> back and receiving <22,0,1 <23,19,0 <24,23,0 a brand new phone> (<25,0,1 <26,0,1 exact model> as <27,21,0 first>>)>, <28,0,1 no FM function>>.  Now I don't have <29,0,1 <30,0,1 options> but to contact <31,-1,0 Nokia> direct>, which I don't think I should have to do with <32,24,0 a brand new phone>.  So I am not impressed with <33,32,0 this model> and do not recommend <32,0,0 it>.  I was <35,0,1 a huge Nokia fan> until <36,33,0 this phone>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the phone> for about <1,0,1 6 months> now.  I talk about <2,0,1 3500 minutes> a month, send and receive about <3,0,1 <4,0,1 20 emails> <5,0,1 a day>>.  <6,0,0 The phone> has <7,0,1 <8,0,1 a bunch> of <9,0,1 great capabilities>> and is occasionally <10,0,1 a great work companion>.  <11,-1,0 The wide screen> is excellent for <12,0,1 viewing>.  <13,-1,0 The CPU functions> work <14,0,1 a little> slow which could be expected from <15,0,1 such a small package>.  <16,0,1 The frustrating part> is <17,6,0 the phone> frequently works slow as well.  <18,0,1 <19,0,1 <20,0,1 About once> <21,0,1 a week>> <22,0,1 it> is necessary to take out <23,-1,0 the battery> and let <24,23,0 it> sit for <25,0,1 a minute> before turning <26,17,0 the phone> on.>  <27,26,0 The phone> takes <28,0,1 a couple minutes> to turn on.  Overall, <29,27,0 it> seems slow and unstable which overshadows <30,0,1 <31,0,1 all> of <32,0,1 its great features>>.  Reminds me of <33,-1,0 Windows 98>.
<0,-1,0 My LG C1300> is <1,0,1 <2,1,0 a really small, clamshell phone> with <3,0,1 <4,0,1 a part> that looks like <5,0,1 <6,0,1 a mirror> on <7,0,1 top>>>>. <8,2,0 It> includes <9,0,1 <10,0,1 most basic features> including <11,0,1 <12,-1,0 text messaging>, <13,0,1 <14,-1,0 <15,0,1 multimedia> messaging>, <16,-1,0 media mall>, and <17,0,1 <18,0,1 everything> you need to download <19,0,1 <20,-1,0 wallpaper>, <21,-1,0 games>, <22,-1,0 ringtones>, and <23,0,1 <24,-1,0 applications> straight from <25,-1,0 Cingular>>>>>>>. <26,8,0 It> has <27,-1,0 an awesome battery life>, but you can't always trust <28,-1,0 the battery monitor>... sometimes <29,28,0 it> will display <30,0,1 one bar> left, and you'll have <31,0,1 <32,0,1 2 days> left>. Call <33,0,1 quality> has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have <34,0,1 bad reception>... but <35,0,1 that> is <36,0,1 <37,-1,0 the network>, not <38,26,0 the phone>>. Overall, I love <39,38,0 my LG C1300> although now I wish I might have had <40,-1,0 a camera phone>, but <41,39,0 this phone> is awesome for <42,0,1 <43,0,1 all the features> and <44,0,1 <45,-1,0 the minimal price> involved>>.
<0,-1,0 This> was <1,-1,0 <2,0,1 my first cell phone> in <3,0,1 a few years>>, <4,-1,0 my first> was <5,4,0 the Bulky bag phones>. I now own <6,-1,0 a Sony Ericsson Z500a> and have had <7,0,1 good luck> so far despite <8,0,1 the horrible reviews>. As for <9,1,0 this phone>, I liked <10,0,1 <11,0,1 the design and ease> of <12,0,1 <13,0,1 use> much better than <14,6,0 my new> <15,0,1 one>>>. I even dropped <16,9,0 it> in <17,0,1 the toilet> and after <18,0,1 <19,0,1 a week> of <20,0,1 dry out worked fine>>. <21,0,1 <22,0,1 The only thing> I realize now> is that <23,-1,0 the signal strength> wasn't that great. <24,0,1 <25,0,1 My wife> and I> both had <26,0,1 <27,16,0 these phones> and now she has <28,-1,0 a Nokia 6010> and <29,-1,0 <30,0,1 both> of <31,29,0 our new phones>> have <32,0,1 <33,-1,0 better signal strength> and <34,-1,0 clearer call reception>> than <35,16,0 the LG> did>. But I absolutely loved how <36,35,0 the LG 1300 phone> was set up <37,0,1 more> than <38,0,1 <39,0,1 either> of <40,31,0 our new ones>>.
<0,-1,0 The RAZR> is <1,0,0 a very durable and reliable phone>.  Contrary to <2,0,1 other reviews>, I have dropped <3,1,0 my phone> several times and <4,3,0 it> keeps on ticking!  <5,0,1 My wife> has <6,-1,0 the pink RAZR> and I have <7,4,0 the black RAZR> and <8,0,1 <9,0,1 both> of us> are extremely pleased.  <10,1,0 This> is by <11,10,0 <12,0,1 far the best phone> on <13,0,1 the market>>.  <14,11,0 It> separates <15,14,0 itself> from <16,-1,0 all <17,0,1 the other plastic> and <18,0,1 cheap phones>>.
Have tried <0,0,1 <1,0,1 lots> of <2,0,1 <3,-1,0 phones> and <4,-1,0 the RAZR>>> is <5,4,0 <6,0,1 the best> I've had>. <7,0,1 <8,0,1 <9,0,1 Not only> for <10,-1,0 the color>>, but also <11,-1,0 the slim profile>> allows me to put <12,5,0 it> in <13,0,1 my back pocket> and never miss <14,-1,0 a call> like I did when <15,-1,0 my old Bulky phone> was in <16,0,1 my purse>. <17,-1,0 Sound quality> is better than <18,-1,0 my last Nokia 6600>, on both <19,-1,0 the receiving and talking end>. <20,0,1 People> say <21,0,1 they> can hear me better now. Highly recommend for <22,0,0 function and style>. <23,0,0 <24,0,0 No downsides> to <25,0,0 <26,0,0 this phone> that I can see yet, as of <27,0,0 <28,0,0 2 months> of <29,0,0 use>>>.>
Had <0,-1,0 the Motorola Razor> and <1,0,0 it> got damaged so I decided to try <2,-1,0 this PEBL>. With <3,1,0 the Razor> you can use <4,-1,0 a Bluetooth ear piece> and just push <5,-1,0 one button> and say <6,0,1 <7,0,1 only the name> of who you are calling>. <8,0,1 This feature> I use <9,0,1 all the time> due to <10,0,1 my hands> being dirty at <11,0,1 work>. With <12,2,0 this stupid PEBL> you have to say <13,0,1 all this junk> like <14,0,1 <15,0,1 name dial or digit dial> then> finally <16,0,1 <17,0,1 the person’s> name>. <18,-1,0 All these extra voice commands> are not cool. <19,12,0 The PEBL> does not ever recognize what you are saying through <20,-1,0 your compatible earpiece> and if <21,19,0 it> does then you are too irritated to talk to anyone. Then I dropped <22,0,1 <23,19,0 this phone> only <24,0,1 one time> from out of <25,0,1 a faulty case>> on <26,0,1 my waist>! <27,0,1 <28,23,0 It> sure <29,0,1 dents and scratches>> easy! I will not be using <30,-1,0 Motorolas> anymore, I think <31,30,0 they> are bad for me.
I bought <0,-1,0 the L7 SLVR> last month from <1,-1,0 Amazon> and <2,0,0 it> came in as advertise.  <3,2,0 This phone> is not bad.  Looks <4,0,1 real smooth> in <5,0,1 <6,0,1 black>, easy to use> and <7,-1,0 its sound> is really clear.  <8,-1,0 The battery life> is not bad as well.  I haven't charged <9,3,0 it> in <10,0,1 <11,0,1 3 days> with <12,0,1 moderate usage>> and <13,9,0 it> still has <14,0,1 one bar> up.  <15,0,1 <16,0,1 One thing> I would suggest> is buying <17,0,1 <18,-1,0 a case> for <19,13,0 it>> because <20,19,0 it>'s easy to smudge <21,0,1 fingerprints> on <22,-1,0 the screen>.  So far <23,20,0 the phone> is fine.  If you're looking for <24,-1,0 <25,0,1 a basic phone> with <26,0,1 so-so bells and whistles>>, <27,23,0 this> would not be <28,0,1 a bad choice>.
I ordered <0,-1,0 Nokia 5800> from <1,-1,0 Bigtime Wireless> and <2,0,0 it> came fast <3,0,1 all the way> to <4,0,1 Nepal> and <5,2,0 the phone> works great. <6,5,0 The Nokia 5800> has <7,0,1 great features> and I highly recommend <8,0,1 <9,6,0 the phone> and <10,1,0 the seller>>. I am buying <11,-1,0 another one> soon from <12,10,0 Bigtime Wireless>.
Okay. <0,-1,0 The actual phone> is awesome. I love <1,0,1 all the features>, <2,0,0 it>'s small, <3,2,0 it>'s pretty. <4,3,0 The phone> is good. <5,-1,0 The service> sucks. When I bought <6,4,0 the phone>, <7,6,0 it> said <8,5,0 service> is available in <9,0,1 my area>. Not so. I have walked all over <10,0,1 this town> and cannot send or receive <11,-1,0 calls and texts> ANYWHERE. I have been wrestling for <12,0,1 <13,0,1 customer service> for <14,0,1 days>> now. Unless you live in <15,0,1 a huge city> with <16,0,1 <17,0,1 a lot> of <18,0,1 cell phone towers>>, do not get <19,7,0 this phone>. <20,19,0 It> won't work for you.
We purchased <0,0,1 <1,-1,0 A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone> for <2,0,1 a trip>> to <3,0,1 Turkey and Greece>. <4,1,0 The phone> did not work in <5,0,1 Turkey> but <6,4,0 it> did in <7,0,0 Greece>, so I believe <8,0,1 it> was <9,0,1 <10,-1,0 the service> and not <11,8,0 the phone>>. <12,0,1 My complaint> is <13,-1,0 the camera>. After documenting <14,0,1 our trip> with <15,13,0 the camera>, we now find we unable to download <16,0,1 the pictures> without purchasing, at <17,0,1 <18,0,1 additional cost>, <19,-1,0 software> and <20,-1,0 USB cable>> from <21,-1,0 Motorola>. Ridiculous!
I've had <0,0,1 <1,-1,0 this phone> for <2,0,1 2 years>>. I've dropped <3,1,0 it> several times and <4,3,0 it> still works. <5,4,0 It>'s sturdy. <6,-1,0 The design> is awesome. I like how small <7,5,0 it> is. <8,0,1 They> don't make <9,-1,0 small phones> like <10,7,0 this> anymore. I wish <11,0,1 they> still made <12,10,0 this phone>. I would buy <13,-1,0 another>. After <14,0,1 a couple years>, I find I need to replace <15,-1,0 the battery> or I may upgrade to <16,0,1 something else>. Otherwise, <17,12,0 this phone> has been with me for <18,0,1 a long time> and still works!
I had <0,0,1 <1,0,1 low expectations> about <2,-1,0 this phone>>, but when I opened <3,2,0 it> for <4,0,1 the first time> I knew <5,3,0 it> was tend to be mine. I could not want <6,-1,0 any other phone> than <7,5,0 this one>. <8,7,0 It> has <9,0,1 <10,0,1 all the features> I want and <11,8,0 it>'s very cool, modern> and at <12,-1,0 a very good price>.
I ordered <0,-1,0 the phone> last week, and <1,0,0 it> came this morning. I was very happy for <2,0,1 the fast delivery>. However, when I opened <3,0,1 the box>, <4,1,0 it> looked really cheap to me. <5,4,0 The phone> was in <6,0,1 an old package>. <7,5,0 The phone> looked old, and <8,0,1 there>'re <9,0,1 <10,0,1 scratches> on <11,7,0 it>>. Inside <12,0,1 the package>, <13,0,1 there>'re only <14,0,1 <15,11,0 a phone>, <16,-1,0 a battery>, <17,-1,0 a back cover>, <18,-1,0 a charger> and <19,-1,0 an old Cingular manual>>. <20,15,0 The phone> looked like <21,0,1 <22,20,0 a refurbished one> because <23,0,1 <24,0,1 the tiny screws> on <25,0,1 the back>> was loose>. I had to use <26,0,1 the screwdriver to fix <27,0,1 them>>. <28,22,0 It> cost <29,0,1 <30,0,1 $145> plus <31,0,1 tax>> last week, and <32,28,0 it> dropped down to <33,0,1 $139> plus <34,0,1 tax> this week. So I already got <35,0,1 <36,0,1 $6> lost>!
<0,-1,0 The Nokia 2610> is <1,0,0 a great basic phone>. If you need <2,1,0 <3,0,1 a phone> that is easy to use>, <4,2,0 this> is <5,0,1 <6,3,0 the one> for you>. <7,0,1 <8,-1,0 Call quality> and <9,-1,0 reception>> are great. <10,6,0 The phone> is straight forward and <11,0,1 very user> friendly.
<0,-1,0 The phone> is gorgeous, and <1,-1,0 the buttons> are easy to <2,0,1 type> on. <3,0,1 <4,0,1 The only downside> of <5,0,0 this device>> is <6,-1,0 the Windows software>. <7,6,0 It> sort of reminds me of <8,-1,0 Windows 1998> - <9,-1,0 limited error messages> and <10,0,1 <11,0,1 a very buggy version> of <12,-1,0 Internet Explorer>>.
