I am very pleased with the phone we received.  It is a genuine Samsung S3.  I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes.  No problems at all.  It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system.  The price was in line with other sellers. Breed shipped the phone right away. I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers (even from the same seller).  However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller.  This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received.
The Samsung Galaxy S3 is one of the best phones I've ever used. I absolutely love the phone and the photo quality it has.
I've had my N8100 for about two years.  Dropped it on pavement, concrete, wood floors, etc. at least 30 times so it has a ton of scratches but it's held up very well.  My 2-year old has chewed on it, licked it, smacked it, etc. -- still no problems.  Signal has been solid, intuitive usability is very good.  My standard battery was great for the first 20 months (several hours of talk time, a week of standby) and just now is needing a charge every other day. I'll definitely buy a Sanyo again.
