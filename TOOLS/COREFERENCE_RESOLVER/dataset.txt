 because i have to choose a star but this phone sucks. it was no only dirty but power cycles once the battery is low. the camera has a white fog and if you take more then a few pics at once it power cycles. save you cash .   i am always scared to buy second hand electronics of any kind. i lost my note 4 and at this point only another note 4 fits my needs .   sorry note 5 no micro sd and sealed battery makes you inferior to note 4 in my opinion. i was all lined up for a note 7 but .   anyways i had to get a note 4 and they were going for $250.00 to $450.00 on craigslist and ebay. i found this seller with $202.00 for a refurbished note 4. at the price i was a little skeptical but it was prime and i can always send it back right. the phone looks and works like brand new. they did a bang up job on the finish to the point i had to really look for any imperfections. works 100%, looks 100%. note condition was "refurbished good" and i would say it was far better than that. i rolled past my house and plucked it out on the mailbox on my way home from work. went right to sprint and they had it up and running and me back out the door in less than 20 minutes with a perfect working phone. no cost from sprint. note that there could have been a delay if they did not happen to have my sim card. if you have a sim card you are good. would i recommend this seller, yes and yes .   i previous had one before upgrading to the bomber note 7 since the recall, i decided to go back to the note 4 until they figuire out the new one. i had already sold my old note 4 so needed to find another .   phone was in amazing condition and had zero blemishes or defects. no problem activating with my account. seller will definitely be on my preferred list going forward .   the condition of cell was as claimed about the cell .   love it. very satisfied  .   it was okay but i had to buy another battery because the phone kept turning off. phone is great, i'm very upset i didn't get the s-pen. its kind of a big deal .   very good phone for the price .   if they had a zero star that's what i would have gave this phone. i had ordered this phone which suppose to be brand new. when i turned it on it immediately blacked out. i had plugged it up and it came back on. the phone had kept blacking out even when the battery was at 98%. i can be in the middle of surfing the internet and the phone is fully charged it still will black out even if i'm in a middle of a call. sometimes when i had made a call the person on the other end couldn't hear me. now this phone was package like it was brand new it didn't even have the ear phone that had supposedly came with it. bad purchase along with frustration .   this note 4 exceeded my expectations. i was in need of a new phone that could bridge the gap of a year before i qualified for a new upgrade. the alternative was that i could pay full price for an upgrade but i wasn't up to that. so the note 4 actually arrived in very good to excellent condition . i couldn't believe that it was a refurbished model; i had assumed that it would arrive with some noticeable defects but i was pleasantly surprised. i would say that the best part of the phone is that is has a huge screen that allows me to watch any media content. an added plus that i was unaware of prior to purchasing was the s pen. i don't use it often but it is a nice option that i have used a number of times. the phone itself works just fine for making calls but who does that anymore? the biggest plus that i can comment on is that i am no longer counting the days until my next upgrade. i may just keep this phone until it dies because i can't think of anything that it doesn't have .   the web site said this was overstock and listed that it had full warranty. it also said it was suppose to have all accessories. it came with no accessories and clearly is not new or even close. there are multiple scratches .   so this phone is functional. it does not come with any other the listed accessories. also the screenext is cracked and so is the photo lense .   i will never buy a cell phone from amazon again. i purchased this phone in august 2016, the screen went blank in october 2016. due to the warranty policies from seller/amazon i have been trying to work with samsung in getting support for this. what a waste of $$, time, and very frustrating to deal with as the amazon invoice doesnt contain the imei and serial numbers samsung needs for proof of purchase. if i would have known this was going to be the experience, i would have never made the purchase. now i know and wont make the same mistake twice .   when you sell the real thing, but this time you sold the fake stuff .   great phone but the seller cellulartradenins sent the wrong color by mistake. the seller called me and ask did i wanted to exchange to the color while. i said no the black phone was fine and working. 5 stars for cellulartradenins to this corrected .   like it .   phone worked, and i love it .   i read every review before convincing myself to order this phone. all three phones that verizon gave to me, were electrical problems .  its been nutz .  so they told me i could not replace it again .  so i was forced to find another solution .  i looked at ever phone on this site .  and i have to say that some are scary .  but held my breath and ordered it. so i decided before posting a review i was going to put it through my paces .  it has held up everything, ive thrown at it! i have had no problems with this phone .   first off, i've only had this phone for about eight hours. will update if anything negative happens .   the phone and screen are in great shape, but upon opening the case i saw that the battery was kind of beat up looking with some black smudges on it. i have been working with the phone quite a bit this afternoon and the battery dies superrrrr fast. ordered a new battery and hoping i'll be good to go from there .   not happy with the battery that was sent with this product .  wont stay charge at all. also had to purchase a new charger because it would not charge the phone. phone was not worth the money i paid for .  im really piss i done bought better phones from other places on amazon this one is not the best .   my first note 4 was really starting to act up so i purchased this one. i love the note 4 and this one was purchased new and it is working perfectly. great price. replaceable battery and expandable memory are something i insist on .   love it, much less expensive. i had water damage, purchased this as a replacement used my sim card. happiness .   battery was defective would have been really easy to put that in the items description .   i was expecting the phone is new but no .  they did factory reset to looks new.the phone is automatically die when the battery shown 20% percent. i am really disappointed .   the phone was in great condition .   great phone but it was randomly shutting off. battery wouldn't hold a charge. had to return it. ok so first review was great thoughts but now that i have had this phone for 2 or 3 days i'am sssooooooooooo disappointed like this phone looked like it was in perfect condition but now it keeps rebooting restarting overheatingðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜¡ðÿ˜¡ and has slowed down i'm very upset it was not worth the price next time i will stick to buying strictly from amazon .   i will be back with an update. nothing can beat a note ever samsung go back to that and redraw over the same concept don't try to imitate the competitor ( i phone ). the case is durable and not too bulky. i did not realize that the plastic screen cover was not included, but otherwise a nice case .   this phone was advertised as new and it clearly was refurbished, posted pic of replaced screen. everything is much bigger to see. i had an s7 but hated it because things were too small. it was just like the seller said, new, no dents, no scratches. love everything about this phone the size is just what i wanted. phone works grate but headphone jack dose not work .   camera never worked good, always a blurry picture if it worked. would turn off after i took a picture. have had a couple months and it doesn't stay on. do your homework before you buy a note 4. it was a refurbished phone but now i need to go buy another one already. had my note 2 for years .   phone actually looks fantastic even though it was only listed as "good" condition. very pleased, and so far it works well, too. my only gripe is the battery is poor. drains quickly with minimal use (50% in less than 2 hours) but i guess that's to be expected with a used phone. at least it's an inexpensive fix. i've already ordered a new battery so it's no big deal. overall, i'm happy. i'll update this rating if things change after extended use .   great .   i will review for my has band. he loves it. tablet huge for gaming .   i purchased the phone and the charging port was bad. i was very disappointed after paying all that money. the phone was billed as refurbished. i don't believe that .   this phone is great the ir blaster is one of the most useful features removable battery and expandable memory are some of the things that the new phones lack in my opinion. however my issue is with the phone i recieved from seller edge cellular marked as refurbished yet still has noticeable signs or use like dents and scratches. better than the 5 in my opinion .   cellphone works fine but i select a new when i place my order and i get a used one .   bad phone wrong phone and bad bettery. was just what i was looking for in every aspect .   had been using a feature-phone from 95+/- til 2014. got a used smart-phone in 2014, (early samsung; circa 2009), and used it till it "bricked" itself in 2016. getting current with the modern and matured android equipment was a treat. this samsung galaxy note 4 is quite an exceptional piece of technology. i have been a geek since before computers were within reach of the common man. what has been done through the years is impressive. back to the note, future shock and a steep learning curve is challenging and fun. this unit does much of what the "droid" could do only better! really big screen and i would advocate the phablet form factor. use a bluetooth! keep the phablet in a safe place. the screen is glass! connectivity is great, speed is impressive and abusive to data quotas. deal with it. refine your disciplines and the throughput will be rewarding. the note is thin, light, easily handled without dropping it, big clear screen with the much heralded oled technology behind it. good viewing. my neighbour bemoans his apple when we speak of such things. he brings it up, it is not elicited by me. the near-field-communication was a pleasant surprise, currently a "sales point" on later equipment, but samsung included it in the note 4. my fingers are slender and deft as a musician and a mechanic, still, on a smart-phone a stylus is a must. samung slipped one into a slot on the right side of the unit, (sorry for you lefties), it makes all the difference. not the common finger-painting type stylus, but a fine nibbed writing instrument. the programming to capitalise on the stylus with it's 2048 degrees of pressure sensitivity is without par. the skill to utilise all of it's features needs to be cultivated. in the absence of that it'll make you look good, even if you scribble. google's android with voice control from typing to searching to whatever your imagination digs up is fun and surprising, and used well, will enhance your productivity and you will appear to have a "grip" on your doings, whatever they may be. (be subtle and gracious, no one likes a show-off). a wise and timely purchase which has improved my efficacy in my doings. i could ramble on but, suffice it to say, i am well pleased .   phone does not charge. charging port is damaged. the product came when expected, however, after checking it out to see if anything was wrong with it. i happened to find that there was debris in the back camera lens between the protective glass shield and the lens itself. it is noticeable when taking pictures. and currently looking on the internet on how to clean what should have been cleaned before it ever being sent. after all i did pay for a new samsung galaxy note 4, not a samsung galaxy note 4 that had parts of it uncleaned .   best samsung note .   efficient, swift-moving, great battery life. i love using the s pen. i usually have many apps open at one time and no lag .   arrived in new condition. the red cell is great .   i bought this used and for some reason it won't charge. i thought it was a the cord but it's the phone itself. i did really like this phone when i got it but since it won't charge it's pretty much pointless and a waste of money .   i got the phone and it's so pretty and nice looking, however it turns off on its own and gets super hot when i am using it. i am very disappointed! i am sending it back .   buyer beware recived with screen separating from frame and after checking device with my carrier i found this item was referbished. i bought this product as new and it was sold to me as "new". very disappointed. i ordered this because it was advertised as 'new'. the phone appears to be ok, but the packaging was clearly opened in the past. more importantly though, the s pen included with the phone was not the original and appears to be an aftermarket replacement. my first clue was that the button on the pen doesn't start the air command features, and my second was when i was unable to remove the tip to replace it. i tried a pen from another note 4 and verified that the problem is with the pen which came with the phone. somewhere along the line the original pen went missing and was replaced with this fake one before being shipped to me. could this have been a phone purchased and returned? after doing some research i realized that the tip was not like the ones which were oem. i attempted to pull it out using the included tweezers, but it was actually permanently mounted and would not come out. the tip on this one was just hard plastic and did not have the softer rubber-like bit at the very tip. it was mounted so firmly in the pen that the tip of it actually snapped off when trying to pull it with the tweezers. should have come out easily. doesn't totally disable the phone to have a bad pen, but the s pen is the reason for buying a note. i'll try to replace it with an oem replacement and see what happens .   a new phone to replace a broken screen. what more could i ask for. the phone arrived ahead of the estimated delivery date. i still have to explore the features i am not used to but love the larger screen .   speakers don't work very well. returned and ordered the note 5. i'm hoping for better luck .   we i don't get 4g lte in my area for this phone do not recommend you buy this .   android is one most terrible and useless for deaf people and also this one all samsung or any brand kind of all android phone have glitches and bug for ntouch app and front camera is shutter as ntouch app not smooth well .   i'm stick with iphone period .   iphone great for ntouch app . this phone what i order use 'this verizon phone i don't get 4g lte so show my verizon iphone have lte services huh that i found out compared .   i hate android .   the note 4 i was advertised as new but i think it was used the battery doesn't last long at all compared to my other note 4 which went bad but the phone is working good. this note 4 meets all my expectations and more. i'm still learning more about this phone and loving it .   will be returning in the morning, product did come professionally packed, included was an htc charger .   new but generic cable, however i dont know what's wrong with the phone but it wont turn on, i can hear sound but i can't hear anything .   hope that i can receive a replacement/refund. note 4 came in good condition, a few little scratches or dents no big deal, but it when i went to sprint they had some issues setting up, they did get it working though. the phone works calling, wifi and network works all good but sometimes when calling someone it wont call it will just say dialing forever .   also says invalid sims and sprint cant figure out why, so if your phone broke and you need a quick phone this is a good choice but if your looking for a reliable phone this isnt it .   i bought this phone when i was eligible for an upgrade in april 2015 (it's now oct 2016). when i first started using it, i missed my old phone - the note 2. although i can't remember exactly why because i've grown accustomed to this phone now, i did almost consider returning the note 4 and just continuing to use my old note 2, which i was perfectly happy with although i noticed the battery life was starting to decline (after 2 years of use). i decided to keep the note 4 but my opinion hasn't improved. in fact, the battery life is awful. almost immediately after beginning to use the note 4, my battery wouldn't last a whole day (and by day, i mean approx 9-10 hrs) - and this is after light use as i'm at work all day and don't use it much while i'm working. it also get really hot, which is now a concern because of the exploding note 7 issue that has recently cropped up. i wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. it's a shame because the design of the phone is fine. the screen looks nice and i find samsungs very user-friendly but i'll be switching brands after this phone. as pretty as it is, it's pretty useless .   phone looked brand new .   camera doesn't work unless phone is charging. fast shipping, packaged/protected very well. extremely happy. this is a great phone. and an added surprise, it came with earbuds i wasn't expecting .   love this phone .   very pleased with the phone. works like new. looks like new. even the battery holds charge well. very pleased .   great phone, this device is my phone and computer! it's faster than my laptop (time for a laptop upgrade)! calls never disconnect, sound is loud and clear, especially in an hd call .   using this phone every day. i would buy from this seller again .   it a great phone. love this phone, but the service has a lot to be desired .   great .   phone seems to be a new sm-910a, see the next paragraph for why i say this. this is the earlier version of the note 4. seems ok. be warned though, the at&t note 4 cannot be rooted. i didn't realize this as i was at first looking for a t-mobile note 4 and didn't realize the t-mobile variant can be rooted, but not the at&t variant. this is really dirty on at&t's part, and i would just purchase a t-mobile phone and use that on at&t if i were you. the s pen had dirt on it which was really weird. the s pen is also slightly scuffed and i think the s pen is not new. there was also no product book in the box. that should have accompanied a new phone. i suspect this is a returned phone that for some reason was never registered to an account. i had to take the phone into the at&t store to have the imei number for the sim on the account updated which is something that is supposed to be automatic .   i really love the larger screen and it makes typing out text messages so much easier on my older eyes. i have not had any issues. it is like having a computer in your pocket. i would recommend .   i love the phone however it did not even make it 6 months. it arrived with some cosmetic defects. no worries it worked fine. then slowly over time it started having issues and then one day it just would not turn on past the red verizon wireless screen. :( i had to get a new phone. this was disappointing to say the least! it also had compatibility issues with my lg model hbs-910 headset. (harmon/kardon) it would periodically turn off the headset. huge disappointment i really liked this phone. i think it was not remanufactured well. be wary if you purchase a remanufactured phone .   i can even used it now because u posted it has unlock phone but it would lock i don,t know what to do with or may be i will return and send me back unlock phone thank i will appreciate for feed back. needing a quick replacement for my dinosaur, i worked with friends who have been very pleased with their note 4. the note 4 has been very easy to transition without any large learning curve .   it was good thanks. as advertized. very happy with the phone. replaceable battery, great screen, perfect for working on the go .   this phone is the best i've owned sofar and is possible the last of replacable battery units because i hold on to phones to long. the only downside but is not due to the phone its-self but all the terrible software updates that either don't work right and/or take away nice features that somehow the programmers don't think you need or want. i like full functionality myself .   phone was in good condition but the battery went bad 2 weeks after purchase .   good. not as described .   phone broke after only 3 months of use. most expensive door stop ever purchased. i'm a very unhappy customer .   bought it used. (5stars after the 3rd phone received due to not matching description) lost a star due to not matching description. and loosing another star due to it no longer working. does not recognize sim card or sd card. took it to get repaired. replaced sim card slot and no difference. buying a new one .   all good. phone was as expected. packaged well, arrived as scheduled. no problems .   phone works great and delivered as described. pjone is in like new condition. so far so good. can jot complain. company is a++. i still this day am simply in a stunned shock that forces me to altruistically must make a plea to amazon for advise & wisdom as to how such my decision of brand/ specificmodel( that took me 3wks spent research,re-review, coinciding functions/my daily life/the cost i contemplated just to experience **** inexplicable to be forced to state: âˆ†reliablity of samsung as a phone .  so i actually can conduct a conversation like my greatgrandmother could! as i have for 13yrs.at this house .   âˆ†the sanity to accomplish 1hour of network to obtain solutions/relief/a resource on every level of daily life. âˆ†i cannot hire services of repair, i cannot receive a text/email/voicemail conduct any contribution to another human whom has reached out to me. âˆ† i pay for the quality of device for signal transmission to maintain its stability while fixed on any square foot of my property .   love it .   prompt delivery, brand new phone, as advertised. no problems. not very happy with the condition of the phone i recieved. all 4 corners have deep scars like it has been dropped alot. i have pictures but do not see how to upload them .   i bought this to replace a 2 year old galaxy note 2. it seems a lot faster than my note 2, and has some exceptional features that the note 2 did not have, like being able to block callers. i've had two problems, however. my at&t signal has not been as strong, i get a lot of dropped calls, and sometimes when i place a call thru bluetooth in my car, it won't go through. i had none of these problems with my note 2, and don't know if it's the phone or what .   pros i use verizon and phone programmed up on first try 4 g. no issues. no phone calls. upgrade from note 2 phone works great and very happy with the order fast delivery on shipping. phone was brand new in samsung factory sealed box. head phones a bonus. cons when i first got the phone it would not turn on at all. i had to first plug it into a charger and battery was at zero charge. phone would freeze up when battery was under 35 % (when i was using the camera) charged and i had to take the battery out to reboot. i noticed when it did that i had to charge the battery. it would read zero charge and after 2 minutes it was back in the 30 % charge. i purchased a good rated battery here on amazon and started using it. took care off all my problems and the phone has been great since the new battery. battery lasts all day. just like my note2. phone does not feel as good in the hand as my note 2. the phone has a flat edge and my note 2 was more rounded. my note 2 lasted me 4 years because i could put new battery's in it. i am truly disappointed with samsung. i find it very hard to buy a phone that will only last 12 to 18 months because the battery will be worn out. i know samsung is riding a big high right now but time will tell. i guess i will have to look at the v20 (lg) down the road when this note 4 is done. i just logged on to verizon and the note 7 is selling for $864, i paid less than 1/2 price for this note 4. is it the newest and greatest? no, but it doesn't have to be to make me happy. i did not file a claim against the seller or amazon because i had to buy a new battery. they did what i paid them to do. i feel samsung owes me a refund for the new battery. speaking of battery problems the note 7 has a recall on the battery and you can not even buy the phone right now. bet they wish it was removable now .   bad charging port battery does not keep a full charge. i love this phone! only one knock on the bottom left corner but i leave a case on my phone so it's covered up. screen is in great shape. it's a great price for such a nice phone! i couldn't be happier with this purchase .   no issues .   unfortunately, i have had nothing but problems with this phone. the phone worked great for the 1st 45 days and then soon after that my phone was shutting off at 30% battery level. i purchased a replacement battery and that solved this issue. however, my phone now has a lag to turn on when it is in sleep mode. i have tried alot of different options, reset phone, delete apps, etc and unfortunately no luck. this leads me to believe that the phoenix is defective. i can not return the phone since it's past the 30 days. therefore, i 'm in the market for another replacement phone after 90-days of this ordeal . i received the phone from goodcellas  .  buyer beware. i bought this phone refurbished and it came with a small scratch on it, which is fine. the phone has some features that aren't my favorite, but overall it's much better than my old phone. the one thing i was upset about was the charger. it did not come with a wall adapter and now the charger won't even charge anything, it just broke .   love the phone .   thank you. great customer service, product didn't meet expectations, blue tooth didn't work on note 4. when i notified them they excellent on the return postage a,don't redeposit funds back onto my c.c. no problem on the customer side .   exactly what was advertised .   rip off .   do not buy this phone. it is advertised as new but when it came it has very visible signs of wear and gunk in the crevices and holes. it isn't even a used phone in good condition. junk .   very fast and fitting for someone who enjoys multitasking and amazing video quality. it provides me with everything that i could ask for from a phone with prices that i can work with! no need to go and grab a note 7 and brag about how that phone can take photos in the dark. other than the pen and camera improvement .   there really isn't much to brag about therefore here i am with another note 4 .   this is a review of cellulartradeins, the vendor from whom i purchased the phone, not the phone itself. it was advertised as new and the invoice says it's new. but when i went to verizon to activate it, they told me it had been used on 2 accounts previously. the phone is actually fine, except the charger doesn't work right. i have let cellulartradeins know that i'm not happy; i doubt they will do anything to fix it. i would advise anyone thinking of buying from them to think again .   finally a provider who sells what they say they do.pirfect condition works great. thank you love the phone .   when i first received the phone it was in great condition, but just as the warranty went off it started to freeze up ,blinking out  .   the phone is fine it's the battery that's junk. the phone onlyvstays on when plugged in, it shuts off after unplugged. have a new battery in the way .   all good. son loves it! especially since he loses everything & this phone notifies you if you are away from the stylus =). so far this phone has been great! a couple of minor problems but overall light years better than my old phone, an lgg2 which gave me problems from day one and was such a pain to deal with for two years! i'm praying that this note 4 will continue to work as well as it is now :) l highly recommend it .   i usually buy only new electronic equipment, but sprint didn't have the note 4 and that's what i wanted. this used phone works great! i've had it in use now for a little over a month and no quirks. very happy with my purchase. the phone looked new even though it was described as 'good', which usually denotes some sign of wear. the packaging was very good and customer service awesome .   do not buy this phone. this is the only electronic device i've ever regretted purchasing. (and this one is a replacement!) the bluetooth will just stop or give you grief connecting. the battery drops to 20% and the phone dies. sometimes the camera makes the phone crash (or won't focus). it recognizes some wi-fi networks you use often--but not others. heart rate monitor? sometimes, sometimes not. i have yet to find a keyboard that actually works (the native keyboard often experiences latency). it requires frequent restarting or cache clearing or other babysitting. samsung has done what i thought would be impossible: converted me back to the iphone. (and i'm not an apple fan). phone constantly reboots. battery overheats and as i write this its gone from 50% to 47% plugged in. sometimes it doesn't even respond when trying to exit am app. not saying this is anyone's fault i bought a used phone and got a used phone. update: last week lost all ability to view the screen. 81.00 later i can view the screen. today (9/24/2016) i am having connectivity problems that sprint (2 hrs phone support on 9/23/2016) ( 1 1/2 hrs at store in wappingers falls ny) can't seem to identify the issues but rendered the phone inoperable. update: called sprint yesterday to tell them amazon would issue a credit for the phone so i needed it back. sprint informed me that they reset the phone and shipped to overland park kansas for diagnostics. they offered me a discounted note 4. wtf would i pay amazon and then turn around and pay sprint? so now i'm looking to go to prepaid. i will not spend another dime with sprint or amazon. the phone came in nicely packed. the phone itself is really nice, even if its an older model. the only thing i didn't like was that there were way too many apps on it that were running, but this is coming from someone who had been using a blackberry z30 prior to this purchase. other than that, its pretty sweet tho. i'd definitely do business with them again .   the phone arrived on time and in perfect working order. i have not had any problems. i love the display screen size and stylus .   the sim card reader stopped working after a week. at least the return went well. i loved my note 4 .   i've recently upgraded to note 7 and am definitely missing my battery life of the n4. this phone is durable, long lasting, it does has microsd slot, s pen feature, no lag. it was a great phone. even strong enough to last through my 4yr olds torture. haha .   new out of the box plus a great price. i had the phone for about a week and had no problem yet .   bought used item from atomic cellular and product meets expectations. advertised as "very good" condition and it was. very minor cosmetic blemishes and excellent working condition with decent battery life .   worked like s*** from the day i bought it. came as described. but missing a very important feature it should have .   great when i saw it. i think someone accidently tossed it in the move. i actually preferred it to the edge or other notes. i wish they could offer a discount on a freak situation like this. great product, nice picture and vivid screen .   it's a great phone. it's the second one in my household. there is really no downside to this phone. i even like it better than the note 5. fantastic choice if you don't want to pay $899 for the newest one and don't want to get stuck with a contract. add the wireless charging back and you are good to go. this is the last note model to have a user replaceable battery. android marshmallow works great on this device. i'll be using this until it falls apart .   great phone. great price. pleasure doing business :). hands down the best phone in that generation. of course, it has been replaced by the n5 and the n7 as the best phones onâ€‹ the market. but for most people, the n4 will fulfill all their needs .   ended up getting a note 3 instead, but still love it. phone was advertised as "new" yet the chamfer around the camera is scratched and a fake oem charger was included (the adaptor buzzes when plugged in and the usb brand on the cable is misaligned .   nothing to be disappointed in~ a great buy for me .   i previously had a galaxy 4. it was beyond broken. after some web surfing, decided i wanted a note 4. i'd never order a phone offline before let alone a used one so i was a bit sceptical. anyways, i received my phone today. it looked brand new. set up was also no problem whatsoever with sprint. definitely, happy with my purchase. if i need another phone way in the future will look here first .   it's freakin' awesome. camera instantly takes clear and crisp pictures. much improved over the note 2 .   screen was scratched, battery was shot .   this is a fantastic phone, don't regret this purchase on bit .   wow! thats all i can say. the phone was marked under used with some minor flaws. more like the phone looked brand new. just need to get it activated tomorrow and i will send another review with that. very happy with the product and the price. for anymore of my used cell phone needs i will be coming back .   the phone had been "rooted" according to the workers at verizon. an hour and a half later, i was told that the phone had been intentionally tampered with, and would not be able to download apps .   really like this phone. fun and fast. enjoy the bigger screen. it has more features and functions than i have used at this time, but will continue to master .   the phone was great, the one reason, i didn't give the phone five stars is because they send me the charger for an lg phone. other then that the phone a great .   like new and a really good deal for the price. better features and more user friendly than the note 3 i had prior to .   i really like this phone, it is quick and i can see everything on the bigger screen .   although the phone had faulty software and not work i still gave â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† because of the professional, prompt and outstanding attention given to the matter. i would recommend this seller as well as buy again from. a+. better than i thought and fast delivery. came fast and works perfect. exactly what it was billed to be. new in box note 4, great price .   this phone was a wonderful bargain and i found out it is still under samsung warranty. a few days after getting the phone, it factory reset itself and locked up because i did not have the original registration info (the original purchaser had it) i had to end up sending it into samsung to get it fixed. the seller should have made certain this was not going to be a problem for the new purchaser. it had nothing to do with amazon. it was really a pain. i had to buy a second cheap phone to use in meantime .   my phone only lasted about a year before it suffered from non stop crashes and freezing. i sent it in to get repaired under warranty. the warranty process was simple, but it took nearly two weeks to get repaired and sent back to me. that is quite a bit of time to be without a working phone. i got it back. everything seemed fine and fixed. i open snapchat and notice a cool new filter on my front facing camera, neat! oh wait, just kidding, that's just a result of my screen separating from the body of the phone allowing the lense to be exposed and dust and dirt to get everywhere inside my phone. overall, i give this phone a 1 star review. i expect at this price point for my phone to last much longer than 1 year max and i also expected better warranty service and repairs from samsung. i will have to think long and hard before buying another samsung product again .   so far so good. the phone actually looked like new condition almost. and for cricket wireless customers all you to do is pop in your sim card then restart your phone. and make sure it's attachments version(i don't know about t-mobile and verizon version won't work with my sim card) .   bought the phone as new, the phone box i received was open, i went to at&t website to make a request to unlock it, i found that there was a request made by someone else 2 months before i purchased the phone and it was denied (i purchased the phone in july, 2016, the request to unlock it was made in may, 2016). when i called amazon they said they can't do a replacement and that i can return it and then buy a another one, horrible experience .   this phone would not keep a charge by the second day of use . it turned off and never fully charged . the first day i had it i logged into all 4 of my email accounts and the next morning google alerted me that someone in malaysia attempted to log into all 4 of my accounts  .   try a different seller . i returned it on the third day and received a full refund in a timely manner .   phones dies after 20% and won't cut back on unless charged more bit other than that it's fine. item was sold and shipped by wireless experts inc., the phone was not for use in united states. the phone was intended for use in asia, europe & south america. therefore when used in united states it did not operate properly .   extremely quick delivery. phone works great .   i ordered a "new" phone but instead i get one that is covered in scratches with no accessories. unacceptable .   its a pocket computer with a phone app built in. its got the best camera you've ever seen. ive been a feature photographer for decades and its always about having your camera with you at all times. yuk  .   with this marvel, i have a kick-ass camera with me at all times. get one  .   watch a lot of the youtube tutorials to get easily familiar with the never ending array of features and prepare yourself to be amazed. blows away apple i-6 and i am a huge apple fan  .   the stylus to write and draw with and the camera and the touch screen features are the bomb  .   phone worked good. had to return because could not recive a sim card for it to get service .   i bought the phone back in april for $320; i received the phone in chinese, i was able to change the language no problem; however, after the second month the screen was coming off ( yes, the glass on the screen was coming off ) , so ended up having piece of garbage. i will try to have it repair, but will never purchased a phone on line again. unable to upload picture dont have another phone available. i will never buy a phone online again! didn't work at all! took it to sprint and they got it to connect and i made 2 calls and phone died and the green error troll popped up and couldn't do anything. wouldn't even turn on .   i had a bad time with this phone. it wasnt inspected properly i think. it had many problems. -malfunctioning battery that would die quickly while displaying 30% capacity. -ir baster didnt work -the phone's firmware had been rooted or otherwise tampered with. couldn't get updates. some apps wouldnt work. -phone came with shoddy aftermarket charger that barely charged. if i were you i wouldnt buy a phone from these folks. but its a free country, so if you really want a bad phone you can get one if you want. don't blame me when you are sad and mad though, thats on you buddy .   very nice design! large screen is just awesome .   bought the phone at a great price! it works perfectly. very happy with this purchase .   i would recommend this company i love the note 4 works perfect received fast very satisfied. i like this phone .   love it! with prime, i received my phone the same day (for free). i've had it for a little over a month and have no complaints .   has a battery i can switch out .   the condition was incredible and the phone is everything i wanted it to be .   good phone arrived as promised. great phone for a great price. all of the features are wonderful and easy to use. false description.came with broken front camera. purchased this phone in "very good" condition and it was exactly as described. zero scratches and just one small little faded corner on the case from what appears to be wear from a case. not noticeable whatsoever. love my phone and the ease of this transaction .   phone is defective and unable to return it because i traveled after purchase. thought maybe it just came with a bad battery or charger. i replaced both, after taking it to someone i found out the problem was with the phone the whole time. waste of a bunch of money when they said the phone was new .   i recently got this phone and have been using it for a week and it works pretty well. it came in really clean and i only saw one tiny scratch but it wasn't really noticeable at all. i love my new phone and plus, i got it for a cheap price while it looked brand new! however, the screen was kind of weird appearing because it had a little faded label inside of it? but that wasn't really noticeable. overall, i think this phone has all 5 stars of functionality, appearance, and shipment too! i really recommend this to the other customers and they won't regret on buying it! :). fine phone. as described. easy to set up with my carrier .   this phone is great. its fast, easy and fun .   after 2 months (ordered may 15th) we ordered 2 of these. they arrived brand new in the box. the camera will not focus on either phone and now both the wife's and mine have started freezing up and rebooting. i have taken them in to at&t and they have nothing. i've read the internet problems with the cameras. we cannot text pictures while attached to our home or any wifi connection. too bad really i had one of these while with sprint and the camera and phone were excellent. these take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute or more and on occasion i have to go into the modes to get to focus. by then our camera moment is gone. very disappointed .   great phone! i upgraded from a galaxy s3 and you really get your bang for your buck at the lower price. i use my phone a lot and am loving the note 4. while not the newest model out there, it still has great specs and performs great. it just updated to marshmallow and am expecting to get a lot of use out of it .   love the notes. perfect for everyday use .   this is the second phone from the same company and both have been faulty. the "like new" one cost more and was cosmetically damaged with chips and scratches. don't trust the descriptions .   awesome. lasted 15 months and died suddenly. the phone works perfectly. this is the phone i've been searching for. i have tried multiple smart phones over the years and even some iphones. all of them had one problem or another. this phone, however, totally works for me. i decided on the note 4 instead of the newer note 5 or 6 because everyone was saying that you couldn't put an sd card into the newer notes, and everyone seemed to miss this phone. so i went ahead and got this phone and was able to put an sd card into it. i love that i can write with the little pen, which is really helping me to stay organized. i also love how the screens on this can pop up full sized or small, so that i can see multiple windows on my screen at once - just like on my computer. that is very useful for someone like me - an office type who is used to multi-tasking. it's also easy to switch between the windows. i use the phone with pageplus and have had no problems or any dropped calls that i can remember. i have been using the phone for several months now and will probably buy another one when i finally drop this one too many times. (which we all know happens .  ). its wasn't what i wanted sorry .   got explosive product that burned my hand, amazon didn't do anything about it .   purchase the item and it was listed new. when the phone arrived i noticed that the battery was dead, i paid no mind to it and charge the phone - 100%. after just 20 minutes of use i found that the battery was draining fast. i connected the phone and let it charge further and i still have problems with the battery life. contacted samsung which then i was informed that the phone was used and that i was the second owner therefore the warranty has expired. order new battery on amazon now the phone works great .   it gets very hot am freezes alot. traded my samsung galaxy s4 for this phone. best phone ever! i selected this phone over the iphone 6 plus. do your research on the comparisons (e.g., price, functionality, productivity, etc.) works as expected .   great phone .   shipped fast worked well. perfect. its a t-mobile phone .   purchased this phone 3 days ago .   doesn't allow access to 4g network. great phone .   ok phone. gets heavy sometimes. battery dies at 20 percent and freezes often. then again its a used phone from online so not expecting much .   pretty decent for the price works like a charm. large, brilliant screen. fun phone .   low rom. i wanted 128 gb of rom. iow ram , i wanted 4 gb of ram. or higher! 3.0 usb would be great. i enjoyed that on my galaxy note 3 .   on time delivery but the phone looks too old and dirty .   this is a pretty nice phone. i've had it for just over a year now & today got the android marshmallow update .   which is so far so good. the features that this phone has are great. i don't use half of them! i've found that i really love the size and count on the larger more detailed screen for looking at photos and using dual screen between an app and my email or text. the size still fits easily in my pocket and purse and doesn't give me any trouble. the sound quality is great, i used it while jogging for listening to music or to play audiobooks aloud at home, everything has always been crystal clear. ultra power saving mode is amazing and has helped me a great deal several times. i am really happy with my note .   product had bad esn. thanks. fingerprint reader is useless. ok battery. a bit longer than note 3 and more awkward to hold. i would consider the note 3 over this. also note 3 has better battery life .   cosmetically this phone is in pristine condition .   but after days two of use, i started to have issues with the phone and they have only been getting worse and irritating me. it constantly freezes, reboots for no reason, gets stuck on reboot screen, non responsive a lot of times .   since i received the phone, its been a useless pos because i can't use the minimum features of the note 5, such as make/receive a call much less text! i thought it would "go away" with the system update to marshmallow nope .   i just need my money back .   it was really nice .   its was well worth it. every thing was delivered on time and the phone looks new and works great .   the screen display (extremely vivid) is awesome! there is so much that can be done with this phone. it's a great tool for my busy life .   i love this phone. the first new wall charger that came with the phone was defective, but the company immediately replaced it with a working wall charger and i am happy .   bad teception .  dont get hardly any calls .   one of the cheapest used note 4s on amazon. it came with only minor scrapes on the edges that my case now covers up. the screen was scratch-free but the rear camera had a speck on the inner lens that showed up as a small black splotch in photos. happy overall; i got what i paid for .   i love it  .   purchased this as a replacement for a store bought verizon galaxy note 4, which bricked after one and a half years of use. decided to stay with the note 4 until samsung brings back at least the expandable storage (sd card slot) in future releases. the option of having a removable battery is nice, however, i never purchased a second battery for my previous note 4. to me, the look and feel of android lollipop and now marshmallow, are looking more and more like apple's ios; another reason i opted for the note 4 once more, kit kat 4.4.4, which this phone comes with, doesn't have that ios look and feel to it, just compare the color schemes of lollipop and marshmallow to ios, the general direction of themes and icon design and you'll know exactly what i'm talking about. a substantial discount from the original release price is another reason why i decided to re-purchase the galaxy note 4. this "phone", or more like a "pocket pc" with calling capabilities, remains an excellent productivity and information tool; perfect for recording my class lectures (audio or video), annotating on pdf files, power points, pictures, screen captures as well as free hand note taking, sketching and diagraming. despite the short life span of my first note 4, this hotrod phablet remains highly recommended .   i have only had the phone for 4 months. it does not show how many windows you have open. you have to click on the right of the button to see open windows. if you want to close the windows click to the left of the button. i use wifi at the house to save on data. also i use the power saver to keep the battery higher. i do know i have not had any more dropped calls with this phone like i had with the other phone and service i had .   awesome phone. looked like new and works flawlessly. very pleased. thanks .   the phone if it worked properly is great. its microphone doesn't work though. the other party can't hear me .   dislike product. i do really like the phone, but the battery that comes with it is crap! it goes from 40% to 0% with no warning in seconds .   cool. package arrived as planned even a little earlier then expected. phone works lovely and it's perfect. i would recommend this seller. product came with new phone(not refurbished) new battery, new charger cable, new fast adaptive power brick as well. spot on .   hmm my husband loves this phone, good review coming from him. broke after only three months .   new phone. met all my expectations. i bought a new note 4 and the mobile is detective .   i bought this in july 2015. it worked great until june 2016, when one day it suddenly began to act sluggish and unresponsive to swipes or even buttons. i performed a factory reset incase i might have some how downloaded a bug, but the problem persisted. amazon has not been helpful in resolving this issue, and it seems that my phone just crapped out on me. i will buy my phones directly from verizon in the future, given that they have one year warranties while amazon only offers 30 days .   so far so good no issues at all. could not ask for anything to work any better. not sure if i'm overly happy. but i'm not dissatisfied. there seems to be a few bugs in this model. updates aren't redily available from all carriers .   love it  .   short after the 30 day warranty expired phone had several issues. it started to get very hot and then stopped working. i contacted seller and was directed back the manufacturer. seller feedback: sorry to hear about the issue with the phone. unfortunately our return policy is set by amazon and after 30 days you would need to contact samsung for assistance .   best smartphone ever! and also the best deal on planet. better than the newer generation phones! i did a lot research, and when i saw the screen, i was still amazed at the gorgeous screen. it is totally unbelievable. i was using galaxy s4 and the screen in note 4 is so much better. it is much better than samsung note 5, galaxy s6, s7 etc. because it has replaceable battery and micro sd card. you can buy 128g with less than 40 dollars and put it in. and the advantage of inserting sd card is beyond that. if you take a short trip, you may simply take more sd cards and swap them when they are full and no worry or need to transfer to a pc. i don't like the direction that samsung is taking with the newer generation phones. much better than iphone for the same reason. this is the best phone available on market. note 3 is also good, but note 4 is so much better in screen and in camera. the camera quality is awesome. although nowhere near dslr quality, it can beats a lot of point and shoot digital cameras easily. for taking casual shots, it is definitely more than adequate. the ois is great as well for low light condition. add review after two weeks' use, i still think this is the best phone ever on market. i personally like the back cover matt fish better. it is not slippery. some people say it is cheap plastic like, but i consider it to be extremely practical. i had some slippery phones before and i always broke them by accident. this one is good. the edge is more "boxy" than the slippery round edge in new galaxy note 5 or s7 phones. i think "boxy" is good. it gives good holding point to hand as it is a very big phone. i compared this phone screen to all my friends' phone screen and i haven't see any phone has a better screen. of course the other phones like 6s plus are not visually worse than note 4 in terms of screen. i still think this is the best phone samsung ever made. only feature i would like it to have is the waterproof. well, not really waterproof like dropping it in the pool, but splash proof so that i won't worry much about rain, drink, etc. galaxy s5 does that wonderfully with a removable back cover. i hope the future note 7 can do that. i think samsung should really get back to where it excels, while not trying to follow the iphone direction. what is the shining glass back cover in note 5 good for? some say it feels expensive, flawless craftsmanship, blah blah. i call it "impractical" - easy to slip and break, no expandable sd card, no exchangeable battery. probably note 4 is the last of its kind of the best samsung phones .   this phone is making samsung great again! i didn't keep it however i took it out to inspect the condition and see if i liked the note style phone. looked great, operated fine, recognized sim card. attractive looking phone and was winning! i am defiantly getting the note 6 when it comes out .   takes 4 hours to charge! i cannot download any files or send any lengthy text messages. if the text messages is more than a few lines it will not send, i wasted my money i'm not happy with this phone .   when the galaxy note 4 was released in 2014 my sister upgraded to a at&t model from a galaxy s4 from the same carrier. she live in the usa and i'm living in jamaica. she told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that i fell in love with the device myself. i myself could only afford a galaxy grand 2 duos that year. now i found the price for a used galaxy note 4 is more affordable for me and so i buy 2, one for my neighbor and one for myself. i'm loving my note 4 .   nice. i have since upgraded to the note 5 but we still use the note 4 for my granddaughter! ++a+a++a+a+a. my handy lg g3 had passed on so i had to look for a new phone. i loved the large size of the g3 but i wanted something a little bit better. i could have went with the g4 but i wanted to see my other options. yes, this phone model is a couple years old. but that did not turn me away. the main reason i chose this over the note 5 was the removable battery. nothing is more annoying than risking the phones screen just to change a bad battery. this phone is a little bit larger than my former g3 which i'm fine with simply because i have large hands. now, i don't know if this phone was a refurbished model or not. it did not come with the normal screen protector that you see with the instructions. but the phone itself looked flawless. it did include the sim card for the verizon network against what people have said in the questions. the fast charger that came with it is very fast as it runs at 4amps. but, i'm curious as to how much that is going to effect the battery's life. i love this phone. it feels great in the hand and hopefully it will last me quite a while .   i return this order which was a at&t and i could use it with my carrier, there was nothing wrong whit the phone .   samsung galaxy note 4, charcoal black 32gb. works grate and luv the price. i'm very happy with the phone. it looks brand new! we bought it to use with boost mobile and had no issues activating it. i am having issues using the finger print lock. i either swip too fast, too slow or don't use the full print. lol. i'm sure i'll get use to it .   only issue is my selfie front camera not working other than that phone performs perfectly. i was told it was a new phone the package never opened. i didn't get the headphones you normally would when you get a new phone .   purchased this from wireless plus inc. it was just as desribed. brand new sealed in a box. love this phone and wireless plus inc was great to work with. highly recommended .   fast delivery and better than buying new. cell in new condition thanks. great phone. i love the bright, large, sharp display. great sound. like that it had a sd slot and removable battery, those 2 features are missing on the note 5 and was the key factors that lead me to consider the note 4 instead .   came broken. no audio or videos could be played and no calls could be made. attempted to exchange and they never contacted me when another note 4 was in stock .   love my phone well be coming back to buy more phones in the future from this seller :). the phone was great, sent it back because it wasn't at&t as advertised and not completely unlocked either. still waiting on my return refund .   product had no camera lens. also, phone stopped working .   went from an iphone 6s to this phone. first phone froze and cut off a lot, so i returned it for a replacement. second phone doesnt freeze near as often, but the phone is a little sluggish, especially coming from iphone 6s. i would recommend this phone to some, but not those who are on their phones heavily and all the time .   no marks nor scratches on screen  .   amazing. love it. use the video and photo features more than anything else and i an totally happy with it .   great phone, replaced a note 3 that got broken due to my fault. company purchased from was great to deal with. 100%. this seller exceeded my expectations. great packaging, fast delivery, and even charged the phone for me. every thing was also properly described as stated. i highly recommend this phone and seller. only downside seems to be the battery life but nothing the fast charging feature can't fix .   it is what was described but shuts off when it gets down to 30% n will not come on until u connect it to a charger .   arrived in great condition and was able to get it activated promptly in a verizon store. i've had some very minor freezing issues, but otherwise everything works as expected .   i waited a considerable amount of time to write my review, due to the nature of my purchase. i can now honestly say that i am 100% satisfied .   update: 11/16/16: still have this phone, and i really like it. i've tried it with the charging case (it's ok), but right now i have it in an otterbox to keep it safe. i did get it working fine with my moto360 smartwatch. and that's good because i'm using both with a sleep aid ap, and it measures my sleep cycles. ("sleep as android is the app"). in 3 days, this app helped me sleep better. i'm getting a special pulse-oximeter that works with the app too. i am still very pleased with this phone. this is a device you are going to want, the this is a company you are going to want to do business with! i want to talk about this device in some detail. i am very happy with it, but, like any device, it has it's pros and cons. i also want to say a few words about the seller, who did a really fantastic job of overdelivering and underpromising. i bought this device because my galaxy s5's charging port got damaged when the phone (had an extended battery) fell off the vent clip on a road trip. i have a rare unlimited data plan (had it a long time) from verizon, and in order to keep it, have to buy a new device instead of getting it on contract. i use the hotspot constantly. this takes up a lot of the phone's battery. more on this in a minute. i chose the note 4 because, unlike the note 5, it has a replaceable battery. my cellphone is my lifeline: it is my sole internet, and it is a critical safety tool. it has to work, and it must have reliable service. i live in the dc metro area, and verizon has the better coverage (even in subway tunnels). the note 4 is nice looking: i bought black one, and it has beautiful silver trim. there is a pen inside (i didn't see it at first, and thought it was missing), and the phone is set to make a sound and flash a warning on the screen when it gets far away from the pen. (i really like this feature). i originally believed the phone i had didn't come with the pen (more on that in a minute). this pen is by far the nicest stylus i have ever used. it is effortless--there are tools on the play store that make even better use of it's abilities, but it comes with very nice basic abilities (my absolute favorite is the clip grabber). i'm going to have to make time to learn all the abilities. i bought the note 4 from cell-sell, i also bought an s-view wireless charging cover, (which appears to have a glass screen) and a fast wireless (there is also "regular" wireless) charger (all the accessories are from different vendors). the note comes with a micro usb charger, which i initially thought was inferior to the 3.0 usb on the galaxy s5. i believe i was wrong on this. the note 4 wired charger is really fast. how fast? (about 20% in 15 minutes). however, the case gets hot, not warm, hot. so, when i use the wired charger, i make sure i turn the phone over on it's face to keep the back cool. heat is a big killer of portable devices. that is why you should have a laptop cooler underneath your laptop. the fast wireless charger is good, but i noticed that over a few hours it wasn't keeping up with the hotspot demands, even though the hotspot was idle. (the wired charger fixed the problem right away). additionally, you have to kind of move the phone around on the charger to get the "sweet spot" where it charges. i would advise that the wireless charger (even the fast wireless charger) is not the fastest solution. additonally, you'll need either a: charging back--which makes using a cover impossible, or a charging case (i chose a charcoal colored case, but it was $60). i could have gotten a white one cheaper, but i like the darker colors better. you don't get other color choices. you'll need a wired charger for the heavy demand apps, like the hotspot. i set the device to work with my fingerprint and a backup password, my s5 wouldn't do that because i put a second glass face on the front of it to protect it. this time i will use a plastic film. the fingerprint scanner is doing it's job. this device comes with android 4.4 (kit kat), but over the course of twelve hours updated itself to marshmallow (android 6). this was kind of a pain because it happened at night. it kept updating the os. i left it on the wireless charger, and it was ok. however, my moto 360 smartwatch is not happy with my phone right now (isn't keeping the right time--it's 2 timezones away) with my phone, and i am working to understand and fix this. i am sure this is the os and not the device. i got this device activated late on a friday (i got in two days, even though the email said 8 days--this was fantastic) , and as i said earlier, i thought the pen was missing (it wasn't, but the device was so slick, i just missed it). this is where it gets good: i emailed the seller directly through amazon, and in 8 minutes (i looked), got a response and a solution from the vendor. unbelievable. no kidding, two minutes later, the vendor shipped a rush order of a new pen (got the tracking number), and deducted a small amount from the purchase price. ( i got the notification). the salesman, eric and i were emailing back and forth on a friday night. i don't think i've ever gotten such terrific customer service. this is a great company--i want to do more business with them. the note took the existing sim from my s5--but--i had to go back and put all my contacts on my sim from the s5 (they existed on the phone, not the sim--who knew?). i got instructions online. i found the pen about 2 hours later, where it should have been, and i was just really embarassed. yes, i could have said nothing and let it go, but that's not honest (and it would have left the impression that the manufacturer was putting out defective equipment) ; i wanted to make it right by this company, so i emailed eric right away to let him know (by this time it was 8:15 pm est), and he responded right away. he was gracious and professional throughout the entire transaction. what company does this on a weekend night? this is a great device--not perfect, but really good. you might think this is a "end all/be all" device with the stylus [i am impressed with it's pinpoint accuracy] ; but working with sites that require passwords, and capcha issues is proving somewhat frustrating and difficult. it's not the device, it's the site. just know going in, you might need more real estate (a bigger screen) to do some real work. it is the best stylus i ever used, hands down. overall, my experience is a big plus; i'm very happy with this device--and you can buy an extended battery for it (i'm thinking about it). the wired charger works very fast; the wireless, not so fast. i can't say enough good things about the company .   perfect phone, like palm pilot? you will love this phone too,. the phone is beautiful and just what i wanted. all i had to do was take it to verizon to have it activated - so easy. it was just as described .   i upgraded from the galaxy s3 to the note, due to the praise one of my coworkers gave theirs. i am completely satisfied with the upgrade. the product came in fine working order, i just did not realize that for the 1st time, i would need a sim card. once that was remedied i have zero complaints .   i was a little nervous buying this online, but it came brand new in the box and worked great. buy with confidence .   been using it for a couple of weeks. not one problem! works great. i am very satisfied .   piece of s***. the phone broken down after 6 months. i called their service line but they say there was nothing that they can do .   it's been over a year now since i purchased this phone and i must say this is by far the best phone i've owned. i am a verizon customer and was eligible for an upgrade so i began looking at my options. until now i have been a faithful droid user but i wasn't impressed with the offerings at the time so i looked at other manufacturers. among many of the other features, i was intrigued by the fact that this phone came with a stylus and decided to give it a try. being a longtime prime customer, i always look to amazon before making a purchase elsewhere and to my delight amazon had this phone for $100. less than i could get it from verizon even with my upgrade promo pricing. this phone is truly a pocket pc, when i'm out of the office i use this phone constantly for work. out of full disclosure, i did just recently purchase a laptop for working in the field but that is only because i need to be able to update projects using adobe premier and illustrator which of course i can't do on this phone. the battery life seems to have diminished a bit but i have so many apps installed and running that is to be expected. i do plug it in every time i'm in my vehicle and i pack a backup usb charger in my edc bag in case of an emergency. the camera and video quality is light years ahead of my old droid razr hd and the time it takes for the camera to initiate and snap a picture or start recording takes only a few moments compared to my old droid. to conclude this review, this is the best phone i've owned and i highly recommend it .   yes i love the phone when i got it for my wife, but after a week of having it she was already having problems .  we contacted about the situation but she didn't want to send the phone back and be without a phone. fits perfect, otterbox the best .   didn't give it 5 stars because i'm returning it. it's defective, i just think this one is broken. overall i actually like it. just my luck .   i love this phone. i don't know what took me so long .   so far i love it great phone. horrible. i love my phone. hopefully we get 5.2 or something other than lolliflop5.1 soon cuz i'm already ready to take the time and wait for an exchange so i can be back on kitkat4.4 .   5.1 full of bugs .   sim card problems right when i attempted to activate it. had to drive to 5 different stores across miami and none had a note 4 sim card which is 206r. i already had two but those didn't register. if this isn't fixed i will return for a refund. because fully operational -as described in the description- should mean i can activate it with sprint . other than sim issues the phone is great. i bought this february 22 and it already quit working right. and as usual there nothing i can do it out of its return window so 400 just went down the drain. this is one of the worse purchases i've made in amazon. i love it. so far so good .   awesome phone. love the stylist. the cord broke where you plug into the phone. loved this phone .   phone looks practical new to me. it activated without any problems, thank you edge cellular .   i do recommend going on ebay and get the sim card for it , sprint stores doesn't carry micro sim anymore  .   love it thank you. wonderful phone, with removeable back. looks and works like new, i just switched from iphone and i will never look back. pics are obviously higher resolution. the screen is huge. expandable memory is awesome. transferring files to and from note are a breeze. no more itunes to have to deal with. ir capable. i can use it as a remote for every ir device in my home. i may opt for a larger battery but that is the only thing close to a con that i have .   phone was so scratched up that when i went to activate it. the lady laughed but hey u get your money's worth. but i'll give it 5 stars because internally the phone was good and it works great but justale sure if u are buying a use phone that they use the real pix of the phone so you can see how much damage you are getting yourself into. bought phone and it is defective. says in the description great condition with barely any signs of use. it looks new but the phone wont work. starts and turns off repeatedly non stop. have yet to see the home screen. do not recommend .   this is definitely the best phone i've ever owned and definitely a computer that has communications built into it. mine is a refurbished model, which means that someone physically checked out everything on it, so i know it will be flawless. i bought the note 4 because it: - has a replaceable battery, so i can have a second for backup or replace as needed the newer note battery is not replaceable. - because it is not the latest and greatest, it was considerably cheaper. it syncs great with my subaru for phone, text and emails and was super link up. i just couldn't be happier. very nice phone. i bought a galaxy note 4 received february 5 i worked fine till an update i. may then it crashed took it to samsung who tried to update it as well now it doesn't work at all was told it was a hardware issue and is after warrantwand can not be replaced by samsung contacted the seller to no response now i have a 400 dollar paper weight i will not be ordering my galaxy note 5 through them don't waste your time or money. i love this phone so much. i can do everything on it. i have had it for several months and have had no problem at all .   love the note 4, i purchased it to replace my original note1, nice upgrade, very satisfied with purchase. no problems at all .   phone was in excellent condition cosmetically. took phone to at&t store to get a sim card, internet would not work at all on the device .   the phone meets my expectation. good battery life and the wind screen that allows me to work as i go .   the phone came exactly as pictured, looks great in white, and is a marked upgrade over my poor, now-defunct razr maxx .   when i first got it .i went to verizon to get a sim card and the worker there activated the phone but with no avail the antenna was not picking up any internet.he told me the software was erased and i should return it.i called verizon tech support they said it could be an antenna issue and phone may be somewhat damaged then he tried to go through the settings with me and i got some internet 2 bars and i was happy .  i informed noble planet and they got back to me and said they would issue a refund and not to contact amazon?i told them well its working now and i would get back to them and was glad they called .  after a couple of days the internet would not connect on wifi or verizon network it would go on a few hours and not work again for several hours.the antenna part or whatever is not responding as should a phone that cost 239 dollars .  i called noble planet and left a message and no return call at all .  i want a refund still waiting for response.this is so unprofessional .   this phone is a great phone. i really love the camera and the stylus. i have not had many problems. the only problem i had was with the battery, it would not hold a charge, but they seller sent me a new battery and it works great! i have taken many photos and they all turned out great. the front facing camera has a built in face tuning software so it helps with hiding blemishes and does it automatically, but you can turn it off if you do not want it. the camera records in 60fps but only at 720p resolution which is still hd and great. i really enjoy many of the features like the stylus quick notes and the back sensors. i use the quick notes a lot when iâ€™m in class and need to jot down a test date or assignment due date. i love the fingerprint sensor, even though a lot of people donâ€™t like it because you have to swipe downwards instead of leaving it in one position like the note 5 or iphone. i love how fast the phone is and itâ€™s great for playing games, watching movies and everything. the 2k screen is amazing, movies, tv shows, youtube and netflix all look great on the screen. the screen is very responsive and fast moving, i actually enjoy the touchwiz ui (user interface). i do not have any complaints about this phone, i really love it and enjoy using it. i love watching 2k videos and viewing 2k pictures on it, the crisp and clear images always surprise me. i highly recommend this phone for anyone who is thinking about getting one .   phone is better than i expected. a+ seller,. this phonies in perfect condition,love it .  ~. i have this note note 4 it has been perfect. it's a great phone. the best i have ever had but now it has become glitch that why i have gave it 5 stars i haven't drop the phone or gotten it wet.i paid too much for it too be acting this,way. was from china. not as advertised, could not be activated by sprint. totally disappointed, was a birthday present. went through sprint for a phone. lost $10 on a glass screen protector installed before attempting to activate. will never go down this road again .   legit delivered as advertised. seller has me a return customer product arrived early no complaints its legit .   im not to happy right now the battery dies so quickly im going to test it out another day and if this stays the same im returning this phone .   the phone works perfectly .   i only regret buying the at&t variant .   brand new looking. works great .   love the phone. it is just like new. phone is great but more chipped in the housing than expected. delivered 3 hours early which was awesome and phone does work great so very thrilled. very good  .   i really like the galaxy note products. this is my third and i am not disappointed. the note 4 is the best balanxe n of performance and price .   phone came on time and works exceptionally well. i bought this phone to connect to my sprint line it had a bad esn not cool. great .   i ordered this after looking into it extensively and love the product. i received it after almost three weeks from the date of order and i was totally enthused by it. i love it as an upgrade from the samsung note 2. i did notice right off the bat that the sound was a little off and i took it as minor offset from from models unaware. i am not a heavy streamer or sound byte guy. some people told me that they had trouble understanding me when i called them and they sounded a little "bl-atty", to me over the phones hands-free speaker. i just played some instructional video on my phones speaker and it was awful. i then had my wife call me with my phone to my house phone and have decided the problem was as if the phone had been dropped in water and not totally refurbished. this would account for both the microphone and speaker on the phone not sounding well. just before i typed this i checked out a friends note 4 and his sounds great compared to mine. other than these issues the phone is great. the problem lies in the quality control ad sine i was sick for several weeks and still working the 13 hour night shift i was out of it and missed the return/warranty date so i am out of luck and can say goodbye to the money spent on this item .   becuz it dies quick. everything i expected it to be .   awesome phone. now i can watch largeandincharge women perform hiddious sex with their mule on a much larger screen. thanks amazon .   phone was received in condition described by gizmotrader. was very surprised to see it come bubble wrapped inside an envelope rather than a box but it seems to have been adequate protection. the phone came complete with s pen, no label nfc ready battery, and generic charger with cable. pen and battery work great. charger, not so much. the charger from a old flip phone charged this phone faster. not a problem though, since it was stated that the charger was a generic one and i was expecting to have to buy a quick charge 2.0 charger anyway. all features of the phone seem to be working and the few issues i encountered were remedied by clearing caches and updating apps. very pleased with this phone .   phone was surprisingly in perfect condition. battery is still good. way exceeded expectations .   great. this a tmobile phone not att. came in original box and packaging. very pleased .   this phone shuts off and then turns back on during a conversation. once the battery is at about 20% there is about a 50/50 shot that the phone will cut off. if i try to turn it back on it just drains the battery to 0% depending on how many times i try to turn it back on. the only way i can turn it back on is if i let it charge for about 30 min (then i am good to go) even if the battery is still at lets say 10% or 15%. this problem would really suck at a time during an emergency. i would have rather purchase a phone with a couple of bumps that actually worked verses paying the extra $150 bucks for a phone that looks nearly untouched yet it is unreliable .   i bought a used phone from gizmo and it works exceptionally well except for a few hiccups once in a while and it overheating alot which i find annoying at times. i don't know if that has to do with the phone itself being used or just a samsung flaw. but otherwise it works very well. the phone came exactly when it said it would and the condition was almost like new with a few minor paint chipping around the edges, almost unnoticeable onless looking very closely. overally i am pleased with this purchase .   replaced my note 3 with this note 4 and glad i did. no longer does pressing the center button at the bottom take you to the magazine which i never used. pressing it takes you to the home screen and holding it down takes you to a google search engine. phone is faster than the note 3 and the battery last much longer than on the note 3. it comes with what appeared to be a new battery but no stylus. my note 3 stylus fit so no issue there .   phone is,defective customer service won't respond screen camera are all defective. good phablet with enough ram to keep me moving. i also like the removable battery and micro sd slot. works well and is fast .   good produt. i wasn't able to activate was looked. i have enjoyed having this phone. excellent picture quality. the phone was in very good condition as well! thanks .   i purchased this phone for my husband as one of his birthday gifts. my husband truly loves this phone more then the remainder gifts he received from the family. it was delivery on time. i want to thank you so much for delivering on time. refurbished phone is great so far. only disappointing thing is that the rapid charger included didn't work at all. seller did not answer my email about it .   this is a great phone. easy to use and a remarkable camera .   firstly, i purchased this to replace a note4 that i broke the screen on. it arrived and i was impressed that it was in perfect condition. could have been new. i charged it and when i turned it on, that's where my disappointment began. it was in chinese. once i figured out where to get it to english, i saw that it was a different version of android (5.0.1 - vs - 5.1.1 on mine) .   mot a biggie but it also didn't look like the version that was on my phone prior to update. so i went to update the phone, .   great, .   verizon says it's already updated and it can't go any higher. hmm. odd build number also, .   "dongchau" or something like that (travelling and don't have the pics in front of me). also, .   will not log into verizon lte (makes sense, no lte officially in china yet) lte does not even show as an option in networks. just logs into cdma. outside of settings, .   it will show 4g, .   4 bars at an awesome 1mb speeds .   where my broken phone will show 24-30 mbs or so in the same spots (multiple throughout my town). so, .   being inquisitive, i take this to my verizon office. they run some tests on my phone, .   then the same on this new phone i got from this vendor. lo and behold,. they can't get the phone to accept and lte connections, .   and as we look through settings notice that it's different hardware sensors. i relay all of this to the vendor and get the canned "we do not sell chinese phones". oh, .   and google play does not install (not used in china, they use baidu) i do a factory reset before i send i back and it resets (all 5 times) to shanghai. so, .   while the phone was in gorgeous shape, .   it was probably because these crooks just had it made. buyer beware .   i received a samsung galaxy note 4 charcoal black 32 gb it is just what they said it was an i am pleased with the phone. this phone is awesome. the screen size of the phone made it comfortable to use so i wouldn't need my tablet every time i wanted to look at a videos or do a little reading in my spare time. it's definitely a good phone to use for your car as a navigation system without the need to get closer to see the directions. i didn't easily run out of space either like my old phone. i could record as many videos, take pictures, write notes, without the need for an sd card right away; the expandable memory is a plus just in case i ever need it. i love the camera quality on the front and back, the back takes crystal-clear photos and videos, and the front facing camera is excellent when it comes to doing video chats, and for those selfie-takers out there. the apps such as the activity logs is a nice feature for the phone, since i do a lot of walking and like to keep track of how many miles i walk as well as check my heart rate, oxygen concentration, etc. the battery life for the phone is actually a lot better than i expected it to be considering its size. i'm a heavy user, so it really was surprise to see that the phone could last the day and even past that after playing games and videos with it. there were a couple of times after work that i would forget to charge it and it still had enough battery to get me going the next day. i probably could've made it the 2 days if i didn't charge it. overall a really nice phone with excellent capabilities for those that are inclined toward phablets. looking forward to using samsung's other products .   very good .   it was what i expected .   phone came and it was locked . i had to send it back. phone came with a scratch on the screen. disappointed in that. wife is very happy with her new phone. even though the phone looked and worked great. it would not activate under the sprint network even though it said sprint compatible .   said it was sprint not sprint .   good phone great deal .   camera lens breaks too easily, wi'll be reselling this phone, it's not worth butting at all. does not come with sim card, best buy had one for 5.00 and the sprint rep worked with sprint for an hour to get it traded with the one i bought through amazon for 17.00 .   that arrived locked  .  useless! but phone is as represented, new in sealed box. good deal .   i absolutely loved this phone. it is the only phone i didn't knit pick to death right away. i'll start with the obvious, the screen. by far the most gorgeous panel out there. the s-pen took no time at all to get used to,having multi-window capability was awesomely useful. let me stop and say i am a dedicated apple user, more from need than choice. i live in a rural area where you take the mark of the "big red" beast or use two tin cans and a string.(if you are under 50 you probably don't know what i am talking about. ask grandpa) i loved the note's capabilities, but verizon in typical fashion has not updated to marshmallow yet, no support for wifi calling and wifi calling is the deal breaker. i am confined to my home and mainly a wheelchair. on a great day i get three bars of 1x data, and if i roll to the western side of the house, i can actually make 1 in every 7or8 calls without dropping the call. if you think you might like this handset jump on it you won't be sorry. i wish i could get a gsm signal and try that version of this phone .   i bought the samsung note 4 because i loved the note 3. this device has amazing graphics and great stereo sound. i have used iphones, lg's, htc m9 and note 3. samsung, as a whole, far surpassed all the other devices in speed,design and function .   its a great phone but remember its not unlocked, it will be another fee to unlock! it is worth it though i should tell you .   nicely sealed package and good to have additional s pen tips .   i was a little hesitant to purchase this phone. but once i received it i was happy . open the box awsome condition just like new. came with everything a new one would except headphones. but who cares i use my beats anywho .   awsome phone would gladly purchase another one. ðÿ‘. although i love the note 4 i received .  the battery is going from full charge to 0 and then completely shutting off. not sure if this is a phone issue or a battery issue. i will give it a few days .  hopefully purchase a new battery and it fixes itself. update. the new battery did not work. this phone is not fully functional as described. the phone itself is amazing, but the charger i received with my phone does not work at all .   phone looks great and seems to work perfectly. i haven't had a single problem with the os,etc. as of yet. however, i was told by my service provider that something activated a water exposure device inside of it. as a result, i had no choice but to pay for a monthly cell phone insurance plan .   worth every dollar. horrible battery life .   won't even last 2 hours. works great and it came earlier than promised. a great phone .   it's awesome .   battery life amazing  .   over all .   phone is perfect, condition is like new .   perfect replacement for my water damaged phone. came in excellent condition just as described. price was great .   love it. i love it. does a super job for me .   i'm real happy with this, it's almost perfect condition and works great so far. i broke my note 3 and this is way better than paying 25$ a month for their new stupid pay by month plans plus 11$/month insurance and huge deductibles .   great phone .   no good. slightly hesitant about buying a phone from here. especially seeing how cheap it was. but i've had the phone for a week and seems to be working perfectly. works as if brand new. edges show some wear, but that's what the case is for. overall, great phone for a great price .   better than my new galaxy s 5, ez to use & good used prices, mine cost 274.00 best to buy phones this way. plan to next phone note 5 later used .   love my phone .   works great and like new. love it. i can't begin to tell you how pleased i am with this phone! i intentionally waited 2 weeks to see if there were any mishaps in the functionality of the phone and i gotta tell ya .  it functions like new. the battery life was just fine although i purchased extra batteries and a spare portable battery charger because i never want it to die. the only con i have is that you can tell that it's used. there were a couple of tiny dent dings on the back, several scrapes around the edges and 1 small scratch on the bottom right side of the screen. not very noticeable. other than that, i purchased an otterbox and plan on having this phone for a while. the features on this phone remind me of my apple mac .  you're always learning new things about it no matter how old! amazing phone .  amazing vendor .   i appreciate a new phone at a low price but the phone does at 15% .   received item as described ,very happy with it. this will be the only phone i purchase off amazon.com. the phone is freezing all the time. the charging port came damaged. i needed a phone asap for work. never again $200 and something just gone. i'm not happy at all .   excellent. love it arrived on time and the best phone iveever had ðÿ“±ðÿ“±â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸. excellent smartphone .   i ordered a phone and it doesnt even work, it keeps rebooting for no reason .   big scratch on front. refurbished is the way to go. 1/3 the price of new and after the case is installed .  no one knows. thanks jr mobile world for saving me a bundle .   there service is fast. return the first samsung galaxy note 4 (at&t) due to screen burns because these phones must be on all the time at a particular display, only to received the replacement with screen burn. i had a samsung galaxy note 4(sprint) for over a year and there was never any screen burns. i don't think anyone wants a cellphone with screen burn and they act like it is no big deal. just saying .   best phone i've ever purchased. been using it since it came out, it's fast and lasts forever. i could do without the silly pen, it serves no purpose. i don't see me needing a new phone until the note 7 comes out .   fast delivery, looks new, completely happy with phone and works .   i'm happy with my purchase. a+++. great product fast shipping .   the battery dies at 20%. battery issues .   the antenna has issues poor signal strength. i love this phone! i can write notes, turn them into text and send them to my email to save time with note taking. i like using the s-pen for transcribing and texting. i can edit photos and physically draw on them. the photo quality is great although the camera lens broke within a couple weeks and i'm unsure how that happened however, for $6 on amazon, it was an an easy fix. i use my phone a lot: texting, surfing the internet, taking photos, creating basic forms, taking, etc. and the battery is decent-for excessive use i usually have to charge it by 1pm (7 hours later with heavy sporatic use). i'm going to gift one to my other half. so happy with this purchase .   love it. arrived in perfect condition .   owned a couple of smart phones galaxy 2 pantech discover and iphone 4. the galaxy 4 note is the best. beautiful colors plenty of apps and fast processor. the 3 gig of ram and 32 gig storage are a bonus. love the phone and highly recommend. almost forgot 5.7 inch screen is a plus for me due to my poor eyesight .   great phone! i had no problems with the phone or the seller. price was great and i'm totally happy with this buy. i will buy again from this compay .   i love it. i bought this phone used and hoped for the best. i'm very pleased with my purchase which was described as very good condition was in excellent condition and is working great in all respects .   i've been very pleased with this phone so far, the camera is great, the screen is very clear and east to read, if you like big phones, this is the phone for you. i've had a few times where the screen would just go black, but it's just the app closing down, so i'm not sure about that. the phone had little to no scratches, in great condition. i'm glad i got it! and such a good price, too .   the phone was really great at first but after 2 weeks the mic goes and now i have to figure out what to do .   came exactly as promised, looks and runs like it's brand new. came earlier than expected. i would buy from them again .   for a used phone it is in excellent condition. everything seems to be working so for. i'm using straight talk sim card with this phone, i love it. i will order from this company in the future if anything goes well .   i was a bit weary about making this purchase since my last online purchase of a used phone went horribly. i was also worried because there were no pictures available to look at of this phone and the description was generic. but i am happy to note that this phone works flawlessly and is in excellent condition. the screen had a few very small hardly noticeable scratches (i had to hold it at an angle in the light with the screen black), but the body and edges look great like it had been in a case the whole time it was used. it also came with the usb cord and wall plug in. i spend a great deal of time shopping around online for this phone looking for an affordable price, but also being careful to avoid the same problem i had previously. i only paid $10 than i did for the phone i had previously purchased from another site and it was physically damaged terribliy and had internal issues. this seller is great and replied to my email about my concerns letting me know the return poilicy if i was not pleased, something else i struggled with with the other company. amazon is the best and so is this seller! i now know who i will go through for my future used cell phone purchases .   love it .  ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ’–ðÿ‘œðÿ˜. the home button don't work and it doesn't say that in the description so i have to return it .   the phone looks great but i never got a battery for it. i thought it came with one i guess i have to order one .   awful! we bought the note 4 and it was in horrible condition. has all kinds of dents, cracks, scuffs, holes etc all over the phone and nowhere in the description did it say any wear or tear. also when i was on the phone with anyone i can barley hear the person on the other line i thought it was the first phone call or the other person so i tried again and nope it was terrible. i guess i learned my lesson when buying a phone off of amazon and it will never again happen! very disappointed customer and will not make this mistake again. and the phone did not come with a charger or headphones like a normal phone should come with .   now it seems small .  otherwise ok. loooooove it! bought it used had a lt of scratches on the rims. description said it has few to none .   pretty good. i like this phone. however i do have a conflict between it being too large and too small. i like the largeness of it obviously for optical reasons of reading news and information. it is easier to read stuff and watch videos on. but when it comes to actual phone use and unexpected events, i can't handle this phone with one hand. i am conflicted but in general i think my next phone will be smaller .   came in good condition and worked right on start up .   can be a little buggy but to be expected buying an older used phone. got this used and looks brand new out the box and works very snappy and fast .   love it. ended up returning because it wouldn't keep a signal and dropped 2 out of 3 calls. i can't have that nor can anyone else. other phones in the same spot didn't do that, so i know it was the phone. tried to connect to different networks and it didn't help. very disappointed. so much for samsung! will stick with lg for half the price .   perfect! came in exactly as advertised "like new"! only complaint would be the pen the tip just doesn't feel right, my recommendation would be edge cellular those guys know what they're selling .   i decided to switch back to android after using an iphone for 1+ years. the difference is wow. i love the qhd screen,it's very easy to read, outshines my ios device screens. i get a full day on battery with heavy usage and 2 days with lighter use. the current lollipop os is a huge improvement over kitkat. i purchased this on amazon marketplace, the phone is in like new condition.i also purchased the fast adaptive charger from samsung, here on amazon. it charges to full charge in 1.5 hours. also, the fast charge will charge the battery from 0-5% to 60+% in 30 minutes. quite the handy feature. a great phone .   so far so good; performs as advertised .   great phone. plenty of space. i have it for at&t and tey do not have the wi-fi calling enabled. that is my only complaint. i actualy ended up buying a total of three of these phones. havings a samsung tv, we use the screenshare a lot .   very very very happy. the phone looked and works like new .   great. no complaints here .   wow this phone was perfect. no scratches or dents, or even a cracked screen. works perfect with at&t. just go to your local at&t store and get your free sim card (must have at&t to get it free). i've owned many of samsung's phones because their great phones. i have always bought them new because the one and only time we bought it used we got a phone that completely died after 2 months of regular use. i bought the note 4 brand new from this seller and i'm just a little disappointed. the battery seems to be defective since one split second it goes from 14% battery to 0% and turns off. that's not so bad in my book because i can always just buy another battery. however, i can't manage to plug in headphones into my phone. my whole family has samsung galaxy phones so i try to plug in their headphones and it won't go in all the way. i've used a flashlight to look into it i don't see anything lodged inside. now when i looked to see if i can file a complain it seems they've already sold out of new note 4's so a replacement isn't looking like a possibility. the phone works great. no scratches so i can tell it's brand new. the headphone jack is the only issue so far .   perfect, works great, long battery life can use from sun up til sun down then pop it on the charger while i sleep and its good to go again ( actually can full charge from 20% to 100% in abut a hour or just over even on my usb unit in the truck when i wont be back as/when intended ) love using it for movies and news since the screen quality is so great, the only thing that really destroys the battery usage is recording in 2k-4k which also eats memory but that is pretty expected, 1080p does not hurt the battery life near as much and you wont need a massive memory upgrade like you do for the 4k .   the sound quality from the speaker phone and wireless headset is not very good .   very happy, good price. my phone broke in an unexpected accident falling out of a moving vehicle to the ground into water puddle, and broke the screen and destroyed phone. i was able to be up and running with all my info apps and contacts within 2 days. i activated an old flip phone for two days, and learned that i'd never go back to that again .   i love the phone it is awesome .   breed the place that is selling it does not have good customer service though. i ended up having to go drive two hours to pick it up at the ups store cause the messed up .   love love love this phone. i received my phone today and it was exactly as described in physical condition. i have placed heavy use on it in the last 12 hours and so far the performance is meeting and exceeding my expectations. shipping was fast and product was well packaged and i would definitely recommend this amazing phone to anyone who wants a phone that offers a big screen with great display, excellent productivity features, and somewhat user-friendly interface. love it. as listed, this gently used samsung galaxy note 4 was in like new cond. woohoo ! love it. purchased it for the 16 pixel camera and the loud/crisp speakers when i listen to movies and youtube music and it did not disappoint. only downsize is battery life. but i plan to get a battery piggy back case to increase this so no problem really .   if i didn't know any better, i woulda thought this was a brand new phone. freaking love this phone and it even came in early, even tho i missed the mailman/ups guy. best buy that i've made on amazon .   an outstanding purchase. one thing needs a operations manual that give more information than the get started sheet .   love it. it was in excellent condition. works well .   it was listed as previously owned, however once it arrived it was brand new .   i bought this phone for $200 bucks .  i was very happy .   very good phone. i was cocerned but it worked great! the battery was swelled a bit. overall very pleased since my old phone was stolen and much cheaper than buying out right .   i purchased a white refurbished att note 4 .   being a refurbished i knew it was a used phone that was rebuilt .   mine did have a couple nicks on the sides .   nothing a case wouldnt cover. and the s pen was a little beat up .   but i can always buy a new s pen and the price would still be way cheaper than a new note 4 .   i have not had any trouble with it as of yet.i have only had it a few days. mine came with phone and a charger and head phones .   arrived without a scratch, but there are app icons burned into the screen. only noticeable on white backlight but really annoying. there's a tiny scratch across the top, but other than that it works great .   has a cracked screen. phone was in okay conditio. was fine about it since i paid not that much but worse thing was speaker for phone was not working :( so every call i recieved that day thought i was hanging up on them .  worst experience. phone shipped as expected. phone is in very good condition, love it .   i am happy with this phone, even tho it's second hand, i haven't got to use it for long yet, cause i just got it, but first when i got it my hand and set it everything up .   oh man it's great handle. great color, big screen, easy to type. and more features. best phone for very good money .   description said it was for sprint it actually from china telecome carrier. we tried to activate in our sprint plan and it wouldn't work .   very upsetting.especially when my fiance was excited about this phone. if i had a choice i wouldn't even rate this 1 star .   received as described. nice transactions .   excellent. phone came exactly as described. no problems activating the phone with verizon wireless. beautiful phone, absolutely beautiful, it looks brand new, no cosmetic flaws, at all .   works well. great. i love it! bought two. only thing that sucked is one of the chargers came broken. but overall, the phones were great .   bought this phone used on here, i've had it a little over a week! so far works great. only had a few small scratches on the screen. very nice phone, i upgraded from the note 3 .   i like the note 4 and all work well for me .   don't get me wrong, the phone itself is a great product, but of your thinking of flashing it to boost mobile, you can't. tried once i received the package, and they told me no .   updated review after having my phone for 2 months. the phone now resets itself when i lay down the phone. happens 3 out of 5 times for no reason. not a user error, it's a phone error. i have a case around the phone so the vibration from me placing it on a flat surface is minimal. need it replaced. will find out soon. below is my first review: i was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but the cost out weighed the risk. a new note 4 is close to $700 after tax. this was less than half the price so it was well worth trying it out. phone had a few minor scratches on the glass and the frame, no big deal. i expected the phone to have a slower processor than a new phone, i was surprised, i cant tell if it's slower, which is a good thing. it did have an application that i was so frustrated with which i finally figured out "peel remote". this leaves a transparent remote control on your screen and if clicked, it will freeze your screen. you need to delete or deactivate it to get rid of it (youtube). i'm happy with the phone but only time will tell if the processor slows down significantly .   horrible phone. i bought this phone for my wife in 2014 and wasted a ton of money on a handset that died just past the warranty period. will never buy another samsung ever again. i have tried having two diferent at&t stores look at the device and neither have been able to fix it. what a waste. i have never had any issues with any of my iphones that i have owned since 2007. cheaply built phone .   no issues with the phone so far.i got my phone within four days of being shipped which was pretty good .   i like the features on the phone the only problem i had is the battery seems to overheat a lot and the charge doesnt last too long so i brought me an brand new battery which i dont mind doing cause i rather have an brand new battery anyways. great two layer hybrid case .   i bought refurbished, enjoyed the phone for about a week and then it stopped working. i absolutely love the note 4 so after i receive my money back i think i am going to try again and get "like new" &from a different seller .   after buying our (special needs and deaf) daughter 4 phones, she finally convinced us to get this galaxy note 4. now she is in constant contact with her friends. i can't say enough about it .   great product and great company. happy to do business with. fast delivery and phone as described. thank you  .   love this phone .   love it .   omg .   i'm in love .   this phone is fantastic. it came nearly 2 days ahead of schedual. i was worried about activating it but that went just as smooth as its operation. i couldn't be happier with the device. overall buy this phone .   so far, so good  .   working just as expected. sractches all over the phone and it didn't come with a charge or headphones, just the phone. definitely not brand new don't recommend buying from this guy. bad battery sent with phone. great product .   great phone. i have had an iphone 5 for over a year. while i loved the look and feel, i wasn't happy with the user experience. before the iphone i had an htc one mini and i liked the customization. it was endless. going to the iphone was a major step down in that department. i know customization isn't as important to some people, but it is to me. i realized this too late. i finally got fed up and started looking into the note series. i have a tab a tablet that i bought for school and i loved it so much. i was happy to research the note series. after struggling with the note 4 and 5, i decided that a glass back, though it looked nicer, wasn't going to matter because i would have a case on the phone most of the time. my note 4 (verizon) arrived today and i'm so happy with it. i'll update my review if things change; i've watched a lot of video reviews and know what to watch out for with this phone. i've already noticed that the fingerprint swipe is nearly impossible to do with a case on the phone. at least, the case i purchased to protect my phone from drops. there's also lag when pushing the active apps button. in pretty much every way i've noticed so far, this is a great upgrade from the iphone 5. camera is better, customization is better, keyboard is uglier but easier to use, and i find google now better than siri .   great  .   the phone itself is decent though with lollipop the battery is much worse than my old note 2 with jellybean. for those using it greenify does wonders for battery life. however i did not realize before buying it that there is no way to get permanent root access to the phone. if i had known this the moto x pure would have been a better choice. still it will work well for me until i find a better phone and when i am done with it it will become our all-in-one remote control for home. not a bad value just not quite what i had hoped for .   came very fast and had no issues, love it .   it was perfect for me. was in great shape, works good. i love it .   thank you. i ðÿ’˜ this phone. gave it to my daughter as a birthday gift in july 2015. the external speaker does not work and it does not recognize an external flash card. i searched online and applied all known fixes from powering on and off, removing and replacing the battery and completely resetting the device. the headphone aspect works but the external speaker does not. avoid purchasing this phone. i purchased this phone new on amazon .   i use this phone and works great love it. fast shipping awesome phablet. i have used this phone for a few months now and at first i was a bit bothered by the size. now i can't understand why i ever had a small phone! the screen shows a crisp and clear picture and the camera is by far the best i've ever experienced on a phone. i have not had any software issues yet. i will note that the phone that i got was t-mobile unlocked to work on at&t. i was not thrilled at that because i thought i was going to get a at&t phone but it works just fine. even the free wifi from at&t works when you are in public .   phone was a great price! you couldn't even tell it was used. it was in perfect shape. thank you .   so far so good, i love this phone. with the right app, you can conserve battery life w/o comprising visual quality and function. i got it used from goodcellas and they described it as used / in good or very good condition and it was in excellent condition. there was the tiniest of superficial scuffs in an obscure spot and you can't even see it. the phone looks brand new. i've been using it for a couple of weeks and i love it. i'm very happy with the seller and happy with the phone. it even arrived a day earlierâ€‹ than expected .   best phone ever. best seller ever. just got my galaxy note 4 and the camera is cracked! will change this when they fix this problem. update great phone once they sent on that worked. still have it. was very nice , was not unlock had to return it. product arrived late, but vendor refunded my expedited shipping with no hassle. phone works great and looks and feels brand new .   i've been using this phone for three weeks now. it's a bit large but the screen size is very easy on my eyes. operations are very quick and i appreciate having the 3 gb of memory. haven't used the stylus yet, but i have used one on the note 10.1, so i believe it will work the same. this is a refurbished phone and despite some scratches on the back surface, it looks good. i have housed it in a decent case to protect it, which added some weight, but overall i am very pleased with this phone. the applications work well. i especially like the small footprint of the telephone app that appears with incoming calls when i'm in another app. call quality is excellent. the only short-coming i've noticed is the size of this phablet is at the extreme edge of what i would consider useful as a phone .   i give this seller thumbs up. phone was in great condition just as promised. i would have gave 5 stars but my stylus kept saying dettached when it was attached, and it sounded like singing is loose inside of it. but that's not a issue. phone looks good, works good .   i got just what i wanted thanks. very happy with this purchase phone arrived in perfect condition. bought for girlfriend -- she loves this phone/tablet. phone calls are clear and response is very good .   received this a lot faster than expected. it was scheduled to arrive on wednesday but it came the saturday before! i did tons of research before purchasing this phone and looked all over for a seller i felt i could trust and i don't feel disappointed (igadgets electronics on amazon marketplace). everything came as described in the description with the exception of the very minute things i describe below. it really looks brand new! the phone fits my needs because i did the research and feel like i was an "informed buyer". so, if i don't like something on the phone it is my own fault unless it is a hardware error. i knew coming into this that it could be laggy and battery life may not be what i would say is extra lengthy with my type of use (moderate to heavy). so, with that being said, here is what i have experienced: first thing out of the box it was totally 0% on battery, which i expected and am not complaining .  just stating a fact. i got the cords out which look brand new and plugged it in. nothing happened. i left it for ten minutes on the charger .  nothing. i changed outlets, tested outlets with other chargers, etc. after it was all said and done i found out the base of the charger works but not the cord. no biggie .  it happens. (in the seller's defense, i have not contacted them regarding this. i think this was out of their control as i have bad luck with buggy charging cords the whole time i have been a samsung user.) so, after i switched the cord for one i borrowed from my son (samsung galaxy s5 active user) it started charging. after about ten minutes it had around 20% battery, 20 minutes 40% battery, and 30 minutes with 58% battery! very impressed! after 50% it seemed to charge a bit slower. i believe it is what it is supposed to do though and not a malfunction of any kind. i did not turn it on until i had 60% battery and i left it plugged in. it started right up and initiated the setup process. no issues with the setup at all. very easy. i spent the rest of the day playing. in playing around i noticed the lag here and there, experienced freezing up on two games, and was totally booted out of one game. i also noticed that the speaker had a crackling sound to it. that is something i had not expected and am not too excited about, but again i haven't contacted the seller because i bought used and if the only thing wrong is a crackling speaker at the top 1/4th of volume level i am fine with that. i use headphones 99.9% of the time anyway. overall i am happy with my purchase and am glad i picked this seller (igadgets electronics from amazon marketplace) .   fun to use and the cases that come with it are just amazing. if you enjoy long battery life and debating if you want this or the note 5 i say this is way better at battery life .   arrived in perfect condition and has functioned flawlessly after charging .   i love this phone. it is light and thin, and just the right size. my battery routinely lasts longer than a day with regular daily use (mostly reddit throughout the day). the s-pen is very accurate, though personally i do not use the note taking functions much. my only gripe is that the at&t version cannot be rooted and looks like will not be possible ever, so if you rely on root, then this is not the version for you .   i ordered this as a replacement phone and i honestly was expecting something to be wrong with the phone or not be as expected, but that was not the case. the phone only needed a sim card and activated smoothly. seller was great. this is my 3rd note series and i would say this is the best smartphone (phablet) so far in my humble opinion. my account is setup with verizon and here are some positives: it has 2 radios which help talk and text (surf) at the same time when one is not on 4g/lte network or wifi, new note 5 cannot do that. that is one of the many reasons i did not upgrade to note 5, due to 5â€™s limitations when not on 4g/wifi. secondly, the battery is removable - a big plus (unlike note 5). another feature that i really like is having the sd memory card access/slot, it can be maximized to 64g, some have claimed to 128g (not sure though). battery life is awesome, lasts 2 days with light use. as for dislikes: i wish samsung would update the firmware more frequently. the android 5.1 was released by google around march/apr 2015 and just made it thru to users just few days before writing of this post. i think these sentiments probably are common among many users. new samsung phones do not have removable battery or sd card, so this is probably one of the last phones that we'll see with these features available .   great price. the condition was excellent and it works perfect. i have owned all of the notes 2,3,5,4. i like the 2 and 4 the best. i returned the note 5 after i used the camera it took grainy pics, and it had horrible video playback .   this note 4 is just an awesome phone. i am very pleased .   as discribed. almost look new. the mic don't work so well on speaker phone. it is a refurbished product .   bought this device thinking it would be heavily used .   but to my surprise it looked in very good condition. all works as stated and activated on sprint flawlessly. excellet job! will buy more products in the future .   i haven't had any problems with this phone the esn was clean like the seller said so no problems with activating it with sprint, so i do recommend this seller if your looking for a good used phone. now with that being said remember this is a used phone so i might some wear on it. my phone have two scratches on the side of it but besides that the phone is great .   i am happy with this purchase. it came in good packing, and looked flawless. i have an otterbox case as the phone is big,and thus prone to damage during falls. it's been almost a month, and there are no issues with this phone .   best phone i've ever owned, if you like android samsung is the way to go .   i pove the s pen, hands down the best feature, but also the only reason why i would consider buying a samsung device again. i love the large screen and the functions are really nice. but the phone performs very sluggish. lags with switching of apps and running of certain programs. to my surprise the battery does not last long at all. i find it reaching 15% and then instantly dying. and my father has the same phone with the same issue, needing to replace his. i feel that this is just a rushed out product by samsung. with the nexus performing so much better, it's hard to choose samsung over it. the only thing that keeps me wanting the note is the s pen and it's easy note taking ability .   great phone. works amazing .   awesome phone great battery life. this is my 2nd phone i have ordered from this pangea deals. phone was actually better than described, very pleased and will order from them when i'm ready to upgrade again .   purchased as a used and if not aware of that, i would have assumed to be new. it did however come packaged with a white stylus .   this is the best phone i've ever had .   love the phone. excellent condition. couldn't be happier .   best phone ever! love the size and the features are second to none!i have had many cell phones and this was by the far the best of them all ,including my iphone!came very quickly and was as described! so far no issues, watching battery life though! i wiill update after a couple of months .   great phone no cosmetic wear. great price. the screen is so beautiful! the stylus is squared and not round. that bugged me a little initially but it's so easy to hold and doesn't slip at all. i love that there's a setting that alerts you if you leave the stylus behind and the stylus screen controls make it so easy to take a screenshot and mark it up and share it. mine note 4 came from at&t (which i sort of love ever since they become the "new" at&t). it's got a bunch of at&t and samsung apps on it that you cannot get rid of without rooting the phone and voiding the warranty. but  .   so far there's been plenty of room for packing it full of other apps that i actually do use. the phone is big  .   maybe too big for a lot of people. i went to the at&t store and checked out the size and the feel of it before ordering it from amazon. for me, the screen is large enough to use as my standard kindle device and i do a lot of reading and web browsing on it. i basically use it as a little bitty laptop when i don't need a full size keyboard. the fingerprint unlock feature is fantastic. it takes gorgeous, high res pictures. you do have to pull the back cover in order to get to the sd card so if you switch your card a lot that might get old. on the other hand the cover comes off and goes on really easily. much improved design. it just snaps in place and you don't really have to fit any little tabs into anything .   i bought an "like new" phone that acts like one about to die. it freezes and loses network all the time, which was never an issue before .   perfect. this shouldn't even be a phone. don't listen to your friend when they tell you to switch from an iphone to this just so you can draw stupid stuff on snapchat with the stylus. i promise it's only fun for about 5 minutes .   hands down best phone i've used from an iphone 5s. i'm in love with this phone really nice and neat, my kids love it for games too .   i have had 5 smartphones over the years and this one is definitely the best one i have owned. the favorite feature is the camera. takes incredible pictures even in low light. the only other "cell phone" camera that takes as good of a picture is the sony xpheria z3. love the 5.7" display and streaming video's on it is a lot of fun. using the pen takes a little time getting used to but i rarely use it. still a neat tool to have. i have been using it for a year now and the battery life is great. trick is to turn location services off if you want the battery to last even longer. i will most probably upgrade to the note 6 next year when it comes out. attaching a picture of nyc taken from top of one world trade center after sunset .   [white note 4 case] - okay this case is almost perfect. i really like the texture of the material it's made out of because it's easy to hold onto but still slides in your back pocket with ease. easy to put the phone in the case and all ports were accessible. i felt my phone was safe if i dropped it on a hard surface or something. the only problem was the color. it's not white-white, it's more like off-white. that might be okay on a black phone, but on my white phone you can see the difference. also would be worried it would pick up more color from my dark jeans or the inside of my purse. i rotate between this case and another case i bought on amazon .   very impressed with the quality of the phone! husband is very happy with it. it was his christmas present from me .   have had samsung phones now for a couple of years, previously owned htc devices. love the s-pen, and the fact it has removable battery and a microsd slot. the 32gb standard memory is great too, all my previous devices had 16gb (or less). takes great pics and videos, great in-app editing and touch up as well .   wonderful phone, my wife loves it, simply swapping sim cards from her previous phone brought it up on verizon .   nice looking phone but had defect in battery or power circuit. this was a refurb like new. i would stick with new devices if you can afford and find. the note 4 is a great phone. i love, love, love this phone! absolutely nothing wrong with it and no visible wear/scratches .   looks just like new. i like that i can swap batteries and add memory to my phone. excellent phone .   great phone at a great price. the phone is great and so are the features. the only problem i have with the phone is that it doesn't have smart rotation (where it reads your eyes to determine the orientation of the screen ie. landscape or portrait) and it sometimes vibrates for no reason but it doesn't bother me enough to give the phone a 20% reduction in rating. satisfied satisfied! i'm very happy with these guys! perfect phone great deal .   i was very disappointed in this product. i found it for a good price but when i tried to activate it i could not. i was sold a phone with a financial hold on it. you would think they would do a better job since they had such good reviews. i would not recommended you buy one unless you want to get a useless phone cuz that is what i got .   product was advertised as excellent like new condition. small defects happen small scr as the in the screen happen. but my phone has a large gash over the home key this is not excellent condition. it would be good and used condition i would have givin 5 stars for any defects other than screen defects .   it was as good as new without the box. very nice .   very satisfied. counterfeit phone using a duplicate imei. stay away .   love it. i really like this phone. just as described. no problem .   this phone was just as described and i have no complaints about it at all. i will use this seller if i get more phones like this again .   very nice wife loves it. i have been using this phone for a year now. i like it a lot, but i do have trouble hearing on it sometimes. that might be do to the otterbox, but can be frustrating. other than that i love the phone and its functionality .   perfecto. have had the phone for less than three months. it appeared new, but little issues are now cropping up making me wonder if it was refurbished. when on a call, it will start making a noise like i am mashing one of the numbers. it does this out of the blue but not consistently. the apps will disappear off of the screen and i have to replace them. sometimes the screen is unresponsive and i have to push the buttons over and over to get a response. it also seems to lose contact with my wi-fi when at home. my old galaxy iii never did that. unfortunately, i am outside my window to return so i have no idea how to get service on the phone. feel like i am stuck with a lemon. don't think i would purchase this type of item from warehouse deals again. just don't feel like i got the real deal .   great phone so far, not sure if it was brand new as stated on the listing. the stick on protective covering on the back was off but in the box and there were no earbuds in the box at all. my husband purchased the same phone thru our wireless provider and it came with earbuds .   i bought this note 4 for my wife since i love mine. she needed a replacement for her galaxy iii which was getting tired and has a much smaller screen. she loves the note 4 with it's large screen and snappy response .   awesome. i love it. i have this phone since february 2015. replaced my i-phone 5. i am a real estate agent, in our profession, iphone more common. some new, young agents started using android, and raved about it, so i tried. very easy to use, so many features, love the pull out pen, easier to type, take down (write) people's name and number or take a note. no need to do anything but write, yellow sticky note save itself. everything is simple. taking pictures; highest quality even lower settings. i use to only do "auto" on my iphone, now i actually using different settings easily. the size of the phone is awesome. texting is much better, more feature, for example, you can actually discard a certain text, which i tried that once on my iphone 5 and deleted the whole history with that person .   send and receive e mail and open pdf or pictures to view is great on my galaxy note 4, over all, i am very happy. i was pleasantly supersized that a cheaper phone could beat the iphone in quality! i bought in on amazon, (brand new) with verizon upgrade eligibility, only paid $200! phone conversations are clear, everything loads up fast, on wifi or 4g lte. when home or office, switches automatically to wifi. the option and ease of settings is awesome. charging takes less time, it has speed charger. had no problem with anything so far .   great phone great battery great pics and lighting fast. s-pen enough said .   awesome!  .   love it! coming from samsung exhilarate, huge change .   love it. like new .   wasnt the right phone at all but not their fault it was mine i should of read it right. sorry. the samsung galaxy note 4 looks excellent and works great .   love the phone, camera sucks .   great. the phone works well but when it says that you can tell that it has been used, it has been used. the charging port is beat up and there are a lot of dings on it. but still very functional .   on time. as described. no issues .  not 'new' but pretty close, for condition. thank you. ;). the phone powers of on its own. speaker is choppy. callers can not hear me clearly qhen talking through the speaker phone .   the phone came in great shape. i am very pleased with it .   phone was defective won't go pass the home screen. love it. when the note 5 came out, i got this phone .  it's basically the note 5 with exception of removable battery and sd card .  best phone out there. at first this device was good but that lasted only for about 2 or 3 months. after that everything went down hill. the phone starting to glitch it does not work smoothly any more and it is not like i am asking the phone to do anything hard too. the thing that is the worst is the battery it promises a really great battery but this one is awful. my batter went for 40 to 3% in less then a minute for not reason. i suggest that you never buy this phone even thought it has some really cool features. i wish i could go back to my old iphone .   a great current gen phone for the price. display is vibrant and is the star of the show. built in ir blaster was a nice surprise and can control nearly any ir input device including my ac and my hdmi 5 port switch .   i've owned one of these for going on 2 years now. very fast, large display, and the pen makes it a more usefull device than anything else on the market .   as described. i'm so glad i got this phone .   the sylus is amazing! the phone does so much .   maybe my lg before this was so terrible that this phone is like heaven, but i love it .   love it. very buggy .   i have had it for 3 months and have about had enough .   it works well, however i cannot use this device as a phone because the seller has an outstanding balance so its total waste of money. don't buy from this seller .   disappointed back cover doesn't stay on can't put a case on it. fab phone! i bought the refurbished model of the note 4. it arrived quickly and worked well after charging the battery. (it was dead-flat at arrival, no issue.) i called tracfone, was assured that the unit was indeed able to be used on the tracfone byop (bring your own phone) plan. i ordered a sim card activation kit from tracfone (tf), which arrived quickly. i put it in, the screen said "unreadable." called tf, they sent me a replacement sim, same issue. i went on line to tf via a chat web site (on the tf web site), where the helpful lady ignored the unreadable statement; -she activated the phone, transfered my "buckets" of talk, sms and data, as well as my old phone number to the new note 4 in just a few minutes. all is well. it is actually better than "all is well," as when i power the phone on, it shows the red background screen and verizon on the opening splash screen .   (cool!) the note 4 is indeed on the verizon network, and it runs extremely nicely. i could not be happier! (my lg l41c showed tracfone at startup .  ) my wife just purchased a new apple iphone 6s plus on friday; -i still like the note 4 a lot better .   this phone has been refurbished and does not work correctly , stay away  .   this phone will be relevant for many years to come. even with the new phones, this phone will still outshine them. in terms of specs and battery life .   amazing phone .   the phone was in great shape and at a great price .   i had an original htc one and the camera was having problems. i used my available upgrade with my carrier to purchase the note 4 through amazon. it was a smooth and easy transaction. this was my first time buying a phone through amazon. worked out great. the phone itself is pretty cool. although, i thought i would use the stylus a lot more than i do. it's more like a novelty item/feature. however, i love the note itself. at first, i was concerned about the size of this thing. but, i've quickly adjusted to it. now, i find it hard to use smaller phones. battery, in general, usually lasts me most of the day. i mostly use it for web browsing, social media apps, photos and music .   fast shipping, product as advertised, replacement charger was cheap .   this was a great phone, and i got it cheaper than anywhere else on amazon. if you're phone shopping this phone is the complete package, but keep in mind it isn't small .   think i wrote the wrong item excellent job guys finally being a owner of a note 4 excellent condition still figuring how to do my alarm clock.  .   but finally being an owner of this good phone very clear video quality a must have. was packaged good nice phone works well minimal scratches always liked the note four would repeat purchase in the future .   it is working well as advertised .   i would suggest a phone from this company any day now. what a great phone .   i would ha e loved this phone if it didn't shut off all the time by itself. i have always had it in the case since the day i got it, and it just shuts off. couldn't send it back because it was the only phone i had due to my iphone being on the frits. really disappointed that i waisted ao much money on a phone that has many mess ups. this is an amazing phone i love it. i had to pay full price for an upgrade because i am grandfathered in on the verizon unlimited data plan and they wanted to make me sign a new contract for a new phone with would have gotten rid of my data and set me on a limited plan, and i told them i would rather pay full price for a new phone. so i did, and i am very happy with my new (to me) note 4 .   love it. unfortunately it had to be returned because the sm card was not clean and the service provider was unable to activate phone service. very disappointing, you would expect that these devices would be throughly checked out before selling to customers . so i am unable to rate .   i ordered a refurbished note 4 over a brand new note 5 because i wanted the memory slot and removable battery. samsung must not want my business anymore. the note 4 arrived in as-new condition. literally not a scratch for be found on it from or back. the phone activated with my carrier without any issues .   best smartphone that i ever had. even compared to the new note 5 this is the one to get. love the removable battery and also the removable sd card. the samsung phones take the best pictures by far. check out other peoples pictures and then look at the pictures of somebody that you know that has a samsung. they just do not compare .   outstanding deal and service. phone looked better than advertised. they said it was fairly new, but it looks like it was never used. the phone itself is really good too. love this note 4 .   i thought the larger size could be a problem but it's nice to have this size for business operations .   have had this bad boy for a while now, still people stare and say "wow, that's big!" i nod my head with a knowing smile and a flirting eyes i reply, "i know, thanks." i have fairly large hands, i've been lead to believe. my gloves are usually xl to xxl so when i got rid of my iphone a few years ago for the note 2 it was like i could finally have a similar experience with my phone as most, it fit my hand more comfortably. on the plus side the note 4 is everything its predecessors were and more (that doesn't always happen in tech). this iteration of the samsung phablet however is more powerful, more capable and more classier. (it's a shame how i put a case on mine, every time i take it off to wipe it i'm once again impressed by the design and feel of the phone. only a fool (or very careful person) would go caseless! i went from note 2 to this phone, instead of from note 3 so i don't know what changed from the third to the fourth. however from the second to the fourth, the change although not drastic was done with style was much welcomed. the phone is slimmer and has a more luxurious hand feel with it's metal bezel and leather backing, especially compared to plastic of note 2. whereas the second felt more rounder with its plastic shell, this phone feels more angular with precise edges and lower profile. 32 gb instead of 16gb. i've always relished the fact that i could add more storage for relatively cheap (especially coming from an iphone). i got a 64gb card for about $25 more, same time i bought this as i knew just how much storage i wanted, a lot! why not .   it's not necessary but if you get a phone with the capability (note 5 loses it) and the big bubba-lovin' screen, you gots to have some movies on there! android allows torrents and downloading from multiple places (be careful) unlike other companies that control their ecosystem. so i had about 20 torrents on my phone after a week .   i wish i would get stranded some where! (knocks on wood) i like the stylus, always been a fan of note's stylus though, nothing new here. some times i just dont feel like tippety tappin on a glass screen, so i hand write and either let the phone change it to text or leave it handwritten. asian languages are a go, obviously, it's made in asia. i use the finger print detector to open the phone, it's pretty accurate, sometimes too accurate. when my finger is wet or oily it just blinks a picture of a water droplet on the phone and says "foo', wipe yo' finga off!" or if my finger is at the wrong angle, denied! but you can set different angles and what not, eventually i'll get in, i used to get locked out and have to type in the backup password but now that i got the angles down, i'm money! i can't really say anything that bad or nagging about this phone. i guess a front facing loud speaker would be nice, but it is just a phone and that's asking too much. it would be nice if it came with headphones too but i know most people wind up losing or not using. honestly they would just become my workout headphones and be kaput in a few months. i usually sell my phone for the new iteration but after hearing the note 4 is the last one to have removeable storage i feel like i'm gonna try to hold on to it for a while, a long while .   what's not to like? it's fast, big, and does everything i need! i love being able to carry a second battery, if needed .   i love my new note 4 .   much cheaper than what i would have paid with sprint. i did not have any problems getting it activated at the sprint store and i love this phone .   great phone, still better than the note 5. i love it. i love this phone. it was a great deal .   i was looking for a newer phone to replace my lg spectrum 2 which i've had for about 3 years. i liked the replaceable battery, microsd card and wireless charging and wanted a phone that would have those features as well. after ruling out most new phones due to sealed batteries, no microsd and just too expensive, i bought a gently used recently and i wish i had bought it sooner! even being a year old, this phone does everything! the amoled screen is beautiful and large. games, netflix, amazon instant video and hbo now all look amazing on this screen. i've been getting ~4-4.5 hours screen on time before i need to recharge, way better than the 2-2.5 on my old lg. adaptive fast charging is also an awesome feature, full charge in about 60-70 minutes from single digits is pretty sweet! i could go on and on but most everything about this phone has been reviewed to death, suffice it to say that i will gladly use this phone for the next 2-3 years. hopefully samsung will bring back the user replaceable battery and microsd to the note line .   but i doubt it .   second time i purchased cellular devices from amazon.com for my specified carrier. i have no complaints and feel that i saved money over purchasing from my carrier. this phone will do what ever you need it to do, as much as you can expect from a phone. it's not a desktop pc, so don't expect it to be, but it is close. i will be sticking with note4 for a while and feel it is a long life device with samsung supporting needed security policy updates and operating system upgrades. if you have problems, do research before making statements of fallacy or uneducated reviews of any phone. i'm glad to have this device .   love it, but because i got the refurbished model it does lag a little but with the cleaner app it works much better .   was all it said it was. delivery was early .   beautiful phone, perfectly packed and shipped, was a gift to myself, still working my way through all the great features! thanks .   this phone was clearly the best phone of 2014-2015 and now it will be the note 5 for 2015-2016. i've only had it a day but i can say that i should have gotten this phone the day it came out! great size, picture, sound, speed and look! thank you samsung .   i love it. came in great shape. its like having my whole life in the palm of my hands .   phone is okay i guess. os seems choppy at times. even after all the updates .   great phone, great price .   so far this has been an excellent purchase my best of 2015 actually. this phone was defiantly worth the money and at the used price it was a steal. it's condition was nearly flawless rather than one minor screen scratch that wasn't even noticeable unless you looked at it very closely. the battery charges like normal so it was in very good quality. it lasts a day like normal charge. also when i purchased this used phone i was very weary of sneaky screen replacements because they are never as good as the original. the screen on my phone has not been replaced from a cracked original one and is a top 5 screen/display on the market as it should be as of this point in time fall 2015. the call reception and bars are excellent. connects to wifi quite strongly. 4g lte is great as well. the leather back adds a professional look. the screen is large but feels good in the hand and i can still text with one hand because i have larger hands. with the note 4 you can't go wrong as a power user this phone will be relevant for the next 3-4 years and people are constantly complimenting my phone. it is better than the note 5 imo due to the ir tv blaster, removable cover giving more case options, exchangeable batteries, mirco sd storage up to 128 gb, and this is more of a function over form phone if your split between the two. i will update this review in a month after use .   great unit, big clear screen, and long lasting battery .   so far this phone is great! i went from a motorola back to a samsung and i don't think i will ever use anything but samsung again .   this is an awesomeness sandwich with a side of bad assness .   just like new. better than expected and yes the phone is great, too. bought for my wife and happily enjoying upgrade from s4 .   i bought this for my husband and i'm so jealous because i want one too .   can't wait to purchase mine's .   really great phone. i have a note 2 so i really thought this was the best way to go. i didn't care for the home buttons it just felt odd and i don't like the new panel for the pen for it to work. the note 2 pen was easy just take out and use. but the screen is great and it's a fast working device. just not for me. i gave it to my grown son. he loves it .   very good phone. suits all of my needs. nice phone works great, however; i didnt know that by purchasing this phone that i would get caught up in a two year contract by the carrier. i have order a phone before and this never happen maybe it has something to do with the carrier .   s pen works accurately, battery last for well over 24 hours and that is with listening get to pandora and tunein radio for 10 hours. graphics are crisp and clear. camera works well. if i needed a phone, i would buy this again .   love the phone, the camera is the absolute best! but it's obvious something is wrong with it, and i'll have to return it. the phone has a glitch that makes it black out in the middle of what i'm doing. my emails don't download, facebook keeps stopping unexpectedly, and i have to constantly restart it. pretty annoying for an over $400 phone .   the issue i have is that the phone was not unlocked when i received it. after getting it unlocked, i find that whomever had this device previously, did not clear out their samsung account properly and now it's locked to their account "due to an abnormal factory reset." not a good way to start things off for your customers who spend so much money on a device that they can't even use. so now i've got to do all the dirty work and try to isolate the issue myself which is unacceptable. who had these devices previously? how can we get this resolved? can it be resolve and if not, then i will certainly be putting in a refund for this. very disappointing. nice phone. arrived quickly. best phone thus far. solid phone and does not seem to be buggy. screen is a perfect size. excellent features. i believe this is the last model you can add memory and swap out the battery. samsung has a winner here--too bad they are moving toward the apple model with the next series .   this phone is amazing. i have enjoyed it since the minute i opened the package. at first i was a little concerned because it said could not recognize sim card. but it quickly went away after i went to verizon to get my sim card switched .   the prepaid plan and the unlocked device is the way to go. awesome price for an amazing phone .   a lot of software bugs. awesome phone. its almost like a hand held computer. extremely practical and functionally superior .   great phone. plan on buying another one .   awesome. this phone has cheap unoriginal parts the "s pen is broken. the phone barely holds the pen in place and can not detect whether the pen is detached or not. the software is shoddy. it is very easy to tell it is not original having thoroughly used one of these devices before. i am very disappointed with this device and with the seller trying to ripoff an unknowing buyer. this seller is not trustworthy .   love my note 4. what can i say other than i love this phone. it is big, but that is what i wanted as i use it to stream movies from my comcast account. i like the size of the onscreen keyboard when texting or emailing as i don't mistype nearly as much as i did on my s3. the s pen works well if you are into that feature. the camera is really good and takes excellent pictures for a phone. i love that it has the expandable memory as i use it for videos and have a lot of pictures and don't want to take up all the space on my internal memory. this phone loads apps and internet pages fast. i did have an issue with it locking up initially, but did a net search and figured out it was due to the messenger notification feature on facebook. since i have turned that off i have not had any issues. i cannot blame that on the phone itself as it was found to be an issue with the android update that i am not sure has been fixed or not, but i don't need that feature so not an issue for me. great open box item from amazon warehouse deals .   i've owned the galaxy s2 and s3, but this is my first note.i simply love it - it's the new and improved version of my s3. i love the extra functions that come with the stylus. i thought the size would be a problem, but i actually like the bigger size; it's so much easier to use the camera and to read ebooks .   with the news that like the galaxy s6, the next note would lack a removable battery and expandable storage, i jumped at getting this. all in all i am very impressed and i use the stylus more than i expected. the only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that occasionally i find the response time when i touch an option to be slower than expected. don't get me wrong, it is still fast, but just not as blazing as i thought a new phone would be .   nice phone. read a lot about it before i purchased it. not disappointed at all .   i love my galaxy note 4! thanks amazon .   better than described. bought this under used/very good category and it's used/excellent. got here 12 hrs early and i have only had it for about 10 hrs but works great. buying a high priced used electronic can be scary but can not speak highly enough of this experience .   i am annoyed by the constant updates. so far i am satisfied by the battery life and fast charging .   love it .   love the white, the screen size is amazing. i don't find it difficult to use it as a phone being larger since it's so light .   looks brand new. no scrathes or anything. fast and takes awesome pictures .   excellent phone and battery life. have not charged the phone for 48 hours and still has 36% battery left .   not so great. got this phone about 2weeks ago and have had several issues pros: -big screen -camera takes great pictures -lighter than other phones the same size -great health features built in -widgets are neat -location based features are great cons -as soon as i put a few apps on the device it has slowed down considerably (everything i have read on this leads me to believe this is normal problem on android devices for some reason). most fixes to this require you to figure out which app is causing the issue then delete it. never had that issue on other phones. -for some reason with no apps running my phone is using a ton of ram (2.28gb out of 2.71gb, see pic) this also appears to be normal when i read about issues people are having with android. -if you like using samsung's s note its okay, (the stylus defaults cannot be changed to another note taking app). i use onenote and there is no option to set that as the default note taker, and there is no option to sign in to any locked notebooks on onenote. -most of my contacts didn't sync from outlook and itunes to google; also, what did transfer had a lot of duplicates show up, and about 3/4 of the contacts didn't transfer all information. none of my tasks or to do have transferred from outlook to google. -i've tried running several different apps to "speed up" the device (never needed to do this on any other phones). these don't have any lasting effect and i have to run them 10-12times a day. (make sure nothing is running in the back ground too) all in all it has been a very frustrating experience. good luck from samsung: in regard to the device using ram even when apps are not working, we would like to inform you that even apps are closed on the device it will be running in device background and it uses the memory to run on the device. ---so once i "close all apps", then go to the ram and close apps, then go in and force close apps individually, you are saying the apps are still running? after i just spent half an hour closing them all in a three step process? what .   we suggest you to force stop applications and check if the issue persists. from the home screen, tap on apps>> settings>> applications>> application manager>> swipe screen right or left to all tab>> open the apps from the list and tap on force stop. -------i do this constantly all day long then the apps keep showing up again about 5-10 minutes later. in regard to the email notification issue, please check if you are using same email account on three accounts, if you are using same account you will receive notifications from three apps as it will synced with the device. ---i get notifications from: --samsung email handler (don't want, but checks emails) --gmail email handler (don't like, doesn't get all emails, but ties some calendar functions together but not dependable) --and outlook which i installed (i use outlook and this was to only way to get my work emails, because nothing else would set it up, their app is not --good either as certain functionality is limited, no to do list or task manager updates etc.) ---why isn't there a normal email handler like on every other device i have had that can handle tasks, contacts, calendars, etc. the normal things that every other phone does that this phone needs three email accounts to accomplish? ---i've actually had to download a different (fourth) calendar to handle tying them all together and sunrise still can't pull it off. i've never had this be an issue on windows or iphone. in regard to the calendar/task issue, we would like to inform you that tasks will not sync which you receive from email account, however, if you have configured outlook account and if the events are saved in outlook only then it will be synced. -----see above. also, why is this so difficult? never had this problem on any other phone. only when i switched to samsung. in regard to dial and enter code to get an email, please check if you are using any third party app, as the default email app does not ask for any code to open the email. ----not third party it is what came on the phone. why cant i see voicemail from the "phone button". i shouldn't have to open a different app to check my voice mail. in regard to using the stylus with onenote app, we would like to inform you that the stylus should work with the app, however, please check the compatible with the app developer. ----the stylus will work with the app. what i said was the default can't be changed for the stylus. for example: i don't use snote. i use onenote. when pulling the stylus out of the phone there is an option to have a note pop up. i want onenote to pop up but the default options are snote or off. i bought this phone to enhance my use of onenote. now this lack of features disables me. i would not have bought this phone had i known i could not change that feature. in a time where every default can be changed to suit your needs this phone is extremely limited in regard to the battery draining, device freezing, app shutting down and notification issue, please access the link below to follow the steps to troubleshoot the issue. -----why should i have to do this? why should i have to do any of this? i just want a phone that works, the way i want it to and won't catch on fire in my pocket, freeze up whenever i want to use a map or open two apps, run out of battery as soon as i take it off the charger. i fixed the battery issue sort of. i bought the extra battery that samsung provides. great now i have to carry extra batteries because the battery will die if i decide to use any apps?

no other manufacturer has told me to remove problem apps like outlook, waze, or facebook? these are not strange apps that i don't want on my phone. this is 2015 and the norm is apps on your phone. 3. out of memory: device that is out of memory can cause delays and keep applications from opening. ----no i bought extra memory 4. memory card issues: old memory cards may cause issues with stored applications. ------it is brand new, ordered from samsung, on samsung's website 5. factory data reset: resolve device issues with a factory data reset. -----on the phone i just bought? again why? no other manufacturer has asked me to do that. why sell a phone that doesn't work and has to be reset? waiting to hear back again .   i am actually really impressed with this device. i was worried hearing the reviews about it working horribly with the lollypop update, but i have had it over a month and have had no problems besides one. my only problem is the amount of bloatware. the processes that run in the background are annoying like ant radio. i am a heavy user, i use it not only as a phone, but i also use it to write and draw on a regular basis. the battery holds up really well and is great for using it all day and not worrying about accidentally forgetting my charger at home when i go to work. (my previous phone would be dead before i even got out of work without even touching it). phone is in good condition .   great phone .   wanted it. waited for my contract to run out, and saved 100 bucks by getting it on amazon. love this phone .   it's ok a little bored with it now. good. the phone was in great condition as used .  it works well but the touch screen sometimes doesnt work. but i think i got a good deal .   have enjoyed my note 4 just like i did my galaxy s3! i may not use as many features as some but i have enjoyed all those i do use. watching movies, taking picures, notes, calendar, many apps .  it's my baby! i was curious if the battery life was much better than on my galaxy s3, which many complained about. i normally always kept my s3 charging and a couple times when i had to go most of the day without it on the charger .  it was not good. i have to say that the battery life on the note 4 is soooooooooo much better .   great product, great price. product didn't work correctly had to send in for repair. would not get 4g network. it's big and it's the best phone i have ever had i'm a big guy so the size fits me great if you have smaller hands it can be a little hard but that's not me so no knock there. phone was in good condition, exactly as advertised, and works perfectly. i purchased this phone used and brought it to tracfone's byop wireless service. it fits in my budget and is an excellent phone. the camera is awesome and the large screen makes using apps and web browsing easy. the display is wonderful .   i like what this phone can do, and the many different options there are to customize it, the camera is amazing .   great phone best price. so far i'm loving the phone. so many features, i'm still discovering all the nuances. wonderful, big hd display, terrific speaker sound, and lots of memory for files and tunes .   awesome phone! in perfect condition & no problem with activation at verizon .   does what i want it to. primarily interested in email and facebook. plus some search capabilities .   love the phone. got this over my previous samsung galaxy s3 which had become terribly slow over the years. phone is big for one handed use but you get used to it. my hands and fingers are quite big, so typing is easier. there is also a one handed use mode which is nice - surprisingly i thought i would never use it but i end up using it a lot - kudos samsung! amazon display, fast processor for an android, excellent battery life - even with bluetooth and location on, easily lasts 1.5 days. camera is also superb - one of the best cell phone cameras i have seen the stylus is quite handy for taking notes, overall a 5 for me this one .   great phone and great seller .   - all around slow to complete tasks - overall bad mobile signal strength even when my other old evo 4g lte phone has good signal and i work in several large cities. - not able to use hotspot unless very strong lte signal even when my old evo 4g lte phone hotspot works. - keyboard doesn't always come up when taping (selecting) on screen. - random different apps appear on screen when turning on - can't use internet when on calls. - no slider zoom on cam, pinch zoom is choppy. - canâ€™t easily turn flash on/off, this is an often used function which should be on main screen. - unable to capture stills from video. - unable to save emails as calendar tasks to come back to from the calendar. personal aggravations: - no arrows on keyboard. - power cord on bottom (bad in cup holder) - pwr & vol buttons opposite each other so they both often get pressed at same time. - unable to see soft keys when screen is lit. - physical home button in the way and hard to push (everything is a soft tap but the home button) .   overall a great phone. this phone has all the options and features i wish i had on this laptop. good size, pen feature, compatible with all my other devices and is tough. i bought it for a second time after swimming with my first one .   no it doesn't float .   my rating describes the product and the buying experience. i have no complaints with the note 4. it takes great pictures, has a large but not too large form factor, has great functionality with the stylus abilities, has excellent color in the screen, sufficient storage, fast changes between apps as well as the ability to open multiple apps - like if you want to listen to youtube while looking at the internet. so far, i'd rate the phone and return experience a 5. i've had a bad experience with the seller estock - they show a clear pattern of poor quality control with their products though their delivery was one day from order to mailbox. i had a great experience with amazon prime where i've been able to return all defective phones with no hassle for a full refund. i bought four samsung galaxy note 4's that were refurbished starting about a month ago. the first which i am using right now has been perfect for about a month. the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th which i purchased for my wife weren't. the 2nd phone had a red smudge about the size of a dog tick under the glass. the 3rd had a problem with screen rotation and the stylus. the screen did not auto rotate and the stylus had a tip that fell out inside the phone silo. the 4th phone had a problem with freezing, a loose home key, a stylus that had a tip that fell out, and it didn't operate at all with the stylus. estock did promptly ship replacement styli and the one that finally stayed intact was a black one. the phone is white. the 5th phone will not be purchased through estock. i'd rate the buying experience a -1 out of a scale of 1 - 5 .   very clumsy cover with plastic all over. s pen is a complete joke. it is a hit and miss when it works. camera quality is a bit better than iphone3. low light camera is at the worst quality. i have 7 different phones at home since i am a developer and i do not like this device over what it actually do. some improvement has been made on quality compared to note3 but it's very little. their finger print scanner is a hit and miss. i recommend either sony or lg over this one .   good  .  thank you. easy process to buy. it seems to be a great phone so far. have not found anything that i don't like with it .   good phone. the phone itself is pretty awesome, but the battery may need to be replace from my experience from using samsung. the battery can become defective for no apparent reason and usually a new battery swap is the answer. of course i meant to say after a year or so .   then you need to get a replacement .   replacing galaxy s4. very pleased with the upgrade .   phone is in great condition, super fast and reliable. i would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new phone .   awesome phone .  definitely exceeded my expectations .   love it. phone had a scratch on screen other than that all is good. i like using my phones without any cases, the chamfered edges on the note 4 are just to fragile. hopefully with the note 5, samsung address this issue .   great phone love the pen for quick memos longer battery life sometimes lags but not nearly as often as my s3 or s4 did the verizon bloat ware doesn't help so i don't fully blame samsung on that, excellent screen size and performs all other daily necessary functions for the person on the go, cheaper than buying at the verizon store as well .   absolutely wonderful phone. very responsive, had the note 2 before and it is a great improvement .   excellent case! all of buttons line up along with the mic and speaker holes. also fits very well .   well, it was great until at&t forced the infamous lollipop 5.0.1 operating system "upgrade" and messed up a bunch of stuff .   this is the best phone i have ever owned. the s-pen is what caught my eye. i wish i can add more to this review, but there is so much i like about this phone that i can't fit it all here! great job samsung, i'll be keeping this note 4 until my contract renews .   my wife loves everything about this phone, great battery, awesome screen, exceptional utilities. she really loves the calendar and camera .   the spen doesn't work. i bought this phone for the spen. i am very upset. also, the "free car charger" is a 25 cent charger port from a gas station .   great phone. i planned to get the galaxy 6 as soon as it was available. i was so excited until .   samsung made the dumbest design decision - no removable battery and no ability to add a sd card. if i wanted a phone with less options than the galaxy 3-4-5 - i could have bought an iphone! so, after much research i ordered the note 4 and it is the best phone i have ever owned. i bought 3 spare batteries and a 128gb card and i am ready for anything because this phone can handle it. important: i have not allowed my note 4 to update to lollipop 5.0 it came with android 4.4.4 and it runs beautifully. there are so many complaints about lollipop. i'm not sure if it's an issue with samsung or verizon, but until i see that the bugs are worked out i'll keep 4.4 - it's fast, the battery lasts a long time and i want to keep it that way .   i have been using the note-4 for 6 months now. while the phone is amazing. this review is based on the problem that i am facing with its reception. since i have this phone, i have multiple times complained to att and their answers somehow never resolved my issue. i get very poor signal or sometime no signal which resulting into not reachable or going calls directly into voicemail. the people who calls and talk with me complains about voice is bad or not clear, breaks etc. i changed my sim card through att assuming it might be the bad sim causing this issue. now i am tired of everything. not sure if this is a device problem. the phone itself is bad? since i purchased it through amazon, att would not help me. amazon please tell me what to do .   awesome phone! but the boot loader is locked f*$# you att and verison .   phone is worthless now after waiting 6 months for a root and not im out over 400$ because its decreesed in value and i want to sell this piece of s@#$. great phone for a normal user, but if you like tech and want to root your phoen for the most out of your money get a nexus or anything els .   great deal, love everything about the phone and was in very good state. this is the best phone i have ever owned and i've had a lot of phones! i bought this phone to replace a note 2. what a difference between the two phones. the camera is wonderful - pictures are sharp and clear. they are actually better than my very expensive camera. the sound is crystal clear; the note was a bit garbled and they seem to have corrected this problem. the only issue i have with the phone is samsung still insists on putting the speaker on the back, which really doesn't make sense. with a phone this big, i usually make calls using the speaker which means i have to turn the phone over for good volume. a problem if you are chatting face to face. the same issue if you are watching tv on the phone. it has to be upright, rather than on a table, to hear the sound clearly. all in all, i do love this phone and would recommend to anyone .   just as described .   very user friendly and i love the multiple window visuals .   very happy with this phone. i am loving it .   excellent phone. great phone. easily the most powerful smartphone i have ever used. i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of digital anything. it has a wonderful, spectacular camera with innovative shooting modes, such as panoramic selfie. the video quality is unrivaled. the multi-window capabilities are endless and the processor handles it all with ease. i got mine refurbished and after a month or so of use, i still love this phone more than any other tech i have owned. it is wonderful, if you are a techie. i would be disinclined to recommend this phone if you want something suuuuper simple. the s-pen functionality has significantly improved and the s-pen tip choice is a stellar addition, making your pen feel most comfortable and pen-like for yourself. the fingerprint scanner works flawlessly about 95% of the time. if your fingers are wet, make sure you set an easy backup password. i have mine on kit kat currently and there haven't been any flaws in the software. it is a little heavy on the bloatware etc, but the phone is fantastic .   love my phone. it was really good. perfect replacement for my note3. love it. great item, great price .   great phone. very nice phone and as item description. best phone i've ever had. great phone. google expert reviews to get the restâ€¦. you're welcome .   excellent.  .   exactly as described. not a nick or scratch, may as well have been sent from the manufacturer. it was and is perfect .   i love my phone, i am very satisfied with purchase .   can't say enough about this phone, love it .   i use this phone more as a tablet. outstanding! can't go wrong if you need bigger screen and ridiculous resolution. highly recommended .   best phone i ever had. love it, love it, love it. debated for quite awhile on what to get, but then my old phone broke and my hand was forced. my decision came down to either the nexus 6 or the note 4. what sold me on the note was the expandable memory and replaceable battery. some things i wanted to know and now do: -touchwiz is fairly seamless with android at this point, or at least it feels that way. i don't realize i'm using touchwiz, nor does it bog down the os. -at this point in my use, i don't really use the s-pen. i can foresee it's use in the future, as i intend to use my phone for taking notes in school (with a bluetooth keyboard), so making screen captures or writing on pictures of notes with the s-pen might be handy. -the performance is as snappy as anything i've ever used. once you tune the phone the way you'd like (i disabled a bunch of apps i'll never use, hopefully to preserve ram; i also turned animations off to preserve battery life), it's fantastic. -plenty of customization potential. i hope to be using this for a long, long, time .   loved my note 2 and love note 4 even better. faster .   more memory! :-). i upgraded this from a samsung note 2. lots of features, good camera , s pen, great screen , powerful processor. front camera doesn't work. great, worked as expected. excellent phone. this is my first samsung phone, but based on my usage with this phone and my experience with the s6, it will definitely not be my last .   absolutely love it .   everyone kept telling me not to get it because it was too big! (i have amall hands) but i can handle it just fine .  i use both hands to txt, but then i did with my other phone also (galaxy s2l). what can i say? i had the i, then the 2, and now the 4. love/loved each and every one. did i say how much i love my phone? :) just one problem. it looks like my sims card is bad. the rep at the sprint store i went to did not have another one to switch mine with mine. she took it out and put it back in and said if i had any more problems with it to call sprint and they will replace it. it worked a while but just today the message came on again saying my card could not be located. i will call sprint today for a new one. still, i love my note 4 .   i have had this phone for about a week now and it is amazing. the only problem i have with it is sometimes if you have someone on speaker phone they cannot hear you. i dont know if this is due to the noise cancellation on the phone or maybe just the nature of this device .   powerful phone. just a little big .   beast of a phone .   i went from s3 to this and it's like night and day. i can't say enough about the clarity and the feel. very small bezel, light but sturdy feel and the display knocks s3 out of there. extremely pleased with purchasing it through at&t. set up 1 year payment plan. had issue with porting my number but they fixed that within 1/2 of my call. haven't used the s pen yet but have played with it. btw - must take out the battery to insert the sim card. took me a bit to figure that out .   great phone. fast processor and good battery life. large but once you go large you'll not want to go back. good camera and display .   another shot out of the park by samsung! been a note convert since the 2. can't beat the function, screen, stylus, etc. as long as samsung keeps the note line alive i'll keep buying! great job .   years ahead of apple is terms of features, performance, and customization. having also owned the note 2, the iphone 6 plus is basically that same phone (from 2012) but without the stylus or excellent multitasking modes, or widgets, or replacable bateries, or .   insert one of a thousand other things google will tell you here .   honestly, i love this phone. i love the new features added as well as the mapping of the keys 8 like the better camera and the addition of the slow motion feature. that being said, they took off one of my favorite features to be able to take pics realtime with different lenses like the oil pastel or cartoon and moved themost into the picture editing. when you do that, they don't come out as good. also, the battery life is quite bad. most of the time just listening to music and using fb requires a charge before the end of my work day. and there aren't any good alternative extended batteries .   i love my new phone and the price i paid for it .   exactly as advertised, great product, good condition .   i have to say i'm very satisfied with this phone .  it was not what i originally expected, but it was a very nice surprise .   i like the galaxy note 4 a lot. however, the phone as purchased does not include a sim card. after it arrived, i asked sprint to send me a sim card twice, and the phone recognizes neither one of them. the phone is functional, but annoyingly limited because of its dependence on the sim card. not sure what my next steps are, but am frustrated with this gap in the product given the expense of the purchase .   great phone. love this phone. fast delivery. love my new phone .   great buy. i love this phone .   i bought this to replace a galaxy note 2. it is slightly larger and has more features. the large screen is useful for texting and viewing .   very good phone close to the s6. love my new phone. text messages were disappearing on 2 of the devices i purchased from amazon ,due to an "att" issue .   love my note 4, i was deciding between the note 4 and s6, and decided to go with the note 4, completely happy with the mult-functional uses. great price and more efficient then the s6. its powerful phone with removable battery, add storage and stylus pen .   i have dropped this phone several times, and nothing has happened to it. best part is the stylus. you can jot down or drawn anything .   awesome phone.  .   very confused on all the features and how to use them since i was strictly an iphone user .   best smartphone ever, and size is perfect .   just as described, thanks .   far and above the best mobile phone i've ever had. beautiful screen, smooth and powerful processor, spectacular camera, multi-tasking tools and the s-pen. this phone has it all. it's bells and whistles have bells and whistles .   best phone have ever owned .   this phone freezes every other time i attempt to use the camera, send a picture message, or attach a file. the bad part about it is that it started freezing on day 31. multiple applications visibly slow the processor. the note 2 was much better .   exallant. great battery, quick charging, the features are great, have had no issues with this at all. love it, this is my 4th galaxy product starting with the s3, best so far. not much it can't do aside from be my girlfriend .   great phone .   samsung has made an amazing phone. again. i had a note 2 before this and the difference between the 2 is jaw dropping. selfies are a must with this phone and the rear camera can easily compete with any dslr in the market. i was split between s6 (latest phone, amazing camera features) and nexus 6 (stunningly big screen); then i chose note 4 and voila, it gave me satisfaction of both these phones in one. battery life is simply amazing. screen is super amoled good .   upgraded from an iphone 4s, still grandfathered in for verizon's unlimited data so had to buy outright. this was an easy choice for me since i love drawing and watching movies and shows as the note 4 dwarfs the iphone 4 period let alone the screen .   didnt like it. aside from some glitches with the wifi at work (no problems elsewhere), this is a great phone .   first one i got had a problem with the microphone. my replacement is flawless. ill be happy with this phone for a nice long time. my phone is great no scratches or dents and works like brand new .   very happy customer. will not turn on after one month of use. are you serious .   love this phone. it's exactly what i wanted -- a combination phone and tablet. that keeps me from needing to carry around two different devices .   love my new note. the camera is incredible .   i love my note 4! battery life is super! i can't think of any negatives .   love it. wonderful phone! i bought this about two months ago to upgrade from my samsung s3. i wanted a little bigger screen and the note 4 has a great display. overall speed is great. calling and e-mail are are easy and work fine. the wifi connect speeds with an ac router are much greater than my old phone. will regularly connect at 500 to 800mbs on 5ghz band and does much better at at the ends of my home far from the router. so online downloads will be limited by your cable company speeds, not this phone! pen and screen notepad functions work well and handy for quick notes or sketching out a little layout drawing etc. battery life is very good and will charge from 15% to 100% in less than 60 minutes in fast charge mode. camera is great, much better than s3. battery is still removable and access to sd card is not difficult. the phone is big so this takes a little getting use to but it will still fit in your pocket with a rubber slip on case. verizon recently provided update to android lollipop 5.01 which makes the phone even better! costs about $100 more than the s5 but worth every penny to me. i have had none of the problems that some of the 1 or 2 star reviewers post here. in fact i have had no problems with this phone at all .   by far, this is the best phone .   ever. just updated it and love it. put a 64gb card and it works great. love the onboard stylus and the fact if you leave it behind, the phone alerts you before you get too far away. i have shown this phone and some of its abilities to others and before i know it they too have this phone. i know of at least 5 people who have this phone now since i have sold it to them. ironically with the larger screen and the case i have for it .   i have yet to drop it. it fits so perfectly in my hand that when i hold my old samsung galaxy s3 it seems so small. this is also the fastest charging phone with the provided fast adaptive charging plug. i have a business and this phone is a great tool .   wonderful phone. bought it for my husband and he loves it. what is not to love .   a brick would be better than the droid bionic he was using .   love the phone. only problems i had with it is that the battery was no good and it didn't come with a charger. i had to buy a charger straight up and then a battery right after. the phone itself was in great condition and works like a dream compared to the old droid bionic i was using .   cool. this will be my first android phone. thankfully i have an android tablet that allowed me to learn the os. the phone is pretty amazing and i liked that i can add my own storage. i am currently using a samsung 64 gb micro sd card and it is great. the camera on this phone is amazing, it allows me to take pictures from a distance and still show up very clear. the phone is rather large but i like the full display. i would recommend this phone to anyone .   this is a great phone! the speed of the processor is amazing. i have used iphones and they do not even come close to this device. android's os paired with this device has made my life so much easier. the large screen size is great for my over 50 eyes! do not get an iphone, get a samsung note 4 .   nice phone. phenominal phone. i transitioned from an iphone 4s, and never looked back. its fast and fluid when browsing, and the screen quality is beyond belief for hd videos .   excellent. this phone is awesome and i got it at a great price. the shipping was super fast and my phone was easy to activate as soon as i received it. thank you for offering the latest phones at the best prices .   best phone for a professional! email, social media, the works. i had the 2, 3, and just upgraded to this 4. i pass them down to my daughter who is in sales each time i upgrade and she loves the note as well! the camera is much better on this one and that was a needed improvement .   i have to say that this is the best cell phone that i have ever had you don't need your computer no more you are walking around with your computer in your hand and if i had to write all the things you can do with this phone i would need a few pages i am learning something new everyday, yes it a little big but just wait till you see the screen you will love this phone .   i see her using it all the time and it looks like it must be awesome .   great phone. couldn't be happier. upgraded from note 2 and this one is far more superior in every way from build quality to performance and screen resolution .   it's great. love it glad i purchased it .   this phone is fantastic .   good price at that time. delivered as promised .   you are better off buying a factory unlocked as opposed to a verizon unlocked phone. this phone can not be used completely for tmobile. many features don't work e.g. the number key does not work when you are prompted to enter a numeric option key after it is connected. also the hot spot option does not work, the phone number can not be recognized. if you are only using for verizon, it is ok but don't expect to use it 100% with other carriers .   the best phone i have owned. love the stylus functions. easily replaces a tablet for almost everything. i like the bigger size, it still fits in my pants pocket. amazon has the best pricing on phones out there .   love the phone. i had the note 2 previously and loved it. note 4 has even more features. it feels slimmer than the 2 and fits better in my hand. i can't live without the stylus that comes,with a note. save money and buy from amazon instead of verizon .   i purchased this samsung note 4 in february 2015 and now the on-board mic does not work. people on the other end cannot hear me and i cannot use voice search or voice commands. my bluetooth headset works fine. i reached out to samsung and was told i need to contact amazon for replacement. since my order is more than 30 days old, i cannot contact for replacement. has anyone else had this issue and do you have any advice on how to get a replacement? thanks .   best phone ever. the best phone i have so far. i love it. if not having a changeable battery and micro sd card port in your phone is a deal-breaker, this is the phone for you! i have been a samsung cellphone customer for about eleven years and have owned the galaxy s2 and s4 and love samsung's quality. i was planning to upgrade to the s6, but samsung made a sea change in their design philosophy and jettisoned these two features that set it apart from apple and which i cannot live without. even consumer reports rates the much older s5 above the s6 for these issues and the note 4 has the fast battery charging feature that consumer reports loves, but is not found in the s5. upgrading from the s4, i am extremely happy with the larger li-ion 3,220 mah capacity battery, better speaker, and fantastic screen/screen size in addition to the other features that come with a new phone: faster processor, better camera, etc. i have found that a fully charged battery lasts more than a day. additionally, i am impressed with the fast battery charging feature, pen, and other note features. my only gripe is with the maximum capacity of the micro sd card port: the phone only supports up to a 64gb card -- no better than my two-year-old s4! overall, i am very pleased and have no regrets about not buying a galaxy s6 and only hope that samsung sees the error of it's ways regarding changeable batteries and micro sd card ports in time for my next phone! accessories i recommend for this phone (and own):â chapter xvi the book premium leather case;verus thor heavy drop protection case;samsung galaxy note 4 protective cover/case;multifunctional outdoor sports climbing wasit bag for the samsung galaxy note 4; and theâ joto samsung galaxy note 4 tempered glass screen protector .   the s-pen is probably the number one feature of this phone, and works beautifully. the display is simply amazing, and pictures taken with this phone are crystal clear. on the downside the inability to use google voice commands globally for the phone is a major downside, as the samsung voice commands are less intuitive and the voice it responds back with is super robotic. i have never personally liked the touchwiz user interface, however when paired with the s-pen it does bring out the good of the touchwiz interface. i upgraded from the galaxy s4 with cyanogenmod. i love cyanogenmod, however i will not be installing it on this phone because you lose most, if not all of the built in functionality of the s-pen, which was one of the features that sold me on this phone; and i must say it has proven quite wonderful .   great phone .   these are great phones, nice step up from the s3 and nothing apple produces can compete. thought it might be too big but it's just about right .   the galaxy note 4 is nice i like it .   has some minor issues from time to time but overall a fantastic phone .   this replaced my note 2. beautiful display. apps load quickly .   i don't think i can tell you anything you won't easily find out from 1000 online reviews. this thing is huge and fast, takes great pictures and has a great battery. i compared it to the note edge in the store and liked this better, since it was easier to hold .   best phone on the market. i've had it for a month and i'm still learning new things .   i love my note4 except the fact that i cant be on the phone and internet at the same time. love the phone. so many features .   great phone. best phone ever! just waiting for the update from samsung. love it .   1/2 the price of upgrading through verizon.com or instore .   great speed with the shipping and i love this device. i love this phone a lot of storage on the phone and with the 128gb memory card i never run out of storage space. i do need to restart the phone about once a week or it starts acting up by not connecting to my bluetooth or something but it is by far the best phone i have had .   i got the phone this is my second note 4 and currently having issues this one atleast once a day it will randomly shut down i've tried factory reset and other help articles i've found but it still locks up and won't work until removing battery to restart. if any help on this would be awesome i don't really wanna be without a phone to return this .   my battery lasts longer and the performance is great. i would recommend this to anyone who would like to try this smartphone .   noice .   okay .   love it  .   awesome phone .   love the white color, love its functionality and the awesome rapid charger! love my new phone and amazon had the best price! no one could beat it or my new phone .   surpasses my samsung s4. note 4 is perfect size. samsung note edge was too funky to see using curved right side glass. i tried edge for 2 weeks .   i'm a retired middle aged guy loving the upgrade from samsung s4 to samsung note 4. i use gmail, skype video my kids and friends. love google apps on samsung note 4. i got $100 cheaper on amazon from amazon-verizon fulfillment than from verizon direct. life is good .   love it. great overall phone. love love love this phone it is everything i was looking for. the camera is practically in hd. if i was given the option to purchase again i will. great phone. i love it. great pictures and easy to use. light and nice looking. battery is great .   great phone. my only wish is that i didn't get with at&t. service is okay, but this device has been update ready for months and at&t still won't release the update .   after the purchase, i find that verizon will not upgrade an existing prepay account until the prepay phone has been in use at least 6 months. real bummer! otherwise, i have not used the phone enough to otherwise comment .   so love this phone .   just what i expected. though i thought the camera would be a little better though. feels better to hold then the note 2 and has many features i havent gotten to yet. also the battery is perf. at first it died a little too sucky but it got so much better after about a week or two .   super quick and super fast response. none of the accessories or batteries from my old note 3 fit .   love it .   love my new phone .   amazing freaking phone. i love it .   great phone, i live it. love it .   excellent! i love it. great price! i have a note 8 as well. i love the note line .   the camera is perfect .   plus: 1. build quality from samsung is improving a lot these days. note 4 has much better build quality than s5 and it feels much better to hold this even than iphone 6plus. 2. beautiful display with 2k resolution. 3. the battery life is also good, comes easily for a day with normal usage. i had the iphone 6plus also for few days and note 4 has better battery life than 6 plus. 4. expandable memory and replaceable battery. minus: 1. lot of crapware from samsung and att. 2. slow updates. 3. touchwiz can be annoying at times .   my only complain is there's no 32g and no earplug. i love this phone no complaints. screen is amazing .   love it better than the note 2. my note 2 needed to be replaced and this note 4 is awesome .   it doesn't really seem that much bigger than the note 2 to me, although it was difficult for me to find a wallet case .   awesome phone s. samsung overall has a great phone but they need to really get tech with upgrades. i love my galaxy note 4. i came from a lg g3 and it is by far the better phone. the battery life is really good for as large of a screen as it has and even when i use my mobile hotspot function it doesn't drain as rapidly as other phone had in the past .   more scratches on the screen than i thought but works good so far. takes awesome crystal clear selfies, regular pics are just as crystal clear. has the same 16mp as the samsung galaxy s5 but i find the note 4 pics are a lot clearer and better than the s5. selfies are certainly far better than those taken with the samsung galaxy s5. i love this phone - but because i love galaxies. i almost never use the stylus. the cut and paste option is fun - but not really useful. everything else about the pen is - superfluous. the camera is very nice. i prefer the options on the s3, but the photo quality of the note4. this phone as all, is totally overpriced, so make sure you get a deal. it's a phone. that said, there are some nice features like the way you go back to open pages. love that. and swiping away things you don't want - cathartic! and for those of us over 40 - we can see it .   it's not bulky at all. it's just tall. i like that. and when you talk it's long enough to feel like a phone. it's a great smartphone. glad i bought it. highly recommend .   best phone out. luv my new phone. best .   no, the reception with this phone is terrible. love it .   the phone and the flip cover works great and i'm pleased. however the headphone that was supposed to come with the unit was missing. please advise. thanks. phone works very well and samsung note 4 is the best! very happy with the purchase. :-). i like it. better than my note 2. awesome phone .   easy to activate and fast shipping. will purchase all my phones from amazon for now on .   great phone - expensive so it is definitely a treat! bought mine for my birthday :). great phone, does way more than i'll ever be able to learn to do with it .   awesome phone! i love every ascept of this phone .   awesome phone. beautiful screen can be used in direct sunlight. phone lasts around 4 to 5 hours of on screen time consistently. only game i play is minecraft which runs without any problem. external speaker volume is adequate. the removable battery and microusb card slot are definitely useful. build quality is really nice. android is very stable and has so much flexibility. sprint service cannot provide simultaneous voice and data (except when you have wifi) which can be a major negative for some people .   i purchased the samsung galaxy note 4 for my husband. he reads a lot and it made no since to carry around an e reader. the slightly larger size is a nice compromise. he now uses only the galaxy note 4 for all of his reading. he has no complaints .   best phone/tablet ever. still learning the features, just got it about a month. but a must have .   i'm giving 3 stars because it was a month long process. i kept getting a damaged phone. very frustrating. love my phone and finally it works. i could not love this phone more! i had the note 2 (which i sold to gazelle upon receipt of this). the new functions on this phone are amazing. also, the fact that you can purchase it substantially less than at a verizon retailer is even better :) no when i want to purchase something, i first look on amazon because you can almost guarantee they will beat any price .   loving it. best phone ever. just a lot of phone in a great package. it helped a former i-fone fan to switch (not me) .   great phone .   best one i have ever owned. this does everything i want plus stuff i'm still figuring out. i bought this phone from here for 100 less than the retail store and i couldn't be happier .   works well for me. the display is awesome in all lighting conditions. because of the size and speed i find myself not using my tablet as often especially for quick tasks. even though the speaker is on the back i have not yet had a problem with hearing anything, but i also don't expect stereo like audio. i am happy with this purchase .   best note ever .   best ever .   i'm happy with my purchase so far. :). my previous phone was the samsung galaxy s3. the larger galaxy note 4 design feels different in hand as it is both thinner and larger. however, it only took a few days for it to feel natural while holding and talking on the phone. i normally keep my phone in a case and slip it in my back pocket. since the note 4 is taller than most phone, carrying in the back pocket when mounted in a phone case may take some getting used to. this led me to look for a thinner case than i originally purchased. i was delighted to learn that samsung made a case for the note 4. the samsung galaxy note 4 case, protective cover both protects and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone. add a tempered glass screen protector and you're done. as for the note 4 itself .  flawless. if you are an android user, done allow the larger size to be the deal breaker. cannot say the same for amazon wharehouse deals as they mixed up my initial order and sent me a lg3. someone out there got a sweet note 4 on that deal .   arrived on time and son loves this phone. great cell. finding new things everyday. upsm is a life saver .   it arrived today as it daid it would now chargering and learning how to work it. samsung is doing better as time goes on .  but needs a lot of improvement in their glitchy and sluggish operating system .   nice phone came in as advertised and has worked well .   i really love it. the battery is phenomenal, lasting for a very long time as compared to other smartphones i owned previously. and i live in an area where the cell signal is very weak, which means that the phone uses more battery power to sync up with the cell tower. the fast charger is also wonderful. i can now charge the phone within less than half hour, while i prepare for work in the morning. so no need to keep it plugged in all night. the stylus is very nifty, and i now use it to jot down thoughts on the go, including stuff that i need to pick up at the store (no more yellow stickies, or having to launch an app and typing with the on-screen keyboard). i just whip out the stylus, click on memo and i am writing! specially nifty in meetings and note-taking can have several pages. but the beauty is to import it as an electronic note afterwards. if you are on the fence on this, leap now. the note 4 is really worth it .   just everything is so wonderful .   i love this smartphone except 1 thing. the note 4 running 4.4.4 kitkat is periodically locking up or shuts off completely and requires me to remove the battery and power on again or plugin external power and power on again .   there's a million reviews of this phone out there, so nothing i put here will matter. it's exactly what i expected it to be .   size and functions meet my needs and exceed my expectations. easy learning curve. photos are incredible .   meh .   great phone. best phone i have ever owned (seriously) and i have had just about everything (except the iphone) very bright screen and battery life is best i have ever had with a smart phone. love it .   i have one and i gave this one to my wife and she loves it .   love this phone .   the size is great and i love the stylus that came with it .   excellent upgrade from a nexus 4. i actually prefer the samsung ui and apps to the stock android experience now, and i'm very impressed by features like the high resolution display and the s pen and all its related apps. i was concerned about the phone size being too large, but that turned out to be a non-issue. the phone fits naturally into my front pocket as i prefer, and i don't notice any awkwardness issues due to dimensions or weight when using it .   awesome. good price,thanks. i upgraded from a note 2. very happy with this upgrade .   love the big screen and the camera takes great pics. love my note 4. works perfectly and very fast. screen is bright and clear. s-pen is very useful .   i've had this phone for two months now. the battery life is as expected, last about a day, which is standard for most smart phones. the phone isn't perfect but it is fast and the screen is crystal clear. i've had to purchase an extended battery but the original will certainly last all day on pretty heavy use. certainly do wish there weren't so many pre-installed apps on it but most carries do this.i'm very happy with this phone but it's not without it's faults, very so rarely the phone will freeze and re-start. this has happened twice since i've owned it. this might be a deal breaker for some, but i'm not a phone snob. the hassle of sending it back under factory warranty is not worth my time as this too is pretty common with all smart phones i've used, yes, even iphones. overall, great phone .   great phone with long battery life, stunning display, and amazing camera. this phone is very fast and looks amazing. the s pen allows for unique features could be better if the speaker was not on the back but if you use head phones for media you dont notice it .   for the most part, i love it! the screen is gigantic and bright, i have unparalleled control with the s-pen, and the processor is crazy fast. no more game lag, i get great service, and it's an aesthetically gorgeous phone (the metal sides really make it feel premium despite my concerns about the 'leather' back which is nice as well). i only have a few complaints, and i would say none of them area major. the battery life is not as long as i expected. it still beats the hell out of my old htc onex, and i'm not worried about dragging around a backup charger anymore, i just thought it would withstand some minimal use plus game play without my charge dropping tens of percentages within the hour. if i keep the screen dim most of the time the battery lasts eons longer, and power saving and ultra power saving mode conserve energy really well. on the flip side of the coin, i can talk on the phone for ages and the battery lasts, and when i do need to charge it, the adaptive fast charger does it in about an hour. the only downsides for the size of the phone is that it doesn't fit in my pockets (girl pants are the worst) and i need to upgrade all of my wristlets and crossbodies to accommodate it's size. add a case on top, even a slim supcase, and it's even bigger. this is a non-issue for me, but it's something to be aware of. as far as real problems go, the phone is huge and to have the speaker up to my ear puts the microphone far away from my mouth so people say i sound distant until i shift the phone mic towards my mouth and the speaker away from my ear (so i can't hear them as well). curved face problems? still not enough from deterring me from recommending the phone. i'm also sad it's not water resistant like it's less beautiful and less gigantic sister, the s5. that made it a tough contest, but i am so glad i went with the note 4. also, the speaker gets very loud, which is something i love, and the sound quality with headphones in is superb. the display is incredible, the camera is great, android is intuitive and lets you choose your own os overlay if you don't like samsung's default (i much prefer yahoo aviate). i think the resolution looks better than any of the other phablets on the market, including the iphone 6+. i wouldn't switch to an apple phone in a million years with the performance i get out of the note 4. the extra camera features and s-health are nice touches but i haven't had need for wide selfie mode and i don't use the sensors except for the pedometer anyway. if one thing could be better with the camera it would be front-facing camera image stabilization, but i'm sure that's in the works. overall, it's an excellent phone. i strongly recommend it for the adventurous, large-pocketed/handbagged folks who want speed, dexterity, and beauty. hopefully durability will be next on samsung's phablet agenda .   phone works wonderful i love it and am so happy i ordered it .   love it, love it, love it .  still learing all the features, but i love the fast charging and the length of time the battery lasts. never got a full day out of my galaxy s3 without plugging in. now i get at least a day and a half, battery comes to about 50% power in 30 minutes, and only about 1 hour for a full charge. these are both with the phone turned off. it does charge also if you leave it on but will take a little longer. also, love the s-pen. still working with that. definately the best cell phone i've purchased yet .   love it. loved the phone - until i tried to take pictures. always comes out blurry. there is a hardware issue several people have with the phone. it is not software or forgetting to remove the film. just google "note 4 blurry picture" and you will find more info. my phone would not auto focus at all but if you would lightly shake the phone it would suddenly come into focus. it may or may not continue to focus for the next picture. this tells me it is hardware related (focus ring sticking) and has nothing to do with software, lighting, etc. i would encourage anyone who gets this phone to test the camera and if it takes blurry pictures do the shake test. if it suddenly comes into focus you likely have a phone with a hardware issue and should exchange or return it. if not for this issue i would rate the phone 5 stars because i loved everything else about it .   great screen resolution, cameras, etc. as mentioned by others. but very poor button design. the buttons are on opposite sides of the case and it's nearly impossible to not unintentionally press the button on the other side of the case when operating with one hand. i've unintentionally turned down the volume when turning it off and on, and unintentionally turned it off while changing the volume. the power button belongs on the the top of the case to make it easier to operate with one hand. the built in speaker buzzes at certain frequencies. very annoying. i just ordered an external speaker to get around this. (i exchanged my first purchase of this note 4 thinking i had a lemon. but the replacement acted exactly the same and also buzzed). the case barely covers the edges which looks great but it is very easy to touch the screen when handling it. the results differ depending on what you accidentally touched. i purchased a cover here on amazon which helped a lot. it's big but fits nicely into my pocket. the pluses outweigh the minuses so if i had to, i would hold my nose and buy it again .   this is a great phone. i normally purchase the tablet version of this phone, but when it comes to tablets i am an apple fan. this phone has a little lag now after a weeks use and thats fine for now .   this was a replacement for my note 2. better than i ever imagined. if you are wanting a new phone, this is the one to get. blows away the competition .   this phone is great! i love everything about it .   love it. upgraded from the note 2 and was a perfect upgrade .   so happy to have my new phone .  can't wait for it to finish charging so i can activate it .   a truly magnificent device. i had the note 2, "back in the day", and a number of phones in between and i keep coming back to this phone. i ordered a lg g3 at the same time i ordered the note 4, it was a tough call seeing how the g3 is a couple hundred dollars cheaper, but ultimately chose this, even in spite of the cost difference. here's the simple explanation: the "note" ecosystem is polished to a fine luster for large handheld devices and tablets .   and the display is pretty great as well. i've save my thoughts on the g3 for that review but it's a great phone as well and had i not used the note 4 i would have easily chosen it. on to the note 4. the screen is amazing, the resolution is incredible, which you may not think you'll notice but it will eventually show itself and you'll smile when you realize it. the camera is solid, a nice quick shutter speed and it takes good pictures in most lighting situations and you can record up to 4k video - so you can finally put that 4k tv that you just bought to good use :) the sound that comes out of the speaker is ok, nothing amazing but it's enough for the speakerphone to be solid and to hear music, if a little muffled. the front facing camera is actually impressive - i tend to take a lot of forward facing video so i can see myself with my son and the video always looks great. the s pen functions at least as well as the note 2 did, but with more thought put into it's usefulness - you get a small context window that pops up when removing the sylus, far more useful than the old "switch to this s pen page and use stuff there", i like it but have yet to find a great use for it. the default samsung keyboard, which is of course replaceable, is one of the better stock keyboards, i haven't switched it out for my beloved swiftkey yet, and i don't think i will. if you're a storage buff then you'll be happy with the micro sd card slot, it adds so much functionality to a phone that it boggles my mind when a phone doesn't have it. to each their own though. i can't think of a reason not to recommend it, aside from cost of entry. update 05-26-2015: the bluetooth audio has an intermittent issue where it cuts out, but the sound keeps playing, reminiscent of how a cd player would skip from time to time. this happens across multiple bt devices from headphones, a car and a sound box - i'm sure samsung would fix it, but i had the same problem with the s5 i had before and the note 2 previously, i think this is my last samsung device and i'll be selling it once the lg g4 comes out. caveat: a friend has the same device on verizon and doesn't experience the issue, so it may not be a problem with the phone, but if you're curious then do a google search for it and you'll find that this is not the only samsung phone that has the problem .   i paid full price on this ($699) because i didn't want to lose my unlimited data plan. at that price point this phone had to really impress. and it did. the screen is large, but not too large and it's crazy fast all around. the only "cons" are some of the verizon junk apps that are pre-installed, but it's easy enough to just not use them. all around i really like this phone .   i have had this phone for one day almost and all i can say is wow .  it's perfect .   best phone i have ever had. the features are awesome .   loves the phone works great. number #1 brand samsung, beats that not phone .   absolutely love this phone. i can even grade assignments with it and do work online .   i have had my note 4 for a few days i fine that it gets really hot. anybody have that problem .   i've been a fan of galaxy phones for a little while. i upgraded to the note 4 from the note 2 and it was very much worth it. great jumps in speed, stability and function. the camera is amazing and the screen is super clear and bright. and still this phone is easy to pocket, put in a bag and carry in my hand. don't be afraid of the "big phone". once you go with it you'll wonder how you ever lived without it .   i've been a samsung fan for over a decade, televisions and wireless. started the wireless progression from galaxy s though s2, note 2, galaxy s5 and now note 4. the note 4 has the best processing power of any mobile phone i have ever seen. on top of that, you get the incredible s pen, and the even more incredible 5.7 inch amoled display. leaves the new iphones in the dust. really .   it has all i needed and more .   great phone. love it so far. quite simply, the best phone on the market today. camera is superb. screen is amazing. battery life is one of the best available. very few negatives to speak of. i don't understand why samsung does not include the qi charging back built in. i know it has fast charge built in, which is amazing btw, but i am leary of the tech. i don't mind using it in short intervals, but for over night charging i prefer a slower charge that i feel will put less stress on the battery. in addition to that, it will save stress on the micro usb port. another negative is samsungs touchwiz software. i prefer the vanilla android found in the nexus line, but the phone outshines the n6 in just about every other category. the biggest negative with this phone is actually an at&t issue. they ship this phone with a locked bootloader. you are simply not able to root this phone at this time. and unfortunately, it comes with a ton of bloatware from at&t that you can not remove. you are able to disable most of it, which is nice, but it will still be on your phone, just not active. there is talk about it becoming rootable after it is updated to lollipop, which should be happening very soon as it has already started being updated in russia. all told, i am confident that this is the best phone in the market today. it is not quite the perfect phone, none are, but it is a purchase you will not regret .   that was great. thanks .   i love, love, love this phone .   dear samsung: the blue led light keeps blinking even when there are no notifications on the phone / notification bar. the screen activates by itself (turns on) when the phone is by itself on the table or couch. no one touching, pressing or waiving anything in front of the phone. the notification sound keeps going on even though there are no notifications. restarting the device doesn't solve the problems .   i love my galaxy note .   i've had this phone for about 5 days and i love it! it's fast and chargers with spend. i highly recommend it to anybody debating to get this or not. gr8. perfect for our needs and activation through the amazon info was a "breeze.". i love this phone .   too many features and perks to list .   best smart phone i have had in eight years .   just what i wanted .  nice phone with large screen .   i like this phone very good easy to use and easy on my eyes. absolutely the best phone i've ever used. i previously owned an htc evo and an htc evo 4g lte. my samsung galaxy note 4 blows them both out of the water .   loving it! great battery life, stable and the camera is great .   love it .   excellent product and is light years above my last droid .   i love my new phone, but i didn't receive the ear phone. we're they supposed to be included? anyone else with this problem .   definitely thinner than the note 2, seems a little narrower. i love it though .   great phone. bought the phone for full retsil price and came unlocked just like i wanted it to. works with verizon and other gsm networks .   love this phone .   i love my phone, still learning how to use it. but it is does everything i need .   great phone! love the updates from the note 2. its a large format phone, but doesn't feel too big in my pocket. screen resolution is great .   going from an apple iphone 4 to this new android phone was a jump but with help from techy friends and lots of online searches i really like the note 4! the camera is amazing, being able to us the step counter option is nice to help track fitness goals, all the app options let you get more specific to what your wanting out of a phone-way note than the iphone. highly recommend this phone to those who are very computer literate and to those of us that aren't-you'll live this phone .   excellent. great buy .   love it. you can do all sorts of things with this device .   this phone does it all. very easy to use and the s pen is very handy. i didn't think i would use the s pen much but it has been very useful. makes cutting and pasting and cropping images much easier. it took a little getting used to how big it is but i got over that quick .   was brand new .  in excellent condition .   one of the best phones i have used to date. there is no issue with it as of yet .   lives up to the hype? the battery time is good, the dual app usage is good and the wi-fi calling helps. the only major difference between this and the 2 and 3 models if the battery time and newer apps and compatibility. not worth the extra big bucks if you already have 2 or 3.  .   good. love it  .   i absolutely loved my note 4 the only problem is my s pen keeps going out. just can't beat it. love it .   outstanding device. works perfectly. packaged well and arrived right on time. one of the best phones i've ever owned .   awesome love it. excellent .   absolutely love this device. i use the s-pen 10x more than i thought i ever would. i highly recommend this. i absolutely love my note 4! it has meet all my expectations. my 14 year old nephew recommended it and i am so glad he did .   love the phone! no complaints. my son bought this for his new phone and says he can do anything and his phone will survive, and it does look sturdy. generally he kills a phone a year, so i'm hoping it works well .   good battery life. good picture. big screen. thin yet. can't browse and make calls same time .   very powerful device! battery should last all day (not for me as i am a power user). the super amoled display looks amazing and has beautiful deep blacks, but the viewing angles aren't great. past 45 degrees there is notable distortion in color which is to be expected with this type of display. build quality is great, feels really good in the hand. very satisfied overall .   it is all and more than i expected .   omg i love my new note 4 .   every time i take pictures with my note 4, everyone around me wants to know what kind of phone i have, they see the pictures and say "oh please send me those pictures because they're great!". so the camera is fabulous! i'm just starting to learn how to use the s pen but i love taking a picture of a document and then marking it up with the pen. my co-workers rely on me to handle these types of things on the go and well .  this makes me look good :) i honestly don't feel like it's over sized as many fear. i love all the options i have for fonts, backgrounds, color themes, voice mail videos, fit pedometer tracker, and so much more .   it's everything i need and everything i didn't know i needed :). the phone is awesome. however, the fingerprint security doesn't work most of the time .   received on time and as expected. great phone. love it .   bought this phone 18 days ago from amazon power button started to stick and become mushy and none responsive speaker also stopped working had a replacement sent to me which was also defective and packed very poorly waiting on the 3rd replacement to get here hopefully i get a working one this time. pretty sure i will never again buy a smartphone from here not worth the money you save imo after all this. bought it for my wife for christmas. she loves it. we took it to the verizon store in belvidere il and they set it up for her and gave her a few lessons on how to use the main features .   i lot better thank the iphone. moved from an s3 and have no regrets. super snappy response, bright screen, and gobs of features in new android os. a natural transition for existing galaxy users .   very pleased with the product and service. actually arrived early and as adverised .   it's the best phone out. all you apple fans are left out . nothing on the market can compare to the note. try it you'll see .   love it! easy to use! i have only had it just over a month or so, but so far so good .   so far so good .  love having a large screen-really like the hand writing note taking feature. after using the iphone 4s for the last three years, having the note 4 is like being a kid at christmas. and the best of it all is i paid $149.00 for it at amazon .   i love it. it is much easier to setup and use than i expected .   all 4 of us in my family (my wife and 2 kids) all have the note 4. the only problem with it is that this is the at&t version that has the bootloader locked, thus blocking root. therefore you get to keep all the bloatware that at&t puts on it. i personally went with the t-mobile version, which has an unlocked bootloader. my version has been rooted and a much cleaner version of the software on it. i get much better battery life than my wife (3hrs screen on time vs my 4.5-6hrs). but the phone is a great device either way and well worth the money .   groovy. my evo4g finally died after 5 years.so this thing is a beast.but sometimes you have to turn things off.this phone is so smart that there are somethings you just don't need all the time.like any tool you have to learn it.so i will have my hands full for the next few months.i purchased a 64gig card and a 10,000ma battery from zero lemon with a hard case.i charge my phone once every couple of days.the case is heavy but 10,000ma come on what do you expect?this is a good combo if you can deal with the size.but this phone is great.i don't use my table as much.i got this phone for $150 on amazon.for that price what more can i say.check it out. iphone killer .   overall this is a fabulous phone. i purchased it about a month ago because i wanted the best phone on the market and the overwhelming amount of features that this phone came with made it the top contender. pros camera - oh lord the camera. this is probably hands down the most amazing thing about the phone. people have literally gasped at the pictures and videos that i have taken. the image stabilization is amazing for anyone with shaky hands and the phone comes with more picture touch up features than the average user would ever need. for video there is the option to up the fps from 30 fps to 60 fps which makes watching fish swim a fun experience. ir blaster - this is probably my second favorite thing about this phone. the app that the ir blaster uses has a few annoying things about it but it makes set up a breeze so i can't complain too much. the app also has a feature where it will show you what is on tv and then automatically change the channel to that show, way better than surfing through direct tv's guide. overall i will probably never use another remote again because of how easy setup is screen size - so the pros of this are that it makes using your phone way easier. have you ever had that problem where you would just rather not use your phone because scrolling through a web browser with tiny text is annoying? yea well so did i until this phone. i am able to use this phone one handed with my right hand only because the back button is on that side. and yes i am able to text without any difficulty with one hand. the only problems that i have with reach is if i go from the home button to the top of the screen fast charging - amazing. with the right amount of settings turned off you can very easily hit the advertized 50% in 30 minutes that samsung claims, maybe a tad longer if you have a bunch of background stuff running. battery size - can't imagine running out of juice in a day. worst i got to was 20% in about 15 hours of use and i was using my phone a lot that day. but fast charging almost makes this point mute because it's that fast at charging. phone itself - so far i have had almost zero lag or freezing issues. the ui is very customizable and i've learned that if you want to change something, you probably can. the phone comes with a one handed mode which is very useful i just need to remember to use it more but it allows me to eat food and browse facebook at the same time so i'm happy. cons fingerprint sensor - great idea except for one small detail, you need to swipe. this make it nearly impossible to unlock your phone with one hand, like ever. if i were able to place my finger on the sensor like the iphone 6 plus then i would definitely use it but the phone is just big enough were you can use most of it with one hand and just big enough where swiping your thumb is very difficult. however using two hands changes everything and i'm able to unlock my phone on the first try 99% of the time heart rate sensor - so this is a minor thing, mainly because i don't know how heart rate sensors are supposed to work but this one is very sensitive to errors. i can usually get it to work but any slight disruption in just about anything and you need to restart. when i first got the phone it took me a solid 10 - 20 minutes to get one reading so keep trying new note owners. screen size - i know i put this in the pro section but that's just me. i value more of a computer like experience over a mobile one so the difficulties with one handed use are overshadowed by being more productive and having better hardware ( yes that is one of the perks of larger phones ). speaker - dear samsung, never put your speaker on the back of a phone, ever again. it is very easy to cut the volume of the phone down to about half if it's laying down screen up. so if you listen to music a lot get used to flipping your phone the "right" way. notification icon - it's always blue. my old phone was green for messages, blue for facebook, and yellow for snapchat. samsung fix this for the note 5. overall it's a great phone and the cons i mentioned aren't that annoying to me that would warrant a four star but they might be more important to some people than others. if i didn't mention something it's probably because it's not that big of an issue. yes the s - pen is cool but i wouldn't say buy or don't buy because of it .   the kick stand fell off, and when i put it on speaker phone people always tell me that is hard for them to hear me, i think it is defective how do i arrange to get a replacement .   what's not to love? i did think i would use the stylus, but i don't. great phone. great phone. note 4 is much improved from note 3 .   my boyfriend loves his .   love it .   love it .   got it fast and seems to be as described. this is my first smart phone so it is a bit of a learning curve but the phone is awesome .   where do i begone this phone is amazing i am so happy to have it .   you can read the review and judge for your self but amazon as always deli've red there product on time no hassle no issues will buy again possible note 6  .   u skip a gen. better and easier than i a non phone guy expected .   coming from the note 2 and the s4, it is no comparison. what is hated about these phones having a "plastic" feel, will not be found on this phone. the stylus is much more refined and the screen is the best i've seen. the options are endless and the camera is by far my favorite feature .   very slow! picture take for ever to snap not worth the money .   i switched to iphone 6plus and what a difference .   i got my lg g3 from amazon for 1 penny. having seen my wife's note 4, i almost wish i had gotten a note 4 instead, even though it cost 19,999 times as much ($199.99 on sale). :) wife was concerned over lack of physical keyboard, but is very happy with this phone. she didn't think she needed to upgrade, but says the note 4 makes her realize how many problems her old phone really had .   great phone. great camera upgrade from previous notes. nit much different than note 2 in size, but maybe better image. fast processing. still not much use for the s pen. don't like the s health tools much. fingerprint scanner ok option, but not useful if frequently unlocking phone with fingerprint. overall great phone. paid $150 on amazon .   love this item, still learning all its secrets. i was overdue for an upgrade on my galaxy s iii. there just wasn't another phone out there that i could get excited about until i came across this one. this phone is awesome. the specifications on it are better the specs on the iphone 6 plus. it has the best display for any phone on the market right now at 2560 x 1440 (quad hd) resolution, 3gb ram and amazing battery life with 3220mah battery. it also has a 16 megapixel rear camera and a 3.7 megapixel front camera. there are too many features i love about this phone to mention here. i highly recommend it. one more thing. fewer phones are providing slots for external memory. this phone take up to a 128 gb micro sd card .   i buy my phones full price to keep my unlimited data. my note 3 is now about 1 1/2 years old and i debated and reviewed multiple articles about the nexus 6 and the note 4. trust me, i read just about every site, review, forum,debate, discussion and comparison of the note 4 tot he nexus 6. i went to the store, looked at the nexus 6, the note 4, held them, played with them compared them. and .   i picked the note 4 and i am pleased and have no second thoughts. for those in the quandary, i understand there are people who hate the touchwiz interface. however, samsung does have several benefits over the stock android. yes, if you want to root, go to the pure android google experience, and want to spend your life on forums to download the latest google software, go for the nexus. but, if you want an out of the box experience, and do not spend you life trying to figure out how to upgrade, improve, overclock and get a custom experience on your phone, go to the note 4. i do not begrudge those who have to tinker with their phones. however, for those of us who put in 14 hour work days, and use the phone as a tool, not a hobby, the note 4 is the best. the sidesync 3.0 app makes the samsung choice great. this is an app that only works with the samsung. it allows you to mirror your phone exactly and use it on your desk top. great for using your computer to do e-mails, messages, or to just make using a cell phone app on windows. yes, there are other apps, none as simple as sidesync. also, samsung support is great. try calling them or contacting them. they have online support, chat, and they answer the phone. accessories are far greater for the note 4. more cases, holster, covers, etc. and, if you but the phone now, you get netflix free for one year and 50% off all samsung accessories on registration. great for buying a wireless charge or battery. so, great apps, great service, nice discounts .   yes, better then nexus 6. my wife loves it  .   nice upgrade from the note 2 and better picture quality. beautiful phone, works great, got to me overnight as promised .   great phone .   best phone ever .   it was good. so far i love this phone. it is far more capable than i even use it for. having moved up from a droid bionic, to the s4 and then to the note 4, this is the perfect screen size for my hands. i use it with both a normal case, or the samsung flip cover depending on my mood or car. i really wanted the edge, but verizon screwed the pooch on releasing that model. the note 4 is a better value for the price anyway. i still don't understand how people use apple products with their dated hardware, horrible os and marriage to the worst system ever, itunes. not to mention lack of memory expansion. this is my 2nd samsung phone and i've been extremely happy and don't see me swapping to anything else anytime soon .   the wifes favorite cell phone ever .   quick shipping and great device .   great phone. best free apps ever. love the size of the font and the size of the screen .   what can i say but awesome. the phone is worth every cent i paid for it. what surprised me was that this phone was 50% cheaper here on amazon than it was on the verizon store. i do advise getting the tempered glass screen protector and a case to protect this awesome phone .   my daughter got this phone for x-mas and she loves the phone. the quality of the pictures is great and it has a lot of features. she is still learning all the stuff it can do. the only thing i can say bad is the price was a little higher than i like to spend but that's the one she wanted to get. in comparison i got a galaxy s5 for my husband for x-mas for 50.00 dollars. the note was $ 299.00. everything is ,except i had trouble with the internet, but geek squad fixed it .   great product. note 2 to note 4 - and all is still good and stable. still have problems with apps on sd cards though - constantly warning of sd card been removed - when it has not. any apps running off cards cease. not sure why - it was the same with note 2. overall a better experience and a sturdier feel .   it's replacing the note ii. so far it's great and the buttons are in the right place. nice screen and i believe it utilizes 4g better .   no comments. good but sometimes bad reception. great phone, beautiful screen, it's worth the money. loving it .   better than iphone 6 and 6+ and the pen s is great cuz i have typing with my thumbs. it is a great phone. bought my note 4 from att cause i didn't get service in the field. this phone is worth the money. it's big with a great screen, slim design, and amazing camera. the battery last all day on automatic brightness and when the battery does run low, the samsung adaptive charger charges the phone really fast. for a big phone with bright screen the battery holds up well. the stylus pen has really good features and fits flush in the phone, not sticking out. overall it's such a great phone i bought my girl this white one .   i love this phone. it's pritty easy to get use to but i'm sure i haven't even come close to learning what it is able to do .   a lot of cool features .   but one thing a appreciate the most is the improved battery life and fast charging capability. one full charge can last a whole day with significant usage .   phone is awesome. everything i wanted and tons of customization options to name it personal. definitely better than iphone in my opinion .   love my new phone. no problem when i called verizon and asked to have an upgrade date transferred to this phone. i bought the phone on amazon and entered the phone number that had the available upgrade. when i received the phone, i didn't activate it, called verizon to make the switch and then verizon activates the phone .   great phone! i love it .   takes awesome pictures .   still figuring out everything it can do,b but so far i love it .   great phone .   i've been using this phone for a few days now and my first impressions coming from a galaxy s4 are wow! the pure speed and responsiveness of this device is mind blowing! the screen and camera are amazing and haven't experienced any lag or jitters yet .   the main reason i purchased this phone was for the gear vr, the oculus vr for the note 4 has blown my mind and can't wait to get my hands on one of my own next week! but even without the gear vr this thing would easily top any phone from 2014, and probably any other phone until the s6 comes out around may! go buy yourself the note and see for yourself .   excels the competition .   purchased for my wife and she loves it .   i'm switching from iphone which i've owned since the very first one. i have to say i love this samsung .   love it .   love it. i bought it for my husband who absolutely loves it! he had a note 2 and was due for an upgrade. the new features like the heart rate monitor, pedometer, fingerprint id & better camera features are great additions .   fast delivery .   i'm enjoying my galaxy love all the futures on it .   i was hesitant about this phone because of its size,,,,,,but i love everything else about it and am no longer bothered by its size now that i found a wonderful case for it. the camera is absolutely awesome, and is already helping me save a lot of time i was spending editing photos for my business. now i can point, shoot, crop and post .   that is incredible .   there are so many apps that came installed, and no guide with it, but i downloaded the users guide and am wading thru it. the phone certainly has lots of bells and whistles, and it will take me a while ti learn how to use it, but i am extremely pleased with everything i have learned so far about this phone. i have been an iphone person for many years, but this one outperforms anything i have ever owned .   this phone is awesome. still figuring out all the features. battery life is great for a phone this size. just got the gear 2 and now i'm all set .   this is a great piece of technology at a great price ty amazon. excellent phone/phalet. my third note .  the note line just keep getting better and better .   i've had this phone for almost a month and i love it .   the pictures it takes are amazing. i upgraded from the note 2, so very little learning curve. don't hesitate .  buy it .   <3. love this phone, best phone ever .   great smartphone for me - beautiful screen, ingenious stylus, quick os, awesome features! so much to learn, many uses i'm discovering as time goes on. larger smartphone than most, a phablet, but fits my hands well. i can use one hand most of the time, but sometimes need two - certain typing situations or applications. some people ask "why didn't i get the iphone 6+?" and i reply "why should i .  " and they don't have an answer except "because it's apple." duh, no reason .   great phone. just beginning to "scratch the surface". excellent phone. i would by again .   love this phone and all its features .   i love it best phone. best phone ever made in my opinion .   it the best phone to use with the pin (fat and old fingers ) and it is fast. the battery life is great only have to charge once a day so no need for a second battery .   i've owned major samsung smartphone since the samsung droid charge (every galaxy s phone, every galaxy note phone) i've also owned several other devices from htc, lg, moto. i find myself always coming back to samsung. the galaxy note 4 is the most powerful handheld device i've ever had my hands on. the phones ui is very smooth, despite what some "bloggers" who are htc/iphone/lg fanboys say. applications open without any hesitation, there is absolutely no lag on either touchwiz or anything else on the phone. i root every single phone i get and put custom roms/firmware on them the second i get the phone. this phone is the first phone i've gone more than a week (now two months) that i don't mind rooting and putting custom roms on; this phone is plenty fast. the screen on the note 4 is the best i've ever seen on any phone. being a best buy mobile employee, i get to play and compare every single phone. i've compared the screen of the note 4 to the new moto droid turbo and lg g3 which also have 2k or qhd (quad hd) screens and the super amoled screen on the note 4 is still sharper, better saturated, and just wows you each time you look at it! battery life is what is expected of a phablet. i get anywhere from 4-6 hours of screen on time (always on 4g, screen on high brightness all the time, gps and bluetooth connected) with anywhere from 2-3 hours talk time, and after 20 hours usually. that's all in a days work i put this phone through. with normal usage, screen on auto-brightness 1-2 hours of screen on time, 1-2 hours of talk time, i can normally go a couple of days without having to recharge. the s-pen is what sets the galaxy note apart from all other phablets. there are lots of phones out there with large screens now, but what sets the galaxy note apart from all the other pretenders is the s-pen. the all new spen technology along with the wacom digitizer now has over 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity making writing, drawing, and taking notes feel more natural like writing with an actual pen on paper. build quality has greatly improved over the previous galaxy phones, the new metal trim on the sides makes the device feel more premium, although almost everyone will put a case on it anyways, it's still nice to see it and feel it whenever you take the case off. also the back still has that faux leather feel, i don't know why so many bloggers always hate on this look and feel? i actually prefer this over the metal or aluminum back on the iphone or htc one phones. they are slippery, slick, and don't have any grip. also it's cold in the winter, and hot to touch in the summer. i prefer the leather back look and feel as it also helps with grip, especially for one handed usage and being a larger phone. as i mentioned, i've owned the galaxy s2, s3, s4, s5, note 2, note 3, htc one m7, m8, lg g2, moto x, and the note 4 is the king of all phones. you may have realized i didn't mention the fruit phone, i've also used and played with each one of them, i have not personally owned an iphone, but i am forced to use and know the ins and outs of it, i know more about the iphone and ios than probably 99% of all iphone users who have owned iphones since the original iteration of the iphone. the iphone 6 or 6 plus is not even worth comparing to the galaxy note 4, the note 4 is superior in every single category and aspect, it's not even close .   bought this for my husband for christmas and he is in love! it's an amazing device. definately an upgrade from the note 3 .   best phone ever! i've owned all of the galaxy s series and was prepared to continue along that path and pick up the s5 when it came out. ended up waiting for other reasons and after reading up on this phone i decided to get it instead. i love it! samsung has really put all of the bells and whistles into this one this time. would recommend to anyone .   the best samsung phone ever made .   amazing! best phone in the entire universe. i always thought that the note phones were too big, but i wanted to give it a try. i'm never looking back, this phone is amazing. you won't regret getting it .   this is samsung's "flagship" phone and is pretty expensive for a reason - because it's awesome and works great! got it for the wife for xmas. she has an online business, and the larger screen and stylus makes it much easier to run things while she's on the go or even just running around the house. we've had several samsung's (galaxy siii, s5, note 3) and they've all been pretty solid devices. i bought this direct from amazon, and then a few days later samsung price dropped it in half! when i called to return it so i could buy the other one from samsung instead, amazon price matched it and just refunded me the difference, which was really great since it was already wrapped under the tree at that point and the exchange process probably would have ruined the surprise. it was my first time dealing with amazon customer service and i was very impressed. they were great and very easy to work with .   the perfect do everything phone .   i previously had a note 2 and this 4 has lots of improvements. the challenge is learning how to use everything. i doubt anyone would use everything, but then everyone would fine something useful. the s-pen is incomparable .   the best phone in the market. just great. love this phone .  looks great .  battery life is awesome! a definite must have .   love it .   i upgrade from the note 1 to the note 4 and i love it. the phone is fast and the build on the phone is great .   great. awesome .   i love this phone!  .  not on sprint! the note 4 is an amazing phone, and sprint does an excellent job crippling this masterpiece of technology. data is disabled, while you are talking on the phone, unless connected to wifi. "sprint spark" is the culprit. i promptly returned my phone to amazon, after learning of this detrimental aspect. verizon is my new carrier, and this is not an issue at all .   my wife is loving it so far. it is fast, beautiful and she loves the big screen and ability to write memos, etc. still early yet and she has not given the camera much time to evaluate. a lot like my s5, but with the stylus, write ready, a little faster, more on board ram and a bigger screen. best price i could find around the holidays was at amazon .   this is the best phone i've ever owned i love all the features you should get it .   epic. excellent. a++++. i love it. the best phone i've ever had .   no problem .   miss my old trusty note 2 but the note 4 has more going for it. i came to love the note 2 phone. had it for two years and was never disappointed in any of its various up and downsides. i'd still have it but came to realize that the technology curve moves on, products either get better or replaced so on that soberting note (no pun), i upgraded to the note 4. i'm in the early stages of learning the note 4 so this won't be a tour de force review of what it is, can do or be. the love of the note 2 is why i chose to go with the note 4. so far, that trust seems worth it .   i'll never learn all the capabilities of this phablet, but i like it more and more .   is exactly as i expected. very happy with this phone. best phone i ever had .   best price around. i was a little afraid it would came here used or broken for being half the price of normal places. but it came in perfect and i love it .   phone works beautifully, my only regret is that i didn't get a case with it right away .   great, powerful phone for business and personal use. i am able to take notes and run calculations while talking to clients with mulit-view. i can also get two full days of normal use from 8am to 11pm with phone, text, web, gps, multiple email accounts, google drive and apps on one charge. i range between three to four days on just email, text and phone only without gps. i might get more if i wasn't synching seven accounts very often. the supplied charger charges my phone from 7% to 100% in about one hour. being able to swap out my 100gb sd card in the middle of recording our christmas celebration was a life saver when i ran out ofor space. this is the best phone i have used yet .   yes. the best phone .   i had no upgrade option from verizon so i just bought this phone outright. expensive, but definitely worth it. the nicest phone i have ever owned; upgraded from lg g3, which is a nice phone, but didn't work for me; for some reason i just didn't like and couldn't read the high resolution screen in a 5.5" package. i just couldn't read the screen very well (45 y.o. male). the note 4 is easy to read and the best phone yet for my eyes. the fingerprint scanner has some issues with the thumb; i couldn't get it to unlock consistently at all. i have read that the index finger works better. the camera is very nice and i feel works better than anything else thus far. i think most people are going to say these things, as the new phones are so much better that the previous generation (for the most part). the note 3 just wouldn't receive phone calls or texts. i had it replaced, but still it sucked. it was the best pda i'de ever owned up to that point, but didn't function as a phone. the note 2 was also very awesome, but this phone is so much cleaner and so much nicer to read. i have read that it is un-rootable as of yet, so this concerned me, as i am a heavy 'rooting' fan, with the desire to install customized roms and boot loaders. but i was able to copy the files i needed from my rooted lg g3 with root explorer (of course) to locations i thought impossible, on the note 4 (also with root explorer). i was very impressed. i was able to get everything running like i wanted, except for ad blocker, which of course needs root. other than not having root, ad blocker, mobile hotspot, and some other minor things, this is an incredible phone. i'll give the lg g3 to my wife as an upgrade to her s4, and then we will have rooted hot-spot for the kids' devices .   awesome phone .   this was my gift to me. i had the note 3 and wanted the note 4 the improvements made by samsung are amazing. vibrant colors and longer battery life. i love it .   the galaxy note 4 is a great phone and if you need a large screen i highly recommend it. for some reason i had a problem connecting to the wi-fi system in most popular business establishments that offered free wi-fi. after having zero success trying to troubleshoot the problem with att technical support department it was determined that the phone was defective .   just more than what i expected. love the note feature specially when i do not have look for paper and pen when i need to take a note during the call. very nice phone, even nicer when i learn all that it can do .   awesome phone .   i love this phone .   its everything i wanted. the only negative thing i can say is that the camera has a slight delay when you hit the button .   absolutely love it.  .   very happy with it! best phone i've ever had and better than anything else out there. and believe me i did my research and have had ios and android in the past .   overall experience has been good since i purchased it in late november. i use it a lot for general web browsing and email. i was a little anxious about touchwiz with all the negative comments in press reviews but i don't find anything wrong with it (coming from htc evo 4g). battery life has been fantastic compared to my old phone. i can go days without charging and the charger is very fast. the email app seems to work well with s/mime email which my old phone didn't. i've toyed with the spen some and think it will be useful with a little practice. i still use a daytimer at work and wonder if this can replace it. love the ability to cut and paste images and take screen shots. the ability to hand write notes should make shopping lists and memos very convenient. the spen accessory kit was missing from the box so i'm a bit miffed about that. the phone size is good for me. fits in my pocket fine. i can dial the phone and other basic stuff with one hand (i'm 6'1 male). i usually use two hands for email, web browsing, messaging, etc but i would on any size phone. people tell me it sounds better than my old phone. i find the white one quite classy in appearance and the build quality seems good. unlike some press reviews, i wouldn't call it cheesy at all, plastic back or not. and its a lot nicer than a certain new fruit product which i find slippery as ice. amazon had the best deal right after thanksgiving (199) when it was still 299 (and sold out) in all the stores around here. still getting periodic "no sim card detected message" .   moved to the dark side from an iphone4 and couldn't be happier. it will take a while to figure out everything this baby will do but that's part of the fun. haven't even touched the stylus yet but that's coming. i have xxl hands so the size is less of an issue for me than some. the bare phone felt too thin to me. the iphone had an otter box case that was too bulky for my tastes but i wanted to add some meat to the note 4 for comfort. put a caseology slim on it and it's perfect for my hand now. unbelievable camera on the note 4, which was a deciding factor for me. i am not disappointed and i've only scratched the surface on all this one does. i'm no technogeek but if you're just a user who's considering leaving apple, don't be afraid .   best phone i have ever had. it has everything you can ever need. great screen. great battery life. glad i decided to buy the note 4 over the iphone 6 .   i have used it for a month and really like it. andriod is much better than ios .   purchased online for my son at umaine, orono. excellent shipping with prime, excellent price, easy set-up with at&t contract .  approved within 24 hours .   had a galaxy s4 and was debating on whether or not to get this and by golly am i glad i did! this phone is awesome! luckily, i have big hands so i am able to use it one handed but if you have smaller hands you'll have to use the screen shrinking feature or use two hands. also, i thought i would never really use the pen but it works flawlessly and comes in handy at times .   apps download so quickly! also love the super fast charger. my previous phone was a galaxy s3, so i am familiar with samsung androids .   amazing just amazing that's all i really i have to say honestly. awesome awesome phone! kills the s5 on functionality looks and the screen is a loss for words because it's so sharp and so large .   love my phone/tablet combo. was a little weary at first about the size but it was a great investment. i only have to carry one gadget and it meets all my needs .   good. the best android device i've ever used. a worthy business device that can finally make it through the work day. nice updates to touchwiz to support multi-tasking, no compromise responsiveness, excellent pen for quick notes, and a truly gorgeous screen with amazing black levels .   absolutely awesome phone. i swapped from a iphone and never looked back. drag and drop music, movies, pics, etc .   onto the phone or sd card. memory is upgradable which blows apple away. stylus and note taking sold me .   love this phone. nothing not to like highly recommend this phone and would recommend it over iphone 6 .   this phone is incredible. completely customizable, and when you add a 64 or 128 gb sd card, it becomes really the only device you'd ever need. the s-pen takes some practice, but use it. it makes all the functions of the note 4 work how they were designed to. went from a galaxy s3 to this, and i can't wait to see just how much more i can do with this phone .   amazing phone as always. i buy every note because it is always the best .   best android phone ever. looking forward to lollipop update to make it even better .   great phone. really a great phone. i will start off by saying this is a large phone and i am a big guy. i have no issues using this phone one handed, but can absolutely see how someone with smaller hands might get sick of it. finally! i've been wanting a note version for my phone for years. the reason i didn't? samsung had this awful style approach that was to spend all of their money on the internals, which are very high end, but then slap a bunch of cheap looking plastic and a little bit of metal. i fully acknowledge that samsung internals, everything from operating skin to the fact that they have an sd card slot and a removable back and battery, are the best out there. i had an htc and my wife has a motorola. we hated them both, for very different reasons, but they felt well made and more expensive in your hand than any samsung device previously. with a metal frame and a textured fake leather back, this device feels expensive and "fancy" in your hand. the did a good job of keeping this style through the buttons as well. the stylus is a nice add on to your normal phone abilities. what amazes me about the commercials is that they show very specific tasks, like cutting images and such, which i admit is a nice tool, but the best benefit of the stylus is that it is very sensitive and keeps the screen, which is an incredible quad hd screen, clear of finger pints. now the sensitivity thing is important because even the fastest phones sometimes have issue getting exactly what your clicking on or swiping to do. with stylus you can fly through pictures, scroll websites (without touching the screen, just hovering), and swipe texting is crazy fast and accurate with it. if you're ok with the size of it, you'll love everything else about it. i would say go to a local phone store and give it a pickup first, just to be sure. i also check out the note edge, with the funky slanted screen. not only does the edge on that fancy screen feel rather sharp in your hand, it didn't respond very well when i used it. i read a lot of reviews saying the same thing, and i didn't feel it brought enough to the table to warrant the $100+ additional cost. it is also a thicker phone, so if you want a thin, sleek phone, go with the note 4 .   this by far is the best samsung phone .   i love it. everything i've expected and more. phone battery lasts for ever when not in major use, phone charges lightning fast, and the phone is a work horse. the os could use some improvements, but the flash support should be getting big .   it was a freat delivery on time great phone i give it a 5 star. such a great phone not much to complain it i saw both note4 and iphone6 plus in person .   but screen quality was hands down much better on note 4 much more crisp and easy on the eyes. great. overall, very pleased with this phone .   love it. i have had it for about 2 months. so far so good. just there are some unused apps that i wish i could have uninstalled them. overall is a very solid cellphone .   absolutely love phone. best phone by far  .   this is by far the best phone i've ever owned my entire life. seriously, is samsung did any more would over kill. the camera takes cri clear pictures.the highly customizable interface is the best on the market, i'm still finding out everyday more things to make this phone unique to my personality. video quality is also great, the wide selfie has finally but an end to cheek to cheek picture taking, you can even put a compilation of your favorite pictures and save it as an interactive lock screen or have your entire gallery float by when the device is charging. phone quality is good, i haven't had any issues with it.the pop up feature is great you can adjust the size of the screen or completely minimize it and a floaty icon will appear, very similar to the chat heads on facebook messenger. very convenient when multitasking. the upgraded s pen is simply amazing. it is impossible to cover every aspect of it, but to keep things short. i'd advise you to play with this device at a local carrier. overall, 5 stars i have yet to find anything to complain about with this device .   awesome phone, as i expected. also amazon was cheaper then sprint, go figure .   great phone. i own the phone (no freaking contract) and verizon started treating me well by giving me additional data to keep me as a customer. so far the phone is performing well and the enhanced s-pen function is great. what got me a bit unhappy that samsung is hinting on an upgraded note 4 with snapdragon 810 processor. oh well it is what it is .   love it, best phone i had, ever. love the phone, good screen size .  battery life is lackluster and it did not blow me away with new technology, i previously had an s3 that met my needs .   i don't know what to make of the wealth of positive reviews, both those of the buyers and the paid reviewers on the net and in the press. this is an unpleasant counter-productive thingy in many ways, especially for $800. at $200 i'd just throw it away. the phone is a technical marvel in every way, electronically and mechanically. so it can be fun to play with. and you'll being doing a lot of that, because unless you're a prior galaxy owner or a professional reviewer or tester, you'll be playing at trying to figure out how to do even the simplest things - good luck on the first try to answer a call, hopefully its a meaningless one. or you be paying samsung or att ( or  .   ) for apps that purport to be tutorials on how to use it -- if its so "seamless and intuitive) why would i need such a thing.) i'm used to a large variety of computer interfaces - several decades of programming and design, and i try to hold onto the child's attitude which makes it relatively easy for them to figure out how to operate such things and enjoy it. i haven't found that to pay off much with this. outside the technical realm the galaxy note 4 is mainly a sales gizmo which tries to trick and wear you down, your trying to avoid samsung and att (and  .  ) attempts to set it up so you'll be continually buying or refusing to buy (either way it takes a lot of time and irritation.) why would you pay someone to scam you constantly. the most sophisticated and studied process on the phone is how to defeat any attempt on your part to uninstall or disable their built-in (deeply built-in) apps that try to sell you stuff. its very easy to uninstall, or hide or disable (even unintentionally) the third party apps, good or bad. it can be very difficult (for a user) to get rid of anything that they have buried in the system to constantly feed you a new or reborn attempt to sell you (often along with a forever subscription piled on top) limp apps that are often just plain sad compared to the good third party apps. and once disabled/uninstalled, oops, surprise, sometime later there they are again, squeezing the apps you actually use off the home screen. one of the relatively expensive apps for the phone is one that suggests it can help with this. it is easily defeated by samsung and at&t's counter methods. after awhile, when at&t fills the screen you were trying to work on with an announcement that they're about to "update the software", you start to understand what they're really about to do. and when samsung announces that something is free or deluxe, pretend you're not a fool. its impossible to stop people from buying jewelry, the more expensive it is the better. this is pretty jewelry, but it also purports to be something that you could use to navigate an airplane -- hopefully that's rare .   love this phone. i tried iphone 6 and looked into a lot in 6+, but this phone beat them all. a lot of great feature i like which i do not find in my old iphone 5 and iphone 6. the only down side is gps sucks. keep stop working and searching for gps. hope samsung aware of it and can have this fix soon .   i absolutely love this phone .   disappointed that the product doesn't come in original samsung note 4 box .   very nice and good phone finger scan is no good iphone 6 works better camara is better in galaxy note 4. i usually buy top-of-the-line and keep my phones for long time. things that were important to me, when choosing the new android smartphone, were camera quality, battery that lasts and is easy to replace, ability to use the phone overseas, and plenty of storage or ability to add extra. all these things, carrier availability, and the desire to have the top of the line processor, pretty much narrowed my choice down to note 4, even though i did not particularly care for the size, and the stylus. i surprised myself when the phone arrived and i tried using the stylus (that samsung calls s-pen); i found the s-pen very useful, and now i take written notes with it all the time. the biggest negative of this phone is all the third-party junk it comes preloaded with, fortunately for the most part it can be hidden away so it does not bother you. the other negative is the large glass cover over the protruding camera lens. i am worried about breaking or scratching the glass, though a thick enough case should help protecting it. overall, i recommend note 4. it is a very good phone .   best phone i have ever owned. forget the amazing screen quality, the vibrant colors, the handy stylus and the great processing power .  the thing that immediately stood out is the great battery life. i cant tell you how handy having a battery that last a long time is especially when you use the phone as much as i do. the only gripe and its not even a huge one is that i think it has just a tad to much bloatware that you cant remove. you can hide it though which is nice .   excellent device, a very well executed update from last year. in land of large phones, nothing beats the note series. why just have a large device? and not have the features to take advantage of the large screen .   best phone ever! i love the size and the performance is great! super fast .   if you're already used to the note series of phones (or even just samsung galaxy phones in general), navigating this phone should be a breeze. it's faster and more responsive than previous phones and has less bloat, less flashy nonsense features no one will ever use, and an improved finger print scanner (which has a steeper learning curve than apple's, but is overall pretty reliable). as is standard for android phones, there's a ton of customization and if touchwiz offends you, you can easily switch to the google now launcher (or any other launcher, though i prefer the google now one for instant "ok google" voice activation). it is a huge leap forward from the my old note 2 and though 32 gb is not quite as much storage as i prefer, a 64 gb microsd card solved that for me nicely (a lot of apps have an option to store excess files on the sd card, like the camera, google play music, good podcasting apps, etc) and you can still move some apps partially to the sd card after they've been installed via the applications menu (though this doesn't seem to agree with the google now launcher which will kick the app's shortcut off of the home screen if it's on the sd card). the list of improvements is surprisingly long, so i'll just wrap it up by saying that samsung has managed to impress me by addressing many of my qualms about my older note 2 and adding a lot of competitive features (with minimal bloat). *edit:* so i discovered two things about my note 4 recently. first, the "galaxy apps" app (the official samsung app store) is missing on my specific phone (perhaps a verizon thing, as i have the verizon version). normally, most people would qualify this is as bloatware, but a lot of the native samsung apps on the phone can only be updated via this app, so i installed it (and it immediately updated like ten apps). also, as a bonus, samsung provides a few free premium apps and services to note 4 users (like one free kindle book per month if you install "kindle for galaxy", which is different from the standard kindle app that comes with the phone) that can only be installed via the galaxy apps store. (i found the full list of freebies on android central.) you'll have to sideload the apk directly from samsung (easily found using a google search), but handily, the note 4 allows you the option of permitting the installation of just a single apk (on an individual basis) without having to fully enable the "allow third party software" security checkbox .   i cannot say enough great things about this phone! i have been an android user for years now, this by far is the best phone i've ever owned .   can anybody tell me if we get handfree with new phone .   the phone is great but poor connection with sprint network. i have no connection problem with lg phone .   looks and feels better than expected. a bit heavy. not as quick as i was expecting. phone sounds great .   everything is good, i bought this for my fiancã© for her birthday. the only thing is that the battery wouldn't charge over 79%, left it charging all night and still only 79%, with three different chargers. had to purchase a charging kit with an extra battery from best buy, just for the extra battery. i put the original battery in the charging kit and i got the same results. so i wish there is a way amazon can refund me the $60 for the charging kit, because at&t said i would have to send the phone back and she would be without a phone for 2-3 weeks .   5 stars. no doubt. i will try to add something not already covered in the preceding posts. * some people say it is too big? well ymmv but the screen is so so gorgeous and there is so muck available that i will totally forgive the size. a friend has an s5 and another the htc one m8. easier on the hands maybe .  well perhaps a little, but huge sacrifice re screen real estate and the capabilities of the units. the note 4 trumps in terms of performance and screen attributes. * if you have any videos that you like to watch, omg .  the note 4 is just the best. * build quality is nice .  very nice. * as a phone .  yes i do talk on the thing .  the audio quality both in and out is excellent. i think smart phones will gravitate to the 5 to 6 inch range. the note 4 is there now. i love the fact that you can access the battery and that up to 128 gb micro sd cards can be used. iphone fans can not to that. music out to a bluetooth speaker sounds great ( anker mp 141 . if you used a bose or other high end .  it would sound even better. as of december 2014 some of the popular choices include samsung s8, iphone 6/6+, htc one m8, and the samsung edge. go to a store .  compare the units. you'll be hooked on the note 4. the unit sells itself .   very good. i bought mine from amazon. it was delivered as expected with guaranteed delivery in two day shipping, no delays. the device is amazing. i owned the first note and the galaxy note 3. better design, much lighter, better screen and amazing camera. if you're from outside the united states or from the united states but travel a lot and are planning to buy an unlocked phone; remember all lte phones from verizon are unlocked. i'm from honduras, central america and i inserted the sim card from an international carrier the moment i unboxed the phone and it worked perfectly fine .   love love my phone! came in great condition and i was able to to activate it with no problem. this is the second phone i bought through amazon .   amazing phone, my wife loves this handheld pc. she has been using iphone for the last 4 years and had the iphone 5 most recently. she had no problem setting up the phone and found it very easy to use. now like the new iphone 6 plus, this is a very large phone. it is so powerful that it is more pocket pc then phone and you shouldn't need a tablet once you own a phone like this. the battery life so far has been outstanding and the screen is so beautiful and easy to use .   very fast. screen is perfect for watching netflix .   love this phone ! i switched from iphone and have no regrets, i was able to transfer all my info and even my itunes very easily, it did take a bit of time to learn how everything works , watching youtube was very helpful .   best phone you would ever want to buy very good response awesome display the best resolution and one of the best cameras on any phone not just a phablet but one of the phablet on the market to me .   item arrived one day sooner then scheduled! great item awesome! blows away any iphone and is a big upgrade from the note 3 .   it's like watch an hd tv with cool apps. i would like to thank amazon for such fast service in replacing the first phone. i love this phone and am glad i bought it at amazon. much more phone than iphone 6 plus which i took back. just can do so many great things .   i converted from my iphone to the note 4 and i dont regret it. the note 4 is gorgeous, works great, and has some of the best specs on the market .   absolutely great device. zero lag, incredible responsiveness, and monumentally impressive screen clarity. if your a power user with an eye for detail and love to take photos from your phone, go all day streaming media, and have a need for tablet functionality this phone is for you .   excelente phone .   great phone .  no need for a laptop anymore. this phone, or phablet, it the best mobile device out there hands down. the display is incredible, but i've seen on any device, 1080p and 4k video look amazing on such a large 5.7 inch screen! i'm new to the note series, have always had a galaxy. will not be going back. bought it without a contract and worth every single penny. features and apps are good, still finding new things out. the pictures are incredible, the 16 mp rear camera is no joke, and the 3mp in front is perfect. uhd (ultra high definition) video recording is an amazing thing, but for some reason it is limited to only 5 minutes of recording time. even though it has a 64 gb memory card installed. when i take it off of uhd video recording, to regular recording, it goes up to unlimited as long as i have available space. other than that, this phone is definitely the phone to have .   fantastic phone .  does everything you want and so much more. best one yet .   the best phone hands down. it all that i wanted ina phone/tablet. it beats any phone .   awesome phone! the only hard part is getting used to the size, but that was in part the reason that i bought it. it functions really well, and the learning curve was not too steep. the camera and video camera are amazing. samsung makes a great product. the wife has the s5 and i also have a note 10" tablet, and they all work incredibly well .   so far it's great, i have a note 2 for a few years. now i have to work with the note 4,. great phone. would be even better if verizon would stop trying to over load it with unwaneed apps and messing with the physical design for the express pupose of requiring users to buy stuff from them .   it was delivered on time .  great product .   i warred with the decision whether to get the note 4, wait for the nexus 6, or opt for the moto x (2014) or sony xperia z3. although i'm not a big fan of touchwiz or the considerable repository of unremovable at&t bloatware preloaded on this device, the phone itself is the best i've ever used with the possible exception of the oneplus one i bought for my wife. the screen is gorgeous, and the fit and finish are a marked improvement over previous generations of the note line -- and truly warrant the "flagship" device distinction .   only bad part is at&t will not unlock the phone until you have reached 6 months on go phone service. so now i cant use it to go out of the country next month. anyone wants to help me solve that problem feel free to give me some tips .   best big phone on the market today. samsung has its design flaws and software problems yes, but overall the best phablet out there hands down. pros screen battery life stylus camera metal trim cons software- touchwiz is just plain wrong, but is slightly better fingerprint scanner useless can't use with one hand (and i have big hands) photos come out over saturated and over sharpened. (again software problems). the best phone / tablet ever. loved my iphone .   love, love samsung galaxy note 4 even more! so many features and so much to learn .   so worth it .   the best .   i love the phone but at&t not so much .   i was on t-mobile network for the longest and decided to switch to at&t since i bought the at&t version. at&t service in my house is so horrible that i can't enjoy my phone. i definitely recommend this phone if you are someone who like big phone, by the way its not as big as i thought. you have a nice big screen without the unnecessary space around it like iphone 6 plus who has a bigger phone with a small screen size i have gotten my first 3 phones including the note 4 from samsung because i simply thought they were the best company but i guess i was wrong. ever since i had my note 4 whenever my battery life reaches 20% then my gps mode turns on. it never been a big issue until recently so i called samsung customer service to see if there was a settings i can do to turn it off so gps won't automatically turn on when my battery is dying, they had me on hold for 2 and half hours and they hang up the phone.i thought the line cut off so i just called back the next day and the same thing happened so i now knew it was intentional so i called again. someone finally answered and tell me that because my phone is out of warranty they couldn't help me meanwhile my phone was barely one month over the warranty. i had other products from apple and they still services their customers even after the warranty runs out. this will be my last samsung item i purchase because they don't stand by their product .   awesome .   love this phone. the delicate exposed metal band is the only thing keeping it from being a 5 star device. it scratches and is easily damaged .   first time owning a phone that is that big  .   its a great device  .   top notch .   love the features, phone is hard to hold onto and select input with one hand. media is unbeatable, awesome sound for a phone! if you dont use blue tooth while driving you will need too .   best phone i've ever owned. samsung never disappoints. this phone is amazing. it's an endless world of features .   really nice phone and superb display quality .   great phone  .   no problems so far. great battery life compared to my old phone. amazing screen .   the size of this phone is perfect for those of us who need to be able to read the screen. as a previous owner of an iphone 4, this phone makes a world of difference in readability. the sharp vibrant screen is easy to read. the font sizes can easily be adjusted. i am on my second day of use and the battery is still at 54%. the phone takes very good pictures and does not feel heavy at all. i haven't used the stylus, but one wife loves it to write chinese characters. the phone is full of features that i enjoy using. the ability to take pictures by using a word such as "smile" or "cheese" and if i forget the stylus on my desk and walk away it sends me an audible reminder not to forget it. samsung outdid themselves with this phone, i am a happy user .   love this phone! screen is amazing .   love this phone! screen is amazing! when you pull up the camera it looks as good as the real thing. best phone of the year .   perfect phone. super fast and runs smooth. camera is amazing. my box was open so i had to return it :(. i received my note 4 couple weeks ago, and i loving it, but i have not received the headphones. really .   expensive phone with no headphones? did amazon forgot to included .   battery life is top notch, fast charging, and a very powerful device. it lasts all day for me on a single charge. only complaint i really have is quickoffice doesn't work on this. it won't let me save documents with it. so i just use the document app it came with. if you're looking for a top notch device with a large screen, look nowhere else .   note 4 hands down the best smart phone ever. it's a beast in different categories: screen size, battery life, screen quality, camera .   this is just ridiculous! the phone is locked to verizon and you can't use it with any other mobile service even if you get the full priced one (no contract). this is absurd! t-mobile (part european company) gives you full power over your phone. you buy a phone from them and on your request you can unlock it by sending you an email code. easy simple and you feel like being a happy free customer who can make his own cognitive choice. now these companies (verizon, at&t) want to treat you like a child who can't make up his mind. they want to lock every single aspect to never leave them. this is ridiculous. i called verizon specialists many times and each one has its own version of the story: one guy told me you don't have to worry your phone will work with any sim, one lady was trying to figure out what unlock means - she thought my screen was locked - then she put me on indefinite hold  .   one told me you can use it internationally but within us it's locked - so within the same company, no one seems to know what's going on in their own space. ludicrous. so avoid buying any phone except if it's international or t-mobile then you have your freedom to use it anywhere. the phone samsung note 4 is awesome. i will get it sooner than later. but i am sad i had to return the phone to amazon  .   i want a note 4 so bad :). it's perfect! kudos to samsung because the hardware and software are far exceeded my expectations. i just simply love this device .   god mode phone. love my new phone .   great for my massage business. i have always been a fan of samsung, and this phone has only strengthened mytrust in their ability to make fine electronic devices. this is however just my second full day of ownership, so i will update this as neededbut so far this phone is fast, reliable, and extremely fun to use .   like everything. one star less for not having headphone with the device .   why .   best phone i ever had. the download boost feature is killer .   i'll put in this disclaimer: i don't like apple. i do enjoy samsung but i'm not a fanboy by any stretch of the imagination. all of my applications are google-based purchases and double purchases would be silly so i've stuck with google-based products through the ages. looks - 5/5. this phone is gorgeous. i don't care if it bends (according to youtube.) mine lives in my pocket with a case around it that doesn't bend. the design is pleasing, technical with elegance and gorgeous with a strong sense of simplicity and utility. it is there and gets the job done and well. the metal accents definitely add a nice touch. feel - 5/5. it's light but strong. feed rigid, like i'm not going to break it. the screen has been exposed to some harsh environments from me and come back without a scratch (i'll be getting a screen protector anyways.) speed - 5/5. it's fast. very fast. in fact, so fast, that when everything was downloaded on it i was able to do my usual tasks that i did on my note 2 in less than half the time. this was mostly due to shorter load times and faster internet utilization. screen - 10/5. even if there was a dead pixel on it, there's so many on here and the pixels are so small that i would never be able to see it. the screen is gorgeous. the resolution is incredible. for reference as to how clear it is, there was an entire article in a google play tile (roughly 1 inch by 1 inch in physical size) and you could still see every letter clearly. you'll see what i'm talking about if you get one. the screen being an amoled has an interest effect in bright light. in sunlight, you can still see it clearly. the glass is not reflective so much. it blows the contrast way up so you can still see it and readjusts automatically when you enter a darker area. definitely an interesting (and probably standard) touch but my note 2 always had issues in sunlight. battery life - 5/5. it lasts. and lasts. and lasts. and .   well let's just say the energizer bunny probably has one in his pocket and runs out before it does. it's a 3220mah battery which is just a bit more than than the old note 2, but what it does with that battery is incredible. a lot of the usage comes from the screen and processing power, and i have both on full much of the day and the battery will only use 40-50% with a full day's use, no charges in between. oh, speaking of charging. the included charger is quick. i have 2.1a chargers everywhere that charge things up nice and quick, but the one that comes with the phone is unique. i've only had the ability to use the fast charger once (since i never run out of enough power to give it a good test) but it does charge at a rate of roughly 1 3/4%-2% per minute. it's fast. signal acquisition - 5/5. this is most to do with the network you are on but it also has a lot to do with the phone. i haven't had a single dropped call on verizon and even in places where it says 1 bar, i still get excellent 4g speeds. this is critical for my type of business when doing research or scouting. it's at least 5x as fast connecting and download as my old note 2 on sprint. the biggest issue on most networks is initiating the tunnel to download information for a particular website or app. this phone make that connection flawlessly. camera - 5/5. woo doggy this thing is good. it won't replace a true dslr but it makes small point and shoot cameras almost a thing of the past. the many features available with the standard camera app are great. i've used the panoramic view before it and it did an incredible job cropping the picture perfectly, even with non-smooth movements. voice calling - 5/5. again, partly a network thing but much to do with the phone as well. everyone is clear. everyone. everything. every time. people hear me just fine (except for one situation i will explain later.) never an issue with voice. much better than on ol' sprint. sorry sprint, i love ya .   but no. so now for a few of the things i don't like but i didn't feel were enough of an issue to take away a star. bloatware is on this device. the good thing about android though, is that you don't have to use it and it doesn't really detract much. some can be uninstalled but truth be told i don't really care for it being there. speaker phone has a slight issue. while the speaker in the back of the phone is perfect, crisp and clear, apparently people have an issue with hearing me on speaker phone sometimes. i believe this to be a software issue that i might have to look into, but i haven't found it yet. i just figured it worth mentioning for those who use it in factory-fresh mode. it's a worthy phone. i don't know what the note 3 was like to compare but for a person who needs a utility phone for work and personal, this is an excellent device. i base my reviews on how the device works for my use, not comparing them to previous generations of products or other competing products. for my use, which i can dare say surpass the industry standard for requirements, the phone keeps up and then some. if you're on the fence, this phone will blow you away .   i love this phone! i don't have a bad thing to say about it other than some minor touch wiz deficiencies. a little lag with the software with a couple things. .but it's nitpicking in my opinion. this is a great phone. i have bigger hands, so the size isn't an issue for me, but something to think about if you have smaller hands i guess. i had an s4 a year or so ago, and i like the changes that have been made to the software and hardware since then. this phone feels great in the hand, not slippery. . .and the software continues to improve .   before upgrading to this phone, i had the galaxy s5. i was very satisfied with my gs5, but i knew i would benefit from the larger screen and s pen that the note 4 has to offer. right when i took this phone out of the box, the feel of the phone in my hand felt much more solid than the gs5. i love the matte trim and the leather back cover. after using this phone for a few days now, i absolutely love it. the display is much more vibrant and the screen is very responsive. the s pen comes in handy when taking notes and trying to click on the small tabs while browsing the web. i realized that the camera was much better than the gs5. it is now much easier to focus on close objects. this is definitely one of the best android devices you can buy right now .   good to go. i admit, i was brand loyal and kept a awful phone for no other reason than i was scared to leave. it was an unhealthy relationship. i upgraded from a motorola droid razr maxx hd. my first clue should have been the fact that there were too many variations of a razr for anything to be supported or even accessories to be available. from the get go, that phone was never close to the hype that verizon led everyone to believe. the giant battery never lived up to its promise. it was always dead at the same time, 8:00 pm, with no day charge- this is from day one. i persisted and enjoyed the few things about it i liked for two years. i finally cracked the screen because i quit caring about it all together .  which brought me to the note 4. before i made my decision, i received a galaxy tab 3 for christmas last year and i fell in love, which made my switch easier. the note 4 excels in almost every category. i was worried that 15 years of brand loyalty to motorola would make feel like i was missing something, after completely jumping ship to samsung, but i don't miss motorola one bit. the camera is amazing. brilliant, crisp, clear detail. bright accurate color. calls are clear. screen is brilliant. touch wiz doesn't bother me at all. the size is nothing, even with small hands it works perfectly fine. oh and despite the huge screen, resolution, active apps, location services running and pretty heavy use- i'm at 77% charge, 9 hours after pulling it off the charger. this phone is great. i'm extremely pleased and hope this survives the next two years so i can get a note 6. not to mention, because it is truly a flagship phone (not to be confused with moto's "flagship of the month" philosophy) i can actually buy cases for it. cheap ones, expensive ones, pretty colors, whatever. i believe there was one case available for the drmhd when i bought it and it was a hard shell for $30 at vzw. i bought three note 4 cases from amazon for that price- the same day i bought my phone. when otterbox releases their defender for note 4, i'll buy that, too. p.s. my isheep friends were ready to trade in their 5s for the new 6s and now they are actively considering note 4 or s5s, after seeing how much better n4 is to the i6 .   i love the phone but mine seems to run too hot .   the screen isn't on the highest and i don't have a case for it. after being on it for like 20 mins, the screen and back side are uncomfortably hot. also the battery seems to die faster than my note 2 (when on full brightness). did i get a bad seed .   i upgraded from the now ancient samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket to this baby. it is totally awesome .   beautiful screen tons of features only samsung galaxy note 4 can give. go samsung. phone arrived oct 28, 20 days after i ordered it. phone would not activate either automatically or when i called verizonwireless. i spent 2 1/2 hours on another phone with amazon and verizonwireless before it got activated. i signed up for the verizon wireless more everything plans with the 250 mb option. someone at verizon commited fraud and changed the plan to 500 mb at a cost of an extra $5 a month. verizon online has no way to correct this. i got an email from amazon-csc@amazon.com but when i answered the email the mail got rejected by the amazon mail system. actual email from amazon-csc%2bazr76bej954tf@amazon.com. i already reported the fraud to verizon. this is my first bad experience with amazon, but i have had many problems with verizon billing. updated oct 30, 2013: verizonwireless finally contacted me and corrected the problem with the 250 mb plan. they currently do not anymore have a 250 mb plan but let me keep the 500 mb plan at the old price. i updated my rating from 2 to 3 stars because i am very disappointed in the speaker sound quality. i am retired, 74 years old and spend most of my time sitting in an easy chair. my old cell phone was 10 years old and i could not text with it. i also will be using this phone on the internet a lot, but the display does not handle internet sites very well. i did install lastpass app to manage all my passwords since i log onto 85 different sites with different and complex passwords. my debit card info was hacked on home depot and target sites. also someone somehow got a copy of all my email contacts and sent email to all my contacts. this information was only stored on google .   it works very well. i love my new galaxy note 4. i switched from an iphone and its the best decision i could have made. the picture quality is the best. i love the selfie pictures and regular pictures i am able to take. i love how fast it is and it doesn't feel like it lags. the s pen is great and it has a lot of features. my favorite is if you want to update your facebook status, you don't have to type it, you can simply write it and it will convert it to the typing format. how cool is that? the screen quality is amazing. so vibrant, clear and i think its the best screen out there. the fast charging is amazing. it charges in 30 minutes or less. great feature. you don't have to wait so long for it to charge. overall this is a great phone and i love it. i feel like i made the right choice .   what more can you ask for in a phone? :) the note series keeps proving it's one of the best out there. i thank amazon for a pretty fast shipping as well. switching from note 2 to 4. can't ask for more. perfect phone .   i love the note 4, but hate that at&t locked it down like no other! you pay more than the t-mobile variant, yet it comes with more bloatware, and a locked bootloader. i knew this ahead of time, so i can't really complain, but i miss the old days of the note 2 being so opened. with all that said, this is one hell of a phone. i've had all the iphones(with exception to the iphone 6), and had the note 2 and 3.i can positively say that the note 4 is one pretty damn good phone, and the best one available. the iphone 6+ just does nothing for me. the only phone that will be comparable to the note 4 will be the new nexus 6 .   pros: 1. looks and feels beautiful and premium. 2. best screen i've ever experienced on a mobile device. 3. buttery smooth software. i've not noticed any lag in any application. also it's very intuitive and functional. 4. the camera is great, much better than my friend's iphone 6+ 5. it's feature rich, and the features are actually very useful, (very few gimmicks) - love s note, direct call, s pen, multitasking, drag and drop feature, universal remote control feature, clipboard, screen write, image clip, smart select, action memo, the awesome gallery and it's numerous features, one handed operation, etc 6. the s pen brings so much to the table. some people think it's just a dumb stylus but you should watch a few youtube videos on the s pen 7. the battery is great, much better than that of the note 3. it also helps that the battery is removable 8. you can also expand the internal storage by 128gb more with a micro sd card (that give you 160gb of storage) 9. lound and clear call quality (louder than note 3) 10. excellent sunlight legibility 11. love tap to pay with google wallet cons: i'll update this review with any i find with time. i highly recommend this phone above all else and i've played with the iphone 6+, lg g2 - both are not worth it compared to the note 4. they're just large phones that don't bring much to the table besides larger screens while the note 4 also brings tons of intuitive and useful functionality to the table. if i dropped and shattered this phone today, i'd buy it again in a heartbeat. i paid full price and i believe it's worth every dime i spent (especially since other phablets that don't offer half as much as this one are being sold for the same price or more). i just bought an m8 less than 6 months ago. ever since i got it, my wife has loved it and wanted it. now it was her time to upgrade. so, i gave her my htc one m8 which was in mint condition and i got a galaxy note 4 on her upgrade. so, i got a chance to compare the two mighty flagships of this year, although meant to cater different audiences. i am not going to bore you all with a detail of specs (they are more available than you desire on any tech articles). below is my brief gist of similarities and differences between two devices: 1. i really like the 0.7 inches extra real estate available on the note 4. 2. i could not feel much of a difference in screen quality honestly between the m8 and note 4. m8 has better whites, note 4 has slightly yellowish whites and better blacks than m8. 3. s-pen is a huge positive if it can be of use to you. i personally think i will find it very useful in my job. 4. the tests done by professionals show note 4's and m8's battery to be equally lasting in terms of screen on time. i felt note 4 has an edge in that regard in daily use. 5. premium feel and looks of m8 are leaps ahead of note 4. note 4 has improved a lot with metal edges though. 6. boom sound speakers of m8 provide a much better multimedia experience than samsung's hind facing speaker ( i don't know why would you put it there) 7. 16 mp camera on note 4 is much better than m8's camera. i do however think that m8's camera is criticized more than it deserves. i clicked and printed some pictures of flowers from botanical garden and the quality is nothing short of supreme. 8. htc sense 6 any day is better than any samsung touchwiz. but you can install a launcher from playstore so that makes it even for both htc and samsung. 9. both note 4 and m8 are equally smooth in their functioning. m8 is obviously better in one hand functionality. 10. selfie camera on m8 is 5 mp and note 4 is 3.7mp. but note 4 has panoramic view which comes in handy in most party selfles where all friends want to get into one picture. i think panoramic view makes note 4 even with htc m8 in selfie aspect. so, in general i think both m8 and note 4 are amazing phones for this year. they cater to different tastes. as far as other flagships of this year are concerned, i would however recommend staying away from samsung galaxy s5 as i don't think 2 gb ram is enough for cramping touchwiz. on top of that, a plastic body is just a big no. lg g3's colors look washed in front of m8 or note 4, but is otherwise a great device. i haven't had an experience with moto x 2014 but i believe it will be great device. i could have waited for nexus 6 but 5.9 inches is too much for my hands. apples were not even a consideration as i did not want a blown up i phone 4s. this is all in my opinion, obviously everyone has different priorities. i do want to recommend to everyone to try different launchers. it spices up the android experience (something ios will never enjoy). different icon packs, themes, new widgets all bring a lot to the table. and how can i forget tasker! a single app which if anyone learns after an initial curve, can do so much with their android device! it is unimaginable! go android .   update: a word about the fast charging, i think this is a big strength that is missing from a lot of flagships. even if you are down to 20% in the middle of an evening (i am working more than 24 hours straight in a hospital frequently), during my dinner time of 15-20 minutes, i can put it on charge and get up back to work with 60-70% battery, which can almost last another full day in some cases. some people just get up in the morning and charge their phone for an hour before leaving to work, and get full 100% from 20ish. this is awesome .   good and does what it advertised. awesome! this phone is amazing here are the pros and cons: pros: long battery life(2 days worth more ; than iphone 6 plus) quad hd screen(more than iphone 6 plus) s pen(great for notes) premium finish cons: none currently. i love this phone  .   i preordered it off of amazon . it was not suppose to be here for 2 days i received it on release day! thank you amazon .   this is my 1st android phone. i switched from the iphone 5. so far i love it. it is a little different than ios and will take a little getting used to but so far i realy like it.this really is a premium phone. it is extremely nice!i also ready like the leather back it feels really good in the hand.the screen is amazing! i find myself constantly useing the s-pen, i really like it! once you go phablet you don't go back .   love the phone its came the way u said it will perfect and on time. the phone is locked not as he said. i think you should sell what you described. it has more scratches than i thought and the camera does not run very well. my daughter loves her phones no problems so far as we had it for 4 weeks. received in good condition. it brokes. fast shipping item as expected. i got defective piece. very disappointed and had to return in 2 days. display started giving trouble within 2 days. i wasted my screen protector glass as well .   this is a marvel! works very good, this is my firths time my cell works every thing. i am so happy .   i love my iphone 6 plus that i recently purchased. it arrived on time and has been working perfectly. i love the larger size compared to the iphone 6 . much easier to read, text, etc .   love it .   seller sold me a phone that has the infamous iphone 6 and 6 plus touch screen issues. new chips will need to be soldered into device in order to maintain any level of functionality. looking forward to having to have this work done .   phone is good .   i bought my iphone

there. the battery life is awesome. close-up and normal distance picture taking are both great. i have noticed; however; that when i've taken pictures of my girlfriend at a little bit of a distance, say maybe, 20 feet away, her face looks a little distorted. but i love how crisp and clear my close-up "flower" pictures come out. beautiful .   good. seller was great and phone was as described!

tracfone uses them not at&t. i misunderstood which was needed in a sim card because phone isn't to be under a verizon contract. when i went thru set up on phone i didn't engage move ios to transfer data from android. you have one chance and can not go back and transfer data later unless you clear every out and start from scratch . so now i am entering manually many contacts . iphone needs to let

everything works fine. the phone was perfect as described but accidentally bought and the return process was easy will not hesitate to buy again .   brand new iphone very happy with it. when this iphone 6 plus arrived the shipping package wasn't secured, it was folded over like a 1970's sandwich bag! the box was filthy and stained! it had none of apples silver logo's imprinted on the box and didn't come with the manual that all new apple phone come with. after some research on refurbished and used phones it was more than evident that the phone wasn't "new" at all!the sim tray didn't have the serial # imprinted on it, the original serial # stickers were missing from the box and the serial # showed inaccurate date of manufacturer in conjunction with phone model! absolutely not as desribed! apple iphone 6 plus 128gb factory unlocked gsm 4g lte cell phone - space gray. this phone is absolutely perfect no scratches and it's shipped very fast .  shout out to a & z tech inc.

great price .thanks a lot. love my 6s plus .   i am just wondering where is my warranty for it .   nice. company went belly up. or tried to take my money and run .   the phone wasn't in the box. i am extremely satisfied with this purchase. quick delivery and the phone is just like brand new with original receipt and apple warranty until end of june, 2016. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. phone got here fast but it has scratches in all for corners , top volume button is jammed and also the phone freezes i can't even get inside of it , i'm getting a refund. a+. i am enjoying the ease of this phone and the workshops and games. it takes great pictures .   very nice. item was delivered late, packaged in a brown box (poorly, because the air nylon bags were out of air and the phone box was moving all over inside of the brown box). the phone looks good tho and it's box looks untouched as well. however, this phone will not be activated right away cause it is a gift. so, it will take me a while to discover if it is truly unlocked or not. we tried to set it up but it is requesting a sim card which we currently don't have. we are going to wait on it, then i will update my review after the end results .   the iphone 6 plus came as a perfect match. not good. good product. good. uhm, a little larger than i expected, but very nice. i upgraded my phone and my children's phones from iphone 4s es so these were a huge change. the screens are so nice, so much larger and these are much faster. a lot better for games and surfing the web .   very apreeciated. brought the phone from them but the screen didn't work and it didn't say it in the description do not buy from them. i'n very happy with the it. phone is awesome really good deal too .   great phone, great shipping. dope ðÿ‘. it supposed to be unlocked phone, but i coulden't unlock it even with the seller instructions .   now good. it is 128gb if i had problems with my screen no longer serve, i had to change into a money making up apple store .   i was hoping chargers are included and headphones. good value and as presented. seems to be working fine. did require a simm card and that was fine. worked with my verizon carrier .   very fast shipping and i received the way it was described. very pleased with my iphone thanx. item was in near perfect condition. everything worked. delivered on time. exactally what it said it was .   very satisfied with the item. works just as expected. phone is great, 128gb of storage. i would recommend seller quicknship. fast delivery very clean phone. one small scratch that does not effect view .   good choice. good. excellent product timely delivery highly recommended. every thing was good  .   phone was in excellent condition as advertised .   works great .   absolutely perfect used phone, not a scratch and works as a new one. i like my new iphone 6 plus .   i got this for my mom for christmas. i have not had a large phone for quite some time for myself but now i want one :) no scratches but was not in a oem box. charger cable and headphones were included .   great. was a little nervous buying a refurbed phone, but it's been working absolutely perfectly. was in near perfect condition when we received it. activated easier than phones we've purchased directly from verizon. love the size coupled with the lightweight of the 6 plus! highly recommend .   i love my phone took awhile to come but it's amazing next one i'm getting is the 6s plus. very good. good. good. looks and works very good. has a small scratch on the screen, but i guess that is why priced $50 lower than others. --does not bother me as long as i saved $ .   love it .   the phone arrived in perfect condition .   seller provided product just like advertised and has a really good cs. i thought i would find the size cumbersome, but now i can't imagine going back to a smaller screen. great for tv/video on the go! battery life is decent considering the size .   love it. perfect. imei locked. me llegom defectuoso. my iphone 6 plus is awesome i am so glad i went with on amazon to purchase my phone very satisfied. phone as good as brand new. nice phone. yes love it so i need some i phone 6 &6 plus unlock please thanks ðÿ˜š. so far, so good. the phone meets the requirements of my cell phone service provider .   great item i love it :). received phone and tried to power on nothing happened. plugged into charger nothing happened. i thought these phones were tested before shipping especially refurbished phones .   i really loved. true to this sellers word, the iphone 6 plus is excellent .   upset .   the headphones were counterfeit and i'm starting to worry if the phone is too .   highly dissapointed! i spend 500+ dollars on this .   terrific product. provider set it up without an issue. the phone was not unloacked. this phone has dead pixels in it. prior to buying this i read about it and no where did it state it had a hardware issue. i am very disappointed as i spent close to 500$ .   as described. shipping was super fast and very well packaged priced that cant be beat  .   apple 6 plus a nice up grade and very fast. it is in good condition and it's worth its cost. great condition! works great. not what i wanted; great product, came on time. everything ok. good. my looks new like never been used. but it was used. no scratches no dents no cracks no nothing just a grate phone. if i there's an option for no star rating, i will do it for this lousy phone for couples of reasons. it's a brand-new factory unlocked phone that i purchase less than 2 weeks ago. it works as supposed for the first few days but shows signs of un-stability in the second week. sometimes i have to press the home button twice to make it work. when i surf web on safari, the screen does not rotate anymore! i'm coordinating with the seller to get it return now. compared to a nokia 925 that i have been using for over a year, iphone 6 plus is suck .   ðÿ‘. apple is my family .   love it. great condition. yesss, i love it exactly wht i expected. apple is apple. period. lots of scratches on the film .   said it was brandnew but you can tell its been handle .  the package seems old .  not convince it is brandnew .  not worth the money .   excellent condition. 100% great seller. no problems what so ever and im very pleased. it's a good phone as usual. now the only way to get hold of an iphone 6 plus with 128gb. the phone works great, was as advertised and i love this iphone, very good job of describing product and the extras were appreciated as well, great job .   nice phone work very good. it's a beautiful iphone 6 plus. i love it.the seller reliable and trustworthy, item dileverd on time .   just what i expected .   transit quickly and the phone is great .   very happy with this purchase .   this phone is a gift for my friend who seems to like it very much .   the recall piss me off, i had the problem most of the time when i need to use it, i hate apple brand, will never ever buy it any more. very good , thanks  .   phone arrived on time as expected. however, there was a problem with the sim card reader causing the sim card to either not be recognized or the phone having no signal. we took it to the apple store and got it replaced .   have written my views on this product before. the sellers did not describe the item fully and cut some corners = they also delayed and did not want to tale the item back, after the discrepancies came to light by referring it to the apple store in west los angeles .   bought one and happy with it. thanks .   good. excellent phone, as expected. worked with fido in canada with no issue .   great phone just make room for it! now when i see the regular size phones they feel very small. i love my new screen .   great because it's unlocked and no one can hold you hostage with a early termination fee! battery life much, much better than the 5's. it 's a excellent product. very good and it works with chinese sim card very well. my wife love the phone .  is is great .   excelent, has expected, works very good .   does not work with verizon. very good phone. well, so far so good. only activated it a few days ago. one problem, the wall plug-in adaptor to charge the phone didn't work. thankfully i still have my old one. that was disappointing .   all good, as i would expect for 800 bucks .   the phone is great got it for a friend in the dominican republic. item was listed as unlocked and when i received it, the phone wouldn't work with my carrier. i called att and the phone is listed on the national stolen list. this phone cannot be used period .   excellent quality. ok. apple and gmail don't play well together. i had to download the gmail app in order to get email notification sounds, since the iphone's mail app won't do it. facebook notification sounds are inconsistent. there are some really nice thing about this phone though. i love the vibrancy of the display. i like text dictation. i do like the extra large format, though there is wasted space. the screen should really go to the edges .   excellent item! bought the iphone 6plus for my wife! she is extremely happy! the item was purchased by seller - us oem - item arrived on time and i'm sure it would have even been early then originally expected if it wasn't july 4th weekend. highly recommend purchase! â˜º. exactly what i wanted .   a++++. it came in on time and no issue at all. not as described. works as was expected. big enough i can actually see it. i use it for a lot of the things that before i only done on my computer .   love it, best phone ever .   sorry i was not able to use the phone had to return it because it was not a verizon phone as indicated .   awesome. after just one day of use, they touch screen stopped working. i brought it to the apple store and they were unable to repair it. instead they replaced it (lucky for me). not sure i would by a "like new" phone from this retailer again .   it arrived early; however, seems to work better with a headset .   the iphone 6 plus is a huge phone! it can be bully to carry, or even just using it in your hand. but there are many features to out weigh this. coming from the iphone 5s i still see a major increase in cpu and graphics power. another amazing feature about this phone is the camera. although it is only 8 megapixels it still can take better pictures than most of it's android competitors. the larger pixels allow for more light to enter the sensor and optical image stabilization blows my 5s out of the water. the battery life on this phone is amazing. i can go all day on heavy use with lots of apps, web, and texting and still end the day with 40% battery. doing that on my 5s was impossible. i would usually have to charge in the early afternoon on days like that. my favorite part about this though is the ecosystem around it. if you don't know what i'm talking about there are plenty places to read about it. but there is a beauty in the continuity. since buying this i don't feel that i need to use my ipad as much. there are some apps that don't work on the phone so i have to use the ipad but probably atleast 75% of my web browsing and amazon shopping is done on this device. in fact i'm writing this review on here right now .   perfect. like new and functioning perfectly .   the person i ordered this 4 loves it .   works great the only issue i had was no sim card so i had to take the phone to verizon and they gave me one for free so i could activate it. i expected this phone to be easier to use than the iphone 4 and 4s i had. also, keeps telling me i'm out of storage space and wants me to "buy" more. i don't think that is going to happen. deleting many unwanted things .   the phone doesnt work it got stuck after a week. great device .   excelente. excellent. 16gb is not enough, you find out after about 1 month, and then you cant return or exchange it .   so mad. love love love it! came 4 days ahead of schedule.no problem so far. was unlocked as advertised, very little scratchs so close to new.very very pleased!â¤ï¸. dun ask me why! just love it .   great price and great speed. very good. gooooooood .   its so good .   sasdfygykygvcjytjytfytyctjtfhayjf! no ? ok bye .   great phone, i got my iphone in 3 days like new. i really recommend this sheller. i sold sell to people brought us help raise

iphone. excelente. great :). excellent phone. not the iphone 6 plus, it is great, but, do not buy anything from julimya .   they are a bunch of rip off .   it is good to use on middle east countries,it works just fine .   phone is great does more than i expected .   excellent. all good .   great phone .   love this phone. all was perfect. great phone, switched from regular 6 to 6 plus and love it. i have fairly large hands but definitely need two hands in most cases to use this phone .   it's very good .   no comment. this is factory unlock can use any gsm/ sim card. excellent .   definitely it's working in venezuela and perfect! the box come sealed and the iphone 6 working very good ! thanks a lot .   love it .   love it .   i love this phone i have nothing to complain about.

everything worked perfectly .   excellent product. thanks  .   fast delivery  .   awesome product. i like it thanks , my phone work very well in venezuela. i love my iphone 6 plus it took some time getting here which was very aggravating .   but over all it's a very good phone .   hi. anyone can tellme if this model have lte .   fast delivery. good response. phone is flawless. using in india. no issues so far .   nice phone .   highly recommended this phone, i loved .   just got my phone and it already running hot, i haven't over charge it or nothing! other than that it's ok. reiceved my phone packaged safely and securely as expected and i love love love it wonderful phone to have. very pleased with the phone, however the sim card removal tool was missing. thank you. good. awesom. this phone really works well in all respects. however, it cannot get a 5 star because its advertising is mis-leading. it is supposed to be a 16 gb phone but a lot of memory is used for the operating system. that is really deceptive. if i was doing it againg i would definitely get the 64 gb model .   very bad phone, not brand new .   it's a damn iphone no review needed. it's great .   the best smartphone ever .   excellent seller all as agreed upon , and correpondia the product description , i recommend. fast shipping ,very good iphone. just what i expected. nice phone everything i was looking for  .   the first 2 days were dificult to get use ir burro after thad it became asoweme. fast shipping! highly recommended. great. perfect. finally the comfort and reliability of an iphone in the size that i always wanted! it's about time apple puts this phone out! i love it; touch id can be a little spotty but you just have to mind how you hold your fingers. if you like a big phone but your a snobby apple user like myself then you will be quite pleased .   excellent product. great phone, very fast, huge screen, amazing battery life! i can go 80 hours listening to mp3s or 14 hours watching videos! coming from a samsung/android fanboy  .   android can't touch this phone in battery life .   i love it .   so great  .   thanks a lot. awesome phone with extended battery life. iphone rocks .   i gave the phone as a gift to a friend who lives in dubai in the phone does not work. i'm disappointed because that was a christmas gift .   good. the phone is great, easy to work with and comfortable in my hand .   perfect! exactly what i wanted .   no problems with shipping .  extremely satisfied. love it! thank you so much. receive empty box. a+++ seller. quick shipping and very responsive to all questions. phone works great. great i love it. i really like my iphone 6 plus. it is awesome. i also would like to mention that amazon made a mistake not mentioned that it would take them 2 business days for verification process after i bought my iphone 6 plus. however, i called the amazon customer services people. at the begging they were trying to shift the responsibility somewhere else, but after i talked to one of the top managers who was very helpful and agreed that amazon should make it clear that whenever you buy something that cost more than $700 or $1000 or whatever amount, they will have to do the verification process which will take up to 2 business days. anyway, that top manager at amazon made it very easy for me. he got me an express mail that solved the whole problem, but i was on the phone for about an hour to reach that powerful manager. the company was excellent. that is just advice and sharing experience for whom are willing to buy it through amazon .   i have spent an entire day and will spend much of tomorrow trying to solve this problem. seller says this is a verizon phone, but both verizon and apple say it is in fact t-mobile. verizon shows no record of this handset and referred me directly to apple. apple had a hard time figuring out how the seller got a hold of this particular model (some unusual features) and advised they are unsure if adding an verizon sim card will work. anyone who has ever had to go to the verizon store knows that takes as long as buying a new car. not happy .   good. a little skeptical of buying pre-used phones especially iphones but this one works fine looks good and does what i expected. the phone was in perfect condition and works great .   so happy with it. love it. phone was broken. took it to the apple store and they said it would cost more to fix then then the phone cost. the apple store helped me put in the return from the store. on a positive it was very easy to return but i did have to pay for the shipping .   i wouldn't recommend purchasing a used iphone -- this phone had the grey bar/screen problem (google it) and was useless less than 6 months after i purchased. the apple warranty was expired and i literally lost $400 on a worthless phone. buyer beware .   5 stars for price and functionality, except sound volume/quality. aesthetically perfect. decent price. i love this phone however the volume is less than my 4s which had awesome clarity. i don't know if this is an inherent issue with the phone or if it's a quirk in the ios. i hope to find a solution soon .   great device in perfect condition. i have had the iphone for about 2 months now. it's in perfect condition haven't had any problems yet it's working perfectly fine.thank you guys i will be ordering another one soon ðÿ‘ðÿ». the phone got here and i'm using it as my daily driver now. it works great and i really like it. i would suggest getting 32 gb though .   phone works fine, but i am a bit worried about the screen death problem (which i heard about after i had ordered the phone). the screen is nice and large, but that causes increased phone size. this thing is big and pretty heavy. does not fit well in any of my pockets. i did not know what i was buying, so cannot fault the phone for that. check things out well before buying .   if i had known better i would not have bought this, very poor customer service and also defective phone. would not advise to buy .   way better and bigger than my old phone. plus a lot more fancy too. like all the new features on the 6 plus also love my new lifeproof case i bought too. great product, buyer was spot on with quality. no problems so far .   it has problems with it! it wont connect to wifi, location doesnt work, and it glitches from time to time .   requires at&t sim card but great phone great condition .   less functions than iphone 5s. did not work correctly. out of 20 times that we tried to swipe to unlock the screen, it only unlocked maybe 2 times. however, we contacted seller and were able to return it .   clearly a step up from my i-4 .   the phone statics a lot whenever i record something . & wont charge properly. it only uses the cable it came with it. if that ever breaks, i won't be able to use it .   i had for just over 2months. screen began to slowly fail then after getting an estimate of $200. to replace they found it was the motherboard. no way i'd ever buy again. the few extra bucks saved turned into $800. for a new phone with warranty, as the company never returned my husbands emails to even see what the issue was! huge waste of too much money .   more than a few scratches; and the screen was obviously changed. used a 3rd part screen, not from apple. the screen has a different color at an angle and it recently messed up .   phone works great and got here fast. what else could you ask for .   arrived really dirty but i cleaned it up .   for the size. awesome. ðÿ‘ðÿ». was a hardcore android fanboy and after a few months of using this i've realized that it's not at all what i thought. the build quality and snappy processor are great and everything has a very buttery smooth transition to it. battery life on the plus is amazing and as a extremely heavy user i can say you'll have a tough time killing this battery unless you play intense 3d rendering games for hours on end (very unlikely). sellers description was exact almost off and not giving it enough credit. it was noted as "used-acceptable" without a scratch on it, and believe me i looked! camera is a downside from my lg g4 and i miss functions like photo sphere from google. finger print scanner is a plus. and the one thing i hate the most for this is the lack of freedom that you get from android. can't even get ringtones from zedge without having to pay $1.30 for something i might not want after a few weeks. other than that the phone is awesome .   i searched all over amazon for the best deal on a refurbished iphone 6 plus and after finding this seller having a good $50 bellow all the other products i should have known there was going to be some kind of defect. about 2 weeks after receiving the product and using it, the phone began to not register my screen touches. at first i thought it was some kind of phone over heating problem because it had been outside laying on a table on a hot day for about an hour. that very same day the phone's touchscreen still would't register my touches and along with that some weird glitch would appear on the top half of the screen and slowly reach lower and lower into the phone disorienting the display. i took it to a phone repair store and they said that it was most likely the result of a really bad from home, do it yourself, screen replacement. so now it would cost me even more money to get this one fixed .   would recommend to everyone this phone is awesome .   great. my son's college replacement. shipping was fast as promised. little sent bottom corner (didn't remember seeing that in write up) but everything is working and not an issue as he uses a case. thank you. what the hell kind of service is this .   no at&t sim card included. not happy at all with how this product was represented .   not new .   good condition .   the product crapped out within 4 months, i got it and within the first week it would twitch and freak out. went somewhere to fix it and they said it was the mother board and they could do nothing. do not trust this company. it hasn't been working within the last 30 days. i'm a college student depends on her phone and think it's right to sell a product they know isn't working properly .   i like this product. shipping was fast. i love it. the phone was very clean as advertised. no problems .   a+++++ it was like new as described, delivered on time highly recommended. literally got a box without an iphone in it .   *you are risking your money buying a refurbished device* the device was fine at first .   for the first 2-3 weeks, then all of a sudden these spastic screen clicks started. my phone was impossible to use. it would randomly type things, open apps, crash pages i was using and freeze uncontrollably. after doing some frustrated research i found out that this was called "ghost touching". this is a problem with the device itself, no matter how many times you restore, update or restart it. the seller knew exactly what they were selling .   their "we guarantee our products to be as described or better." is a complete lie. they have a generic write in about how great their perfect devices are using elaborate / keywords to grab peoples attention into buying their devices. my supposed "perfectly working device" was a total scam. they'll over use keywords to try and sell you the "best device". they don't care about what they sell, and they certainly don't look into all the aspects of the device before putting them on their online store. i am very disappointed because after calling apple numerous times they said there is nothing they can do, and that i had to take it up with amazon and the hubbaz seller. *******buy at your own risk*******. love my new phone. great phone but the camera in the rear view is blurry and cannot focus. the post of my package was very delayed, and the quality of the phone is not good, about 3 months later, the screen always freezed and cannot work. but, when i contacted the seller, his response was quick and finally let me replaced a new one. anyway, my feeling is much better now.add two stars .   charger didn't work and phone cuts on and off and phone never stays charge. looks good. in anything under sold the great condition of this phone very happy with my purchase . thank you. good. i've just received my iphone 6 plus today and i was really excited however the charger isn't working, it says its charging but the percentage of the battery isn't increasing :/. it was delivered early  .   looks & feel brand new  .   love my phone, i recommend buying from this seller. its like a brand new device .   i love it .   thanks for the purchase. it's a gift for my daughter's coming birthday. good. it's iphone! so not much to say since it's always the same thing over and over. however, design like it's very attractive. if i could get rid of it i will and return to my 5s. update 27.9.2016: so i finally got rid of this phone, the size wasn't working for me. it is just too big and feels un-natural for an iphoneâ€‹, i'll pass. i went with the 6s instead. love it what can i say great deal. perfect condition absolutely love it .   great products amazon. it came in a very good condition just as stated. would purchase again anytime .   the iphone arrived super fast! it was just as promised, like new, taken care of with zero

great condition and i have had it for a couple weeks now with absolutely no problems .   like what he says.very good  .   great phone, it exceeded my expectations. this phone looks and operated like a brand new phone at half the price .   it's a great phone and looks great but very upset that something is wrong with the speaker when i talk or call someone it's even worse when i use facetime bummer i spent so much for a phone that i can't hear out of .   phone works good but the charger you sent does not work. this is an issue for me, as i purchased one of the more expensive phones available for the purpose that it came with the charger & head phones .   love my new phone great buy, great seller very fast delivery .   it's perfect i am happy with it. phone was not unlocked however i was able to have it unlocked per request send to at&t. love the phone, excellent cognition .   great phone! 128gb was too much, 16gb was too little, 64gb was just right .   iphone 6plus 16gb arrived way ahead

all cell phones need more updates. my family and grand kids have just spent a week at disney world and the photos that i captured for 6 days are excellent photos. apple by far has really come up with a winner .   the best phone ever. they all under contract. love it. love the + size! glad we did not get the smaller .   great phone ! thank you .   ok. this awesome product exceeded my expectations.

the box and didn't come with the manual that all new apple phone come with. after some research on refurbished and used phones it was more than evident that the phone wasn't "new" at all!the sim tray didn't have the serial # imprinted on it, the original serial # stickers were missing from the box and the serial # showed inaccurate date of manufacturer in conjunction with phone model! absolutely

dinged up and the microphone barely works. can't really communicate with siri because of that .   doesn't work so well in china the wifi aways disconnect it's ok. this was fraud on my account. even better than it looked online. this phone is exactly what i wanted. thanks for not screwing me out of my money .   perfect for me .   love my phone. so much yet to learn, but it does everything so quick and easy. looking forward to learning more .   loved it .   when i get it ,the charger is not working .   already cracked. i recieved headphones and a charger but no phone. i absolutely love my phone .   thank you matt .   worked great at first- now my phone is starting to glitch .   if you're thinking of buying a phone from this man please don't hesitate. he's definitely honest and communication was great .   i love the phone. thank god ðÿ˜šðÿ˜š. good. nice phone i really like it and it's much way cheaper than in apple store thank you. good enough. best of the best . i love it. great price .thanks a lot. love my 6s plus .   i am just wondering where is my warranty for it .   nice. company went belly up. or tried to take my money and run .   the phone wasn't in the box. i am extremely satisfied with this purchase. quick delivery and the phone is just like brand new with original receipt and apple warranty until end of june, 2016. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. phone got here fast but it has scratches in all for corners , top volume button is jammed and also the phone freezes i can't even get inside of it , i'm getting a refund. a+. i am enjoying the ease of this phone and the workshops and games. it takes great pictures .   very nice. item was delivered late, packaged in a brown box (poorly, because the air nylon bags were out of air and the phone box was moving all over inside of the brown box). the phone looks good tho and it's box looks untouched as well. however, this phone will not be activated right away cause it is a gift. so, it will take me a while to discover if it is truly unlocked or not. we tried to set it up but it is requesting a sim card which we currently don't have. we are going to wait on it, then i will update my review after the end results .   the iphone 6 plus came as a perfect match. not good. good product. good. uhm, a little larger than i expected, but very nice. i upgraded my phone and my children's phones from iphone 4s es so these were a huge change. the screens are so nice, so much larger and these are much faster. a lot better for games and surfing the web .   very apreeciated. brought the phone from them but the screen didn't work and it didn't say it in the description do not buy from them. i'n very happy with the it. phone is awesome really good deal too .   great phone, great shipping. dope ðÿ‘. it supposed to be unlocked phone, but i coulden't unlock it even with the seller instructions .   now good. it is 128gb if i had problems with my screen no longer serve, i had to change into a money making up apple store .   i was hoping chargers are included and headphones. good value and as presented. seems to be working fine. did require a simm card and that was fine. worked with my verizon carrier .   very fast shipping and i received the way it was described. very pleased with my iphone thanx. item was in near perfect condition. everything worked. delivered on time. exactally what it said it was .   very satisfied with the item. works just as expected. phone is great, 128gb of storage. i would recommend seller quicknship. fast delivery very clean phone. one small scratch that does not effect view .   good choice. good. excellent product timely delivery highly recommended. every thing was good  .   phone was in excellent condition as advertised .   works great .   absolutely perfect used phone, not a scratch and works as a new one. i like my new iphone 6 plus .   i got this for my mom for christmas. i have not had a large phone for quite some time for myself but now i want one :) no scratches but was not in a oem box. charger cable and headphones were included .   great. was a little nervous buying a refurbed phone, but it's been working absolutely perfectly. was in near perfect condition when we received it. activated easier than phones we've purchased directly from verizon. love the size coupled with the lightweight of the 6 plus! highly recommend .   i love my phone took awhile to come but it's amazing next one i'm getting is the 6s plus. very good. good. good. looks and works very good. has a small scratch on the screen, but i guess that is why priced $50 lower than others. --does not bother me as long as i saved $ .   love it .   the phone arrived in perfect condition .   seller provided product just like advertised and has a really good cs. i thought i would find the size cumbersome, but now i can't imagine going back to a smaller screen. great for tv/video on the go! battery life is decent considering the size .   love it. perfect. imei locked. me llegom defectuoso. my iphone 6 plus is awesome i am so glad i went with on amazon to purchase my phone very satisfied. phone as good as brand new. nice phone. yes love it so i need some i phone 6 &6 plus unlock please thanks ðÿ˜š. so far, so good. the phone meets the requirements of my cell phone service provider .   great item i love it :). received phone and tried to power on nothing happened. plugged into charger nothing happened. i thought these phones were tested before shipping especially refurbished phones .   i really loved. true to this sellers word, the iphone 6 plus is excellent .   upset .   the headphones were counterfeit and i'm starting to worry if the phone is too .   highly dissapointed! i spend 500+ dollars on this .   terrific product. provider set it up without an issue. the phone was not unloacked. this phone has dead pixels in it. prior to buying this i read about it and no where did it state it had a hardware issue. i am very disappointed as i spent close to 500$ .   as described. shipping was super fast and very well packaged priced that cant be beat  .   apple 6 plus a nice up grade and very fast. it is in good condition and it's worth its cost. great condition! works great. not what i wanted; great product, came on time. everything ok. good. my looks new like never been used. but it was used. no scratches no dents no cracks no nothing just a grate phone. if i there's an option for no star rating, i will do it for this lousy phone for couples of reasons. it's a brand-new factory unlocked phone that i purchase less than 2 weeks ago. it works as supposed for the first few days but shows signs of un-stability in the second week. sometimes i have to press the home button twice to make it work. when i surf web on safari, the screen does not rotate anymore! i'm coordinating with the seller to get it return now. compared to a nokia 925 that i have been using for over a year, iphone 6 plus is suck .   ðÿ‘. apple is my family .   love it. great condition. yesss, i love it exactly wht i expected. apple is apple. period. lots of scratches on the film .   said it was brandnew but you can tell its been handle .  the package seems old .  not convince it is brandnew .  not worth the money .   excellent condition. 100% great seller. no problems what so ever and im very pleased. it's a good phone as usual. now the only way to get hold of an iphone 6 plus with 128gb. the phone works great, was as advertised and i love this iphone, very good job of describing product and the extras were appreciated as well, great job .   nice phone work very good. it's a beautiful iphone 6 plus. i love it.the seller reliable and trustworthy, item dileverd on time .   just what i expected .   transit quickly and the phone is great .   very happy with this purchase .   this phone is a gift for my friend who seems to like it very much .   the recall piss me off, i had the problem most of the time when i need to use it, i hate apple brand, will never ever buy it any more. very good , thanks  .   phone arrived on time as expected. however, there was a problem with the sim card reader causing the sim card to either not be recognized or the phone having no signal. we took it to the apple store and got it replaced .   have written my views on this product before. the sellers did not describe the item fully and cut some corners = they also delayed and did not want to tale the item back, after the discrepancies came to light by referring it to the apple store in west los angeles .   bought one and happy with it. thanks .   good. excellent phone, as expected. worked with fido in canada with no issue .   great phone just make room for it! now when i see the regular size phones they feel very small. i love my new screen .   great because it's unlocked and no one can hold you hostage with a early termination fee! battery life much, much better than the 5's. it 's a excellent product. very good and it works with chinese sim card very well. my wife love the phone .  is is great .   excelent, has expected, works very good .   does not work with verizon. very good phone. well, so far so good. only activated it a few days ago. one problem, the wall plug-in adaptor to charge the phone didn't work. thankfully i still have my old one. that was disappointing .   all good, as i would expect for 800 bucks .   the phone is great got it for a friend in the dominican republic. item was listed as unlocked and when i received it, the phone wouldn't work with my carrier. i called att and the phone is listed on the national stolen list. this phone cannot be used period .   excellent quality. ok. apple and gmail don't play well together. i had to download the gmail app in order to get email notification sounds, since the iphone's mail app won't do it. facebook notification sounds are inconsistent. there are some really nice thing about this phone though. i love the vibrancy of the display. i like text dictation. i do like the extra large format, though there is wasted space. the screen should really go to the edges .   excellent item! bought the iphone 6plus for my wife! she is extremely happy! the item was purchased by seller - us oem - item arrived on time and i'm sure it would have even been early then originally expected if it wasn't july 4th weekend. highly recommend purchase! â˜º. exactly what i wanted .   a++++. it came in on time and no issue at all. not as described. works as was expected. big enough i can actually see it. i use it for a lot of the things that before i only done on my computer .   love it, best phone ever .   sorry i was not able to use the phone had to return it because it was not a verizon phone as indicated .   awesome. after just one day of use, they touch screen stopped working. i brought it to the apple store and they were unable to repair it. instead they replaced it (lucky for me). not sure i would by a "like new" phone from this retailer again .   it arrived early; however, seems to work better with a headset .   the iphone 6 plus is a huge phone! it can be bully to carry, or even just using it in your hand. but there are many features to out weigh this. coming from the iphone 5s i still see a major increase in cpu and graphics power. another amazing feature about this phone is the camera. although it is only 8 megapixels it still can take better pictures than most of it's android competitors. the larger pixels allow for more light to enter the sensor and optical image stabilization blows my 5s out of the water. the battery life on this phone is amazing. i can go all day on heavy use with lots of apps, web, and texting and still end the day with 40% battery. doing that on my 5s was impossible. i would usually have to charge in the early afternoon on days like that. my favorite part about this though is the ecosystem around it. if you don't know what i'm talking about there are plenty places to read about it. but there is a beauty in the continuity. since buying this i don't feel that i need to use my ipad as much. there are some apps that don't work on the phone so i have to use the ipad but probably atleast 75% of my web browsing and amazon shopping is done on this device. in fact i'm writing this review on here right now .   perfect. like new and functioning perfectly .   the person i ordered this 4 loves it .   works great the only issue i had was no sim card so i had to take the phone to verizon and they gave me one for free so i could activate it. i expected this phone to be easier to use than the iphone 4 and 4s i had. also, keeps telling me i'm out of storage space and wants me to "buy" more. i don't think that is going to happen. deleting many unwanted things .   the phone doesnt work it got stuck after a week. great device .   excelente. excellent. 16gb is not enough, you find out after about 1 month, and then you cant return or exchange it .   so mad. love love love it! came 4 days ahead of schedule.no problem so far. was unlocked as advertised, very little scratchs so close to new.very very pleased!â¤ï¸. dun ask me why! just love it .   great price and great speed. very good. gooooooood .   its so good .   sasdfygykygvcjytjytfytyctjtfhayjf! no ? ok bye .   great phone, i got my iphone in 3 days like new. i really recommend this sheller. i sold sell to people brought us help raise money for trailer and with truck soon we not have job. great product! exactly as advertised. excellent phone and excellent customer service from ragstorichs. bien exelente. great .   supper. goooood iphone. excelente. great :). excellent phone. not the iphone 6 plus, it is great, but, do not buy anything from julimya .   they are a bunch of rip off .   it is good to use on middle east countries,it works just fine .   phone is great does more than i expected .   excellent. all good .   great phone .   love this phone. all was perfect. great phone, switched from regular 6 to 6 plus and love it. i have fairly large hands but definitely need two hands in most cases to use this phone .   it's very good .   no comment. this is factory unlock can use any gsm/ sim card. excellent .   definitely it's working in venezuela and perfect! the box come sealed and the iphone 6 working very good ! thanks a lot .   love it .   love it .   i love this phone i have nothing to complain about. very good phone. very good phone. perfect! and fast delivery. very satisfied. much improvement over my iphone 4 .   i love it, it works with verizon and there were no scratches or dents on it and everything worked perfectly .   excellent product. thanks  .   fast delivery  .   awesome product. i like it thanks , my phone work very well in venezuela. i love my iphone 6 plus it took some time getting here which was very aggravating .   but over all it's a very good phone .   hi. anyone can tellme if this model have lte .   fast delivery. good response. phone is flawless. using in india. no issues so far .   nice phone .   highly recommended this phone, i loved .   just got my phone and it already running hot, i haven't over charge it or nothing! other than that it's ok. reiceved my phone packaged safely and securely as expected and i love love love it wonderful phone to have. very pleased with the phone, however the sim card removal tool was missing. thank you. good. awesom. this phone really works well in all respects. however, it cannot get a 5 star because its advertising is mis-leading. it is supposed to be a 16 gb phone but a lot of memory is used for the operating system. that is really deceptive. if i was doing it againg i would definitely get the 64 gb model .   very bad phone, not brand new .   it's a damn iphone no review needed. it's great .   the best smartphone ever .   excellent seller all as agreed upon , and correpondia the product description , i recommend. fast shipping ,very good iphone. just what i expected. nice phone everything i was looking for  .   the first 2 days were dificult to get use ir burro after thad it became asoweme. fast shipping! highly recommended. great. perfect. finally the comfort and reliability of an iphone in the size that i always wanted! it's about time apple puts this phone out! i love it; touch id can be a little spotty but you just have to mind how you hold your fingers. if you like a big phone but your a snobby apple user like myself then you will be quite pleased .   excellent product. great phone, very fast, huge screen, amazing battery life! i can go 80 hours listening to mp3s or 14 hours watching videos! coming from a samsung/android fanboy  .   android can't touch this phone in battery life .   i love it .   so great  .   thanks a lot. awesome phone with extended battery life. iphone rocks .   i gave the phone as a gift to a friend who lives in dubai in the phone does not work. i'm disappointed because that was a christmas gift .   good. the phone is great, easy to work with and comfortable in my hand .   perfect! exactly what i wanted .   no problems with shipping .  extremely satisfied. love it! thank you so much. receive empty box. a+++ seller. quick shipping and very responsive to all questions. phone works great. great i love it. i really like my iphone 6 plus. it is awesome. i also would like to mention that amazon made a mistake not mentioned that it would take them 2 business days for verification process after i bought my iphone 6 plus. however, i called the amazon customer services people. at the begging they were trying to shift the responsibility somewhere else, but after i talked to one of the top managers who was very helpful and agreed that amazon should make it clear that whenever you buy something that cost more than $700 or $1000 or whatever amount, they will have to do the verification process which will take up to 2 business days. anyway, that top manager at amazon made it very easy for me. he got me an express mail that solved the whole problem, but i was on the phone for about an hour to reach that powerful manager. the company was excellent. that is just advice and sharing experience for whom are willing to buy it through amazon .   i have spent an entire day and will spend much of tomorrow trying to solve this problem. seller says this is a verizon phone, but both verizon and apple say it is in fact t-mobile. verizon shows no record of this handset and referred me directly to apple. apple had a hard time figuring out how the seller got a hold of this particular model (some unusual features) and advised they are unsure if adding an verizon sim card will work. anyone who has ever had to go to the verizon store knows that takes as long as buying a new car. not happy .   ordered from seller prime electronics. highly recommend them. ordered refurb. just as good as new, but much cheaper. very happy with it .   my daughter loves this phone,thanks. perfect. great. everything ok and perfect. recomendable .   not entirely, the camera has scratches and ruins most pictures. everything else works but they should have mentioned that the camera not as great. the phone arrive in excellent condition--new and in its original packaging. the phone operates as a new phone should--without problems. got to me super fast! i absolutely love it .   and will be ordering again pretty soon .   very high quality product, fast shipping and competitive pricing. shipping delivery time beat the amazon estimated delivery window by several days, which is always nice! :) stephanie, owner at phone barn, is legit .   my iphone works perfectly and looks perfect also! would recommend this seller to anyone. very satisfied with product .   its ok. fast shipping and nice phone .   i love the iphone 6 plus, working well and offering more gb than my previous 16 one! love it! thanks, evelyne. i like the phone and it came in fast. the product came on time and in tact. it comes with earphones and charger and it works perfectly. i highly recommend this company and the iphone 6. the battery still needs a lot of charging, but i'm sure i can remedy that by turning down the brightness and such .   good phone, nice big screen, very sharp resolution. it was a great gift for my father. bought it refurbished. it failed after exactly 31 days (amazon accepts returns up to 30 days). thankfully the customer service is great and they still gave me a refund. tl;dr good product in general but do not buy refurbished from amazon,. works well. i got the 128 gig version and it has huge amounts of space for video and pictures. very easy to set up. battery life is good, screen is great - easy to read for an older pair of eyes like mine. watching video is much easier. i am very happy with the purchase .   perfect. phone is terrible, sometime it ring most time it doesn't. they rip me off .   excellent. all perfect .   i like. this is the best phone i have ver used. i can do everything with this phone. i really love it .   damaged product. what can i say? how can you go wrong with apple .   good. great phone! shipped in the time it should have. thank you. amazing phone. i'm so happy with this deal. thanks .

great deal. it was bad. the phone came with several defects. i needed return it .   at first i had issues because the phone sid not recognized my old sim card. however after i replaced the sim with a new one the phone worked flawlessly. very happy with the purchase. defective phone. works only for two days. phone is flickering and the screen doesn't responding. couldn't even open the slide to unlock key. i wish i could give 0 star. poor customer service. don't buy from this seller. just be mindful .   excellent .   looks new, works great .   its a great phone. the phone is alright. like it. excellent. its really good i have it right now. but the corners are cracked. good product .   great apple phone. i bought it as a replacement for my 5c 32gb. great battery lasts for 2 days. touch sensor very sensitive to wet fingers - can't recognize. big screen is amazing. cellular sensivity better than in 5c. great phone  .   great phone. , came on time and it was already used but you

iphone was perfect. false! i paid for the product that claimed to be an iphone 6 plus and it is just the iphone 6 .   very disappointed to spend that much money and not receive what i paid for .   the item exceeded my expectations .   it came earlier than stated and was in its original packaging. really love the look and feel of this phone. very pleased with the seller. i would not hesitate to buy from this seller again .   the phone is a bit slower than the regular phones. i don't know why. but satisfied for the price. i t have some dents on the top and bottom but i never read them on the description. i will give 4 out of 5 for this phone. iphone 6+  .   what do i need to say. it is an awesome device! just as advertised .   so excited about my new phone. i was cautious about purchasing a used phone over the internet sight unseen. i recieved exactly what i ordered and expected .   i must say i'm very happy with my phone thanks for everything guys at next .   i will definitely do business with y'all again. ðÿ’¯ðÿ’¯ðÿ’¯ðÿ’¯âœ”ï¸. great product .   i'm not sure it's a new phone because he comes with a sim card of verizon and the sim card was actived. arrived in mint condition. :-) great phone .   excellent. thanks all great. excelente. i received the phone with wrong color .  , kinda dissappointed. instead of space gray i got silver. and on the box it,says unlocked not

4.7 inches)always check.but i'm satisfied with this size.thanks. thanks so much. i love my iphone 6 plus. printed on new label, didn't have apple factory sealed on it. very nice phone, four star, because of the obvious problem of iphones, i can't send things to android phone via bluetooth, i can't password protect sms, whatsapp (this type of protection is crucial), i have to use the password or fingerprint to lock entire phone, this is not what most want. excelent. superb screen. this phone has substantial capacity. constantly get looks of envy. to quote don corelone "keep your enemies close, and your iphone 6+ closer!". the iphone arrived on time i am very happy with the unit. excellent. thanks. it was not a factory unlock phone but as per tech setting up the phone a t-mobile phone unlock. it arrived in a flash and works well. i love the larger size although i was reluctant at first. i can read books on it with ease so i don't have to carry my ipad with me when i'm waiting for appointments. the photos are superior .   phone arrived in great shape. best buy ever .   great phone .   item as described .   excellent choice. very bad. i am not such an apple fan but this phone grew on me so quickly that i have been trying to buy it for a while. i bought this for someone but i would love to get one for myself, that is how much i value this particular phone. nice and fast deal .  thanks .   very good, service excelent. receive a wrong item,. delivery was excellent .   the phone is working well. impressed by the camera. the 6 plus has replaced my ipad entirely .   perfect. great deal and my friend in europe loved the gift .   works perfect. arrived on time, no visible damages for refurbished product .   love my device. met expectations .   not sure if the unlocked feature was worth the money, but the phone itself rocks. received a sealed iphone 6 plus as advertised. i took the sim card out of my iphone 5 and stuck it into this phone and it was up and running. the unlocked phone does not come with any sim card. i have replaced my ipad and iphone 5 with this thing and am happy as can be. not complaints so far- you must have a case for this phone as it tends to be slippery .   it is a order for my friends. i hope he is like it .   very good. excellent. this is what i expected. good choice. delivered on time .   quick response to the mails with accuracy and the phone is working fine as of now. i would suggest to go for it :). excellent. the phone arrived on time as described. everything in its right place. the phone is amazing. quite addictive .   awesome phone! best one i ever had. phone was sold to me for about 200 dollars under market value. a price that could not be beaten. the phone was exactly as described, seller also did expedited shipping, for free .   i look forward to buying from him in the future .   so far so good.beautiful .   great phone. not a scratch on it, simple to set up. i'd buy from this seller again. quick shipping too .   my phone not working now apple say there is wire in side cut is manufacture wrong please can you help me to fix the phone. amazing products .   the iphone 6 plus is the best cellphone on the market, nothing to complain about it .   a-1 .   shipping was a month faster than estimated! came with two minor scratches on the screen. i can't even see them with the screen on so no big deal. came with a charging cord, wall charger and manual. so far so good! i love the huge screen .   as much as i expected it to be - works well for me .   perfect. good. i don't have complain. still working.but the phone size is to big .   i'm pleased with my iphone 6 plus (unlocked) which is up and running. it is wonderful to have a telephone which is aso a versatile tablet computer. i am a little nervous about its fragility and have bought one of the stronger cases on the market to protect it. the large size of the iphone 6plus seems to have an unexpected advantage -- it can pick up phone signals more easily in bad reception areas than small devices. some of the software interfaces less well with my macbook and ipads than i had expected -- contacts in particular, which worked seamlessly between mac and tablets -- don't work with iphone for reasons i cannot work out. instead i have my google address book and similar -- which i don't want-- in the iphone 6 contacts book. i am using this iphone ont he edge of europe, and (on the basis of what i had read on the net) was nervous about whether the 4g technology would work in a distinctly non-4g non-lte environment. but it does. hiccups have been getting sms messages to come in -- achieved with a bit of guidance from the net. but on a transcontinental flight, the 6plus was the perfect companion and inflight entertainment centre. if any thing the overall performance is better than i expected -- and at the price i paid for a 128gb model i expected a lot. i've got it .   great iphone. it is very good, and i like it .   awesome. great phone. it is hard to use with one hand unless you have very large hands. but using this makes me use my ipad mini less .   after one month using the cellphone my cellphone became whit some problems the battery is not working well . the firsts 2 weeks was perfect duration of the battery was all the day now it's 4 hours. approximately don't know why but i'm having this issue. love this phone. i just bought a month, home button failure can not be used, just take the apple store to be repaired. . . i'm so sad. great buy will buy from again. it gave my wife and she is super happy, it is a very good phone, it's like a computer, i mean you do not need laptop or ipad is very full, so we brought ecuador and works perfectly with a local operator. 100% serious vender very recomended. excellent phone in excellent use. the phone was great but not unlocked and still under contract according to the carrier. had to send it back. the best. i love iphones! this phone is a great piece of technology. i recommend getting it .   1 day delivery delayed but well worth. its kind of big when we talk about iphone the size is very big but the phone is ow some .   excellent i like. it works awesome .   nice phone and it really looks new as advertised .   thoroughly enjoyable buying experience and i could not be more pleased with my purchase .   owesome .   excelent .   the best. i love this phone. excellent .   the larger 6 w 64gigs is great. i have vision problems and everything is larger. phone was factory fresh .   5s gave me an iphone and not the iphone 64gb 6 plus to buy. the phone in general is fine, however i only have 114gb of space available to me. i am missing 14 gb .   very nice ðÿ˜„. i love it. a lot of great features all in one. i am enjoying my iphone .   brilliant - everything you can expect from apple .   excellent. good . thanks. excellent. i'm not really like. as expected, huge, ackward at fisrt but outstanding overall. cant go back .   excellent. received phone as listed .   ok. excellent phone, have't had any problem. love this phone so much .   wanderful. apple product its great what can i say. phone is simple but great to use for social media and enjoying music. every thing is perfect. the only issue is it is kind expensive .   really great phone. very nice phone. i upgraded from the iphone 4s. the larger size of the 6 plus is perfect for surfing the web etc. the phone is a natural fit in the palm of your hand and ios8 despite the little glitches (which are being fixed) is a real improvement. the new keyboard makes texting a breeze. love it .   used phone. probably a stolen phone from somebody. it has sim card in the phone when i get it. worst deal ever .   bought from apple express electronics and was satisfied with the promptness and courtesy of the seller. item arrived new and sealed, as advertised! came with a verizon sim but hey, i'm glad the iphone comes with cdma and gsm antennas, so activating with at&t was as easy as sticking in the respective sin and going through the usual activation process. the iphone 6 plus itself is huge, but everyone knows that by now. i do look at it in comparison with other phablets and think that apple should rethink the top part to make the phone slightly shorter (maybe placing the front camera, the sensor and speaker all in a raw) or maybe rethinking the internal arrangement of parts. other than size it is a very nice and slick looking device. yes, some may say, base on the front panel, that it is just an iphone but blown up. although true, it is slim enough and the back (although probably inspired by the htc m8) makes it look like a very premium phone. i personally miss the glass back of the iphone 4 and 4s but can probably understand that said choice is more prone to cracked phones. i will not go into details on the performance of the phone. you can visit youtube and just search for the details on that. however, i can say that it provides a very smooth experience going from one page to another, opening and exiting apps and accessing the control center and notification menu. this has to be taking into consideration as it is not as spec heavily as say the galaxy note 4 or the xperia z3 or many other android phones that have very impressing internals. yet the iphone works with what it has and works really good. the camera is still 8mp but the photos and videos are gorgeous. maybe his is one of few reasons why apple prides itself on quality and justifies its price tag.  .  but i think the phone should be at least $50 cheaper for all models! ios is simple and works well i a big phone. i wished it had home screen widgets and more customization options other folders but ios isn't a broke os. it works fine all around. i like finally being able to rotate my phone on the home screen (although a minor detail to some, it is more than welcomed and i think should be on all ios devices). the bigger screen makes it easier for me to tipe and enjoy stuff in safari or other apps that are customized forbthebiphone 6 pkus. the battery? i am charging my phone every 2 days with moderate use; day and a-half with heavy use. it's a good, solid phone! recommend if you like simplicity and reliability, although warranted with a higher price tag .   great phone, it has a great and high resolution screen. the camera has an excellent performance .   i love it  .   amazing phone ever by apple .   the iphone 6 plus arrived on-time and in perfect condition as stated. it was just like purchasing directly from apple which is what any purchaser would want for such a pricey item. very pleased with the seller and would purchase again from this seller .   present for wife last christmas. she is not techy at all and her last phone was a feature phone. she complained at first at how big and complicated it seemed, but she uses it now nonstop and things she used to use my old ipad to do is all done on her phone. it's been almost a year and the battery still lasts long and as it's a google phone still gets updates! really impressed and may move myself from the samsung to this if a newer model is available cheap .   still getting used to how big it is .  definitely going with a smaller phone next time around. the camera is awesome, over all a great phone. just big .   best phone i,ve ever owned battery life is not so great because of huge screen though. it is a great phone for my research works. i bought this phone in an emergency situation (accidentally broke my note 3 and was in desperate need of a new phone of similar size), so i wasn't in a position to take all of its features and setbacks into account. at first, i was satisfied with it--it did all the functions that i needed it to do plus some. however, the more i used it over time, the more i began to see its flaws and the more flaws it started to develop. it doesn't seem to be too happy when a handful of apps are being used simultaneously as many of my apps (especially snapchat and facebook) crash constantly. sometimes the whole phone just crashes and restarts for whatever reason. there are times when it overheats to the point where i have to stick it in my freezer for 5 minutes to let it cool down. also, the camera quality is garbage. the phone does what i need for it to do, but being the impatient person that i am, i easily get frustrated over its inability to cope with higher-than-average usage. with that, i'm pretty certain i won't be buying a nexus after i'm done with this one. i'm trying to eke it out for two years to make it somewhat worth the purchase, and its two years are almost up (thank goodness) .   google slowly wants to forget about the nexus 6. when it was new it was the best android phone on the market. even when the 6p was out, nexus 6 was still among the best .   extremely happy with this phone! thank you! it arrived in perfect and brand new condition .   good job. edge cellular $217â motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 32gb, midnight blue (u.s. warranty) (discontinued by manufacturer) integrity - not seller stated â€œvery good condition â€“ refurbished phoneâ€ the speaker/ringer is completely blown and sounds so muffed it gives me a headache. how this could pass inspection by an authorized company is beyond me. the sad thing is - i found out after i spent hours setting up and transferring everything from my old smartphone including getting a new sim card. very upset plan on returning. i recently purchased this cell after breaking my note4. i am very impressed by the stock android experience. very easy to setup with verizon and instantly updated to 7.0 android n. only con is the battery life. if you are like me a heavy cell user you can expect 5 hours of use before a quick charge .   great~love it. best phone i have ever owned. feels like a flagship phone for half the cost .   impressive phone for the price. has some features even the current model year doesn't have 2 years later. love the huge screen .   only 25gb. working good. gave as a gift- reported great .   proximity sensor stopped working within a few weeks so the phone would go blank and stay blank when making calls. there was no way out of it. i bought the nexus 5x and i am very happy .   i ordered the midnight blue, got black. it said it works on all networks, which it seems to, but it doesn't automatically choose the correct network or automatically put all the information in for the apn, etc. took a while to figure that out and then manually enter everything, and i would have liked the color i ordered, but as of last night it's working. will see how it does over the coming days to say if i like all the features or not .   the problem with this phone is it's very slippery. buy the case. i've had the phone for less than two months and it no longer works; dropped it too many times to count. more than all of the other phones,tablets i've owned combined. this was my 3rd nexus now i'm wary of the brand .   probably my most favorite phone of all time -- but remember, it's friggin' huge. i scored this phone on black friday for $200 -- it was like winning the lottery. the gps and video watching on this beast is unmatched. the camera could be faster but i've seen improvements with every android update. i'd say the camera is just as good as my wife's iphone 6. her camera is a bit faster but we've taken photos of the same thing and the photos are very comparable -- though her camera is much faster. there was no bloat ware and 3 gb of ram! this phone performs! everyone asks me what phone it is -- because i'm always using it. the battery is just ok. i keep this guy plugged in while driving or it just won't last. the fast charger that it comes with works real well to keep me going through out the day. i wish it had a sd card slot -- probably the worst part of the phone. but i simply drag photos off the phone by plugging into any pc and i can still access photos with my gmail account no problem. i can load movies and watch with vlc player and it's no problem. ordered by mistake. better options available .   new phone, discontinued at half the going price when it was new. unlocked so you can dump your carrier if they get too expensive or in my case had poor coverage where i needed the phone to function 100%. left vm and bought this phone and now use at&t .   the speed of opening websites, opening and playing games like asphalt 8 airborne, downloading (apps, songs, and videos is awesome. the dual led flashlights creates envy. soccer this phone is old, accessories for it are pretty cheap. but this phone is terribly hard to see on a sunny day outside. this phone's speed surprised the t-mobile sales rep! i used there slowest wi-fi and he still was amazed! oh, i did not see any cosmetic damage on screen nor body .   very pleased with this phone. glad it has wireless charging. works well on android 7.0. don't buy this phone. phone's screen was broken easy.i just dropped from the desk once and the screen was totally crashed and system was going dead. warranty never cover broken screen. i called the moto customer service for repair, their screen repair fee is $175+ tax. i just got this phone about $250 within one year .   hello .   i bought nexus6 phone. but, this phone is not unlocked! phone model is xt1103 (model 00630nartl) phone is not detected sim card. phone is locked level2 .   i want know that unlock method and unlock serial number. please send me mail (unlock method &serial number) : sstar75@navet.com thanks. hate this phone. had so many problems since purchase. would never buy products from motorola ever again. i sent my phone back for replacement/repair 4 times every time have to wait for a month or so to get it back(i hope you have a spare one) and then new one would glitch or stop working within the month. absolutely terrible experience .   unreal how great this phone is, still to this day, and how cheap it is. and i don't even use project fi. i'm not even tempted to get the pixel. coupled with how great this phone is and how unimpressed i am with the pixel. why would they directly compete with apple and samsung? i'm hoping they surprise us all by continuing some form of another nexus line. things i love -ui is butter. -front facing speakers -huge screen which uses all the space possible. -turbo charge with surprisingly adequate battery life. -the slight cylindrical bend in back makes it much more rugged and does well for the phone. mminor critiques noticed that it can get hot pretty fast, but hasn't had any hindrance for my use over the year i've had it. selfie camera aint all that great, but gets the job done. main camera is top notch for videos. for still shots with no motion it's amazing. but gotta make sure you tap where you want it to focus. foreign phone users struggle to take good pictures with it. slightly frustrating, but i've gotten some incredible photos from this camera .   it's xt1103, i thought it's xt1100ã€‚. love its function and appearance. it is really nice .   this phone ended up rebooting at random including in a middle of the call. i have tried all the tricks i could find on various nexus 6 forums to improve stability, all in vain. sad, i had better opinion of both google and motorola (actual manufacturer) quality after owning nexus 5 (made by lg, great manufacturer) for many years .   speakers made a buzzing noise first day of use. had to return it. props to amazon warehouse for making returns easy and simple .   love it .   been using it since january,2016, this phone is very easy to use, always gets the newest updates the quickest. it feels big at first but after few month when you get use to it, it makes any smaller screen difficult to look at .   came absolutely new! i was expecting less and got more! that's why i love amazon prime! the unit came in its original box, with everything still in its original unopened packagings. as far as i can tell the unit had never been used. the nexus's box was opened with a small crush on one corner but other than that it was "brand new" in its original packaging. works great as all nexus devices do and amazon as always comes through. this unit came from amazon's warehouse. always great products! jimr. really good .   i love it. good. amazing phone .   i've had iphones, droid turbo, htc's, lg's and this is the best by far. great big screen and fast processor. no bloatware came installed and it fired right up with verizon when i put my sim card in .   ok, i loved the phone, but the unit i got i am pretty sure was refurbished. it had some scratching just left of the usb port like that is where they had pried to lift the screen out. and the wireless charging did not work at all(another i had ordered worked fine). as far as the buying experience and shipping, and the return. amazon made this very easy. i love buying from amazon, such good customer service. i immediately bought this one and have had no problems.â motorola nexus 6 xt1103 32gb 3g/4g lte unlocked factory-sim free (midnight blue). excellent have used it for a while now came with a case. great, great, great. i am using that phone so far,it's awesome.runs fast and huge memory. awesome phone, decent price. got to alaska reasonably fast .   excelente y unlocked. good buy. still use the phone, and have a second one too boot. still an excellent phone in 2016 .   almost going on a year and i'm loving my nexus - dropped a billion times and still no cracks or damage to the phone itself thanks to the combo protection of: 1. nexus 6 case supcase and 2. nexus 6 screen protector,yootechâ® premium motorola google nexus 6 tempered glass screen protector (2.5d 9h hardness, superslim 0.26mm) the screen protector has done it's job and i figured it's time to replace it as, even thought it wears (pun yeah?) it's battle scars well, it's earned it's well-deserved rest. these things slightly annoy me about the phone: (but nothing i can't obviously live with) -i notice that the phone overheats for a few days after a software update is loaded -there's no way to get rid of the app button from the bottom tab -apps will take on a life of their own sometimes and will themselves open without any prompting but i stll wuv you nexus! :). for the price i purchased it ($200 on black friday 2015), the 32gb nexus 6 is by far the best value i've gotten in a smart phone. it just (oct 2016) received an ota update to android 7.0, which is more than can be said for most phones released around its time. as has been widely mentioned, the phone is massive, but it's not as unwieldy as some make it seem. after owning both the first and second generation moto x before this, i can say that the curved back design they all share is more annoying the larger the phone. whereas the 1st gen x felt incredible in the hand, this one is too large for the curve to provide much ergonomic benefit. when i place it on qi wireless charging plates, it seems to take some getting used to the right placement, and the device will slide off with the lightest of touches. that being said, the battery life is easily the best i've gotten in a smartphone. the turbo charger is excellent, and it's a feature i'll never do without going forward. the speakers aren't excellent by any means, but they are well ahead of the pack simply by being on the front of the phone and being stereo. the display is generally good, though i've noticed that part of the display seems a bit lighter than the rest when displaying uniform, mostly dark screens. only a mild annoyance, since there aren't many screens like that, and doesn't affect use. by far my biggest gripe/negative of the n6 is the camera(s). the front-facing camera is grainy and extremely poor in low-light. the rear camera can take some excellent shots in decent lighting, but it is soo slow. the image processing is slow (even w/ hdr off), the shutter lags horribly, even the viewfinder lags .   and it's only gotten worse as time has gone on. i don't know what the cause is, but i know that it will eventually be the reason i choose to move on from the n6 eventually. if it wasn't for the camera issues, i'd probably have this phone another year at least .   great product. purchased this for my dad and he absol. it was in super good condition .   best phone i ever had, had for a year now. awesome phone but it comes with a factory defect. the audio will go away after a while, i think is software related. because after the update it started fading away when playing music. no matter how high the volume is set, you will barely hear the music playing .   most impressed by this phone. this old phone ( nexus 6) still works like new even-though i bought it used in may. android upgrade to marshmallow came through like a breeze. waiting for the nougat upgrade to come soon. hey you know .  i'll get it .  because it's nexus. you can't beat that. the screen is clear and the battery life seems to get better with the upgrades to the system. nice job goggle .   my next brand new phone will be a goggle nexus 7 .   what can i say about this phone. it is user friendly, operating system is fast, the phone itself is big with a good size screen but light and after more than one year of using it it is still functioning good .   i love this phone. i used nexus 5 for 3 years and upgraded it to nexus 6 today .   this piece is awesome .   this is an excellent phone (at least if your a bigger dude with a bigger hand to hold this beast) 3gb of ram, 32gb of internal & quad core, its almost perfect, only thing i wish it hand was a microsd slot but oh well .   otherwise its an excellent device with a little tweaking with the nexus toolkit the skys the limit .   its so much better with a custom rom of purenexus & you can add what you wants its a smooth ride .   only need to charge it every few days .   i try to let it get down to 10-15% an then w/the turbo charger its back to 100% in an 30 mins .   its gets alittle warm so unplug it an let it cool a bit before i start putzing around  .   multirom is a must if you wanna test this puppy an see what it can all do :). probably one of the most underrated phones from the past couple years. the screen size is actually bigger than most of the other 6 inch phones, which was one of main things i was looking for. the ability to unlock the bootloader in order to flash factory images and roms is another big plus. this is true about all nexus phones, but the difference is that the nexus 6 is the biggest one available (yes, bigger than the 6p). i have been using this phone for about a year and have no complaints, and you can't do much better than the current price point. i am 6 ft tall and have no problem holding the phone with one hand. shorter people with small hands might have an issue with this. it's not as pretty as some of the other phones, which contributes to why it isn't as popular, but it wins where it counts .   cool. this is the 2nd phone that i bought via amazon and i have no complaints. works greats, gets updates, and looks like new. my time with the nexus 6 comes to a close. sort of. unfortunately due to the limited protection of tempered glass screen protectors for this device, my phone fell from a height of about 2 feet and landed directly on the smallest strip of glass on the screen: the bit above the top speaker, and the screen has broken in that small section, spidering out a single crack towards the device's edge. to limit further damage, i've opted to relegate the 6 to tablet status, and bought a 6p. it wasn't because of my issues with the device, i just would prefer to prevent any more unsightly cracks, particularly across the actual used screen surface. so future owners, be wary of this area. my device was in a case, with tempered glass, and i still ran into some bad luck and cracked the screen. if it was wasn't for this, the nexus 6 would be my daily phone. now onto a review of the actual use of device itself. the n6 runs smoothly, nearly as good as the day i first used it nearly a year ago. stock android is obviously a huge selling point for the nexus line, and it's the best android experience you can get. i've used devices with sense, touchwiz, etc, and nothing comes close to stock. the hardware is still more than capable, although it gets beaten by nearly every other flagship these days, but that's obviously to be expected. the screen is the best part about this beast. it's geared towards media usage, and it's the best experience thus far with a device of this type i've had. the speakers are the second best part, both are front facing and both have amazing sound. the volume levels are a bit wonky, as they are using headphones as well, but those are fairly small issues that shouldn't prevent any buyers from getting this if it's discounted even more. haven't used nougat previews yet, but it handles marshmallow fantastically. the nougat features would make this an even better experience when the issues are ironed out and the final version of the os rolls out. battery time is great when the screen isn't on, and i've had so-so results with my screen on time. it may be an issue with my device, but considering how massive it is and the fact that ambient display is the default notification option, you kind of expect "meh" results. this can be solved by (if you know what you're doing and have read all the warranty info.) rooting and installing greenify and light flow, where you can boost battery life a bit more with some tweaks. and since i'm on the subject of light flow, the fact that the notification light (yes, there is one and its hidden under the top speaker) is deactivated on the device is ridiculous. what gives? only motorola and possibly google know. you need root functionality to gain use of it, but why should you have to do that to use it? that's probably my biggest gripe with the n6. all in all, i'd still recommend this device as a daily device, and would have still been mine if not for some poor circumstances and luck. get if quick if you find it new and cheap. you won't regret it. edit: 10/10/16 flashed the n6 nougat factory image on the phone, and my gosh, does it work seamlessly. after the update, i love this phone even more .   this phone it was like new condition and the phone is super fast. i like it's pure android without bloatwared i would buy from the same seller again .   this is a good deal if you can get it for < $200 as of 9/2016. even the top budget phone right now moto g4 is worse than this and costs the same. other phones can cost 200, but these have the advantage of sprint compatibility, which means dirt cheap, great coverage service if you use mvnos like tello. i bought the diztronic ultra case for this because someone tested dropping the phone with it and it survived everything. it is fast and runs most games well but it does have a problem of touchscreen malfunctioning after playing for a long time and needs a restart to fix it. the sound has a relatively low output so you may need a headphone amp with it. the colors are great, used for 2 weeks and hasn't had glaring burn-ins yet. at first i was worried the huge size would be bad, but it actually doesn't feel bulky. i think it can be very wide but as long as it's thin it won't feel bulky. the battery life is so-so, as expected of an average size battery. but as always, you can get it last at least a whole day if you turn down the brightness. i don't experience the encryption lag that people mention, maybe because of android updates .   its only a little over a month since i bought this phone and so far i have had no problems. still my daily to this day .   love having a stock android device with a large screen! came with warranty too .   nothing more to say really. it's the pure android experience, and its performance is unparalleled. as a plus, the battery lasts forever and the battery saver mode can last a really long time .   great phone, the screen size and resolution is great. if you like phone with clean os without annoying pre installed apps and access to latest android updates this is the right phone for you. great battery life cons the wake up button is hard to press. huge fan of nexus products and the ability to unlock the bootloader, root, install custom os and recovery, etc. don't care about any of that? still a great phone. the 6 inch screen gives plenty of real estate to work with, and the default software is not bloated by carrier and manufacturer apps .   works as described. the nexus 6 is a few years old down the line but however does hold a candle compared to the latest flagships. what i do like about this handset, is the mighty display. the 6' inch screen is very large and when set next to my moto g 1st gen, the difference is distinctly obvious. the dual front facing stereo speakers i love, and sound very crisp and clear, compared to a single mono rear facing speaker on most phones. also includes dual led ring flash which is a fantastic bonus. the camera is not the best but significantly better than average as it can record 4k at 30 frames per second, most cameras still use 1080p. although, low-light recording is not so great. the exclusion of a sd card slot is may be a negative to other people but not me. another advantage is that this is a nexus device, pure vanilla android at its finest and the first in-line to receive android updates. to finally wrap my review up, this handset is a fantastic device. i love it and is now my daily driver. with yet for android nougat to come, the experience will be even better. anyone wanting a new but budget device that can compete with other players, get the nexus 6 as nothing else comes close right now .   my favorite phone .   phone came on time as promised, and appeared to be in good condition. however, i have had it a week now and after 4 days the phone stopped charging. i've tried several different cables, including ones that work on my wife's android phone, and none will charge this phone. i've left it charging all night the last 3 nights and in the morning it is at 7% or less. the phone battery actually goes down while it's charged and you're using it. i'm very frustrated and upset. this seller had great reviews so i trusted them and purchased the phone, but beware of buying phones that appear to be in good working order when in all reality they are faulty .   best phone ever .  that is all .   i got this phone on sale for $250. it is pretty great, especially for that price. the 1440p screen is beautiful and the camera beats out the cameras on other phones of similar pricing .   i will buy this phone, again and again, this same phone iâ€‹ love this phone  .   bought it from an amazon warehouse deal; phone came brand new for $200 with only damage to the box. it's a great phone, i love the 2k amoled screen. due to the way the edges are, be careful if you are going to use a tempered glass screen protector, mine did the "holo effect" and has a small air pocket all the way around the screen. for those looking for a suggested rom, i am using the newest cm13 nightly and it works a treat .   i haven't been using smart phones for very long, and only started using android a year or so ago, but i will never buy another phone that isn't a nexus phone. the vanilla android coupled with regular updates and extensive support makes this a treat to own. the specs on this phone are very good, even 2 years into it there is nothing out there worth trading up for .   i have used this phone for over a year, no problems ever, i can honestly say this is by far the best phone i have ever owned. no even looking to upgrade. i love this phone .   great phone with latest android os and updates keeps on coming. used items arrived looking like new, with all the manuals and corresponding paperwork .   great phone, love it. fast deliver and excellent service by amazon .   good. the nexus line of phones is the way to go for powerusers these days. the unlocked bootloader makes installing custom roms and such much simpler. battery life for this phone had been great. i have dropped the phone numerous times and have not noticed any scratches or cracks on the screen. user interface is snappy and intuitive. awesome phone .   better than any other mobile phone i ever used .   the quality of this phone is questionable. i had a samsung which i dropped multiple from more than 4 feet and even once on the corners with minimal damage. this phone dropped on my desk from less than 6 inches and the screen is shattered .   best .   the most amazing phone i have ever owned. just upgraded to 7.0. i am so happy. thanks .   best phone ever for such a price! - 6 inch amoled quadhd - quad-core 2.7 ghz - ram 3 gb - qi wireless charging + quick charge - front stereo speakers - 4k video capable. bought it recently, this has replaced my samsung galaxy s5 and i don't miss my s5 anymore. love the ease of use, battery life, big screen and no bloatware aspect keeps me happy .   big screen and nice product ðÿ˜‰thin i love it .   best phone i bought and stock android pros large screen that's is beautiful to look at no bloatware since it's a nexus easy to unlock, root, backup battery life relatively thin consider it's a large phone grippy stock backcover price is right cons heavy not a one hand device unless you are ivo karlovic not waterproof. love the size and the fact that it is still motorola i actually picked this phone for both of those reasons. being unfamiliar with the newer 6p manufacturing, i was under the impression that this phone used the new c-type charging cords how ever this is not the case. standard micro usb port. on this model .   amazing phone for the price. beautiful screen that is very large but a good kind of large. it has the all the coolest features like turbo and wireless charging. build quality and thinness are amazing and the curved back is comfortable to hold. recently cracked my screen so my phone is no longer waterproof and most companies are charging 150+ to replace it. the camera is amazing too and shoots beautiful video but under performs in low light. my only problem is with the battery, i tend to get 4 hours on time with it and less when i use more intense apps .   first time i got this phone, everything was gorgeous but the screen didn't work. returned it and got a new one and it's the bomb .   screen was already on when i opened it. lol nice touch. this is the 64gb model. for the price .   can't be beat .   i'm one of those weirdos that prefer the original packaging .   knocked out or of the park .   and included head phones .   good. had this phone for over 2 years and now after cracking the display i've decided to leave a review for the this :) will start with the best - i bought it at a great deal, so the price was 1st good thing about this phone. the second thing which i loved the most is the display - 6" of high resolution. lte - is a common thing already, however for this one i would like to highlight that this is the first device which never had network issues: no signal loss and a constant internet speed, no matter how weak was the 4g coverage. another quality which i'd like to remark is the screen durability: i'm not the most accurate person and have a small kid which borrows the phone to watch cartoons on it. no visible scratches were present on the screen, even after 2 years of usage. the screen cracked after it fell from 3rd floor(to mention here, that even after that the phone is fully functional and the touchscreen works as well:)) one more thing to like it for - being a nexus phone, means to have a clean android, which is a great plus for me. the phone comes with a quick charger, another plus. in 40 mins of charging you have more than 70% of battery. as for the things i don't like about this phone - 1 hand usage is not possible for texting and other things which needs you to get to other part of the screen. another one is the camera - low light pictures are really bad :( and of course the battery - you have to play with the phone settings if you want to have it for 2 days in one charge. and the last thing - there is no micro sd slot. for me 32gb of storage was more than enough, but for people who takes 4k video(another good quality which i forgot to mention) the storage of 32gb would get full in less than 1 week. pros: - beautiful hardware - high-res display - great performance - android lollipop - reasonably priced for what it is cons: - battery life is average at best - not great for one-handed use - camera stumbles with low-light shots - no slot for sd card. the phone has amazing battery life. bought it used. i love the phone. i dont have any complaints so far regarding the phone .   my last phone was lg gflex. i absolutely loved it and had the biggest screen on the market for a time. this screen is approximately the same size. it has great quality graphics. it works so well with all my apps. the battery is eh but if you keep your screen at 50 percent or less you get a full day of med heavy use roughly. never reboots like my older phones. pretty fast processor .   great product. this is a great phone honestly .   great phone at a great price. still a solid phone years after it came out. just downloaded new android os (nougat). works great. screen size and quality is amazing. camera is a hit or a miss. some photos come out spectacular, some are just so so .   1 year after and still work fine. i buy it for my wife but looks like a pretty great phone, with all the upgrades from android at first hand. the camera is good. and you can play games without freezing the screen. also the camera open pretty quick, and the camera have hdr so the pictures are really cool, i mean capture great detail even in dark scenarios. i think is a great phone, with a really good performance for those who like to play games in the cellphone and have a lot of apps .   just to note, i did return this phone. that isn't to say it wasn't great, it just had a few issues. the biggest for me was that i could not get it to work on t-mobiles lte. not sure why, it just wouldn't! maybe i got the international version? it was definitely an old phone, maybe even a refurbished one. the battery took almost an hour of charging before i could even get it to turn on the first time. besides that, the back was ever so slightly coming off the phone. so, maybe it was refurbished, maybe it was just old. even though i returned it, i am sad to have it go. i only had it for two days, but it was very quick and the screen was very nice. the battery only lasted a few hours of moderate use, again, it's old, and the screen is huge. the speakers are fantastic, and loud. once i get refunded, i'm probably going to get the moto x pure. it's similar, but newer and just a little smaller .   is a really good phone but i can not connect to my home internet so i have to use more mobile data .   excelente .   switched from a n5 to the n6. it was a great move because the nexus 5 is very fragile ( power button). on this one, the hardware is made to last .   love this phone, can't believe i got it for this price! good battery life, crisp screen to watch movies on and play games, doesn't really overheat. charges really fast if you use the charger .   been using it for 2 weeks now and i'm very satisfied, it is brand new with original box .   bought this factory unlocked 2014 google nexus 6 to replace my totaled 2013 nexus 5 so i can experience having a phablet as my daily device during my lifetime, and so i can upgrade to android 7.0 nougat as soon as the factory image for this phone is readily available straight from google via firmware uploading hooked up to my homebuilt computer via usb .   excellent phone. 32gb enough for everything, even a whole mp4 movie! monthly updates since over a year. lots of ram, keeps it running no matter how big fatbook gets .   great phone all around .   gifted to my sister in india, works smooth. no issues in an year of usage .   so quick and great memory .   the phone was in a very good condition, better than i expected. however, the charger doesn't work, so i have to charge my phone by my old charger instead .   for the age, i cant expect much, but the phone has several issues/glitches after just a little use. i love this phone. it's my first nexus and will not be the last waiting for the new one to come out now .   very pleased with his phone .   love this phone! still getting monthly security updates despite this being a 2014 model. definitely sticking with the nexus line from now on .   this may be the last really great american made phone for google. it has not only blazing speed on apps but huge storage space for them as well. the sad truth is it isn't being produced by motorola at this time. we need more great products like this that are produced here to create jobs for economy .   i bought this phone refurbished, i know that it should have been fixed, but it's not, the screen has a lot of dots which dont work. unhappy with this purchase. after years and years (of being a cheapskate), time came when i just needed to have me a quality cell phone .   i had to return it because it would not work with my carrier for phone calls (which was a strange anomaly). despite a few issues with their technical team, management was very receptive and came through in the end for the refund. impressed .   the back cover of the phone started coming off 3 months after i purchase it and the phone would not power on .   i've had this phone for about some time now, i can't say i love it but it's a nice phone for the price. the only problem that i ran into was the earpiece went out on mine, other than that it's a decent phone .   nexus 6 and project fi, perfect together .   i bought this phone to replace my previous xperia z3 which broke and wasn't worth fixing. i was really interested in a 6 inch phone with a 1440p screen. i will be comparing this with my previous phones: oneplus one, htc one m9, and xperia z3. size: this is definitely the biggest phone i have ever used, one more inch and it would be considered a tablet. although it is much bigger than my m9 and z3, it is only slightly bigger than the oneplus one. i have medium sized hands and didn't have any issues with carrying the phone. i was able to use it with one hand without too much trouble which was unexpected. screen: in my opinion, the nexus 6 had the best colors of the phones with its amoled. with the 1440p screen, it was impossible for me to see the pixels, even when putting it right in front of my eyes. this would probably be good for vr if a compatible headset was used (i have a cardboard that supports 6 inch phones, but it didn't work right) performance: the nexus 6 has good performance. it should perform better than the oneplus one and the z3 which are from the same generation. sadly, i do issues with navigation of the operating system where it seems to slow down. this is probably due to the 1440p screen so the nexus 6 has to push more pixels. audio: the audio for the phone is ok. it wasn't anything special, but isn't terrible either. the external speakers were better than my z3 and oneplus one. with headphones, it is decent as well. it is definitely better than the z3 which suffered from very low volumes. it is about equal to the oneplus one though. the m9 (and probably the m8) destroyed the nexus 6 in both aspects. battery life: the battery life was pretty good. it wasn't as good as the z3 or oneplus one, but was much better than the m9. the 1440p screen probably uses more power to use, but i was able to make the phone last an entire day, even with heavy use. build quality: the phone seems to be built like it can withstand a few falls. i haven't dropped it yet though so i can't really prove this. overall, i was satisfied with the phone. my only issue with it was the non-smooth navigation i was having, and the audio from the headphones (once you start using the m8/m9 to listen to music, the other phones start sounding worse). i would recommend this phone to people who are looking for a "phablet.". very reasonable  .   good quality. i was nervous that i would get an international version after reading some of the reviews. luckily mobilespree did send a model xt1103 that worked flawlessly with lte. the phone functioned 100% as promised. and it came with 6.0.1 marshmallow! there were no major scratches on the screen (had to look really really hard to see any!). slight wear near the charge port. back case had light scuffs. i put a screen protector & case on it so my phone looks good as new! awesome deal especially if you are happier saving $$$ instead of spending a small fortune on a phone. next time i need to buy a used phone, i'm definitely going to check mobilespree's inventory first .   very fast phone. colors are great though on the warmer side. if you want a phone without a lag that does some fast processing, this is it. camera is good in daylight. over all, not too impressed with the result of the camera. battery life is awesome .   i have my gps on all the time to track activity and yet it lasts almost 2 days. i don't know if it is my hearing, but the ear piece could have been a little louder. speakers are loud. phone is on the heavier side for some, to me it is great and it fits perfect in my hands. i love the screen size. i can never imagine a phone with a screen size smaller than this .   i have been using a nexus 6 for over 6 months. i love the simplicity and speed of the un-skinned os but do miss some of the simple features that some skins can offer may offer. nova launcher helped a great deal to give me most of the customization's i want. pro - call quality is top notch the speakers are load and clear great for podcasts and even music. the camera while not stellar is quite serviceable and easy to use outdoor video is great great color saturation a black levels on the screen always has the latest android updates con - terrible sunlight legibility colors may not be accurate enough for the visual pro user no sdcard expansion i find the usb port flaky don't waste your money on the 32gb model unless you never shoot video, save pictures and don't install games. this phone may be a little wide for some users, the 5.7 inch screen offered in the nexus 6p is close to the same real estate with out so much finger stretch. still a winner, even after is been discontinued .   stopped working after 1 month .   was one of the best phones i ever had, until lolipop upgrade (oficial, non rooted phone), since then wifi starts to fail time to time (it hangs turning on) for some months just turning off the phone and on again solves the problem, later just hang showing a bogus mac address 02:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 as the problem was generated by an official software upgrade i've contacted motorola an google, both wash their hands and do not provide any solution. then i look forward marshmallow upgrade but when it comes does not solve anything. finally i root the phone and start to try with some unofficial roms. found that with exodus rom if i put the phone in airplane mode and later turn on bluetooth and later the wifi it works. but it never works well again .   i've had this phone for more than a year i couldn't have asked for a better one the only thing i could ask for would be maybe more cases made for it but i know that's not the manufacturings problem but 10 out of 10 have recommended .   a lot. great phone for the price  .  no real issues as yet  .   very good big phone. i am using my nexus 6 half year and still very happy with it. i love it .   cool cellphone, too big but for me that's good. batery longs for all the day, the only complaint i have is when the cellphone enters in a battery saver mode, the cellphone starts to respond very slow, but that i think is more related of android version i'm using(android 6). very happy with my change from blackberry passport to this, plus added bonus of google project fi, $20 per month for unlimited talk and text and 1 gb data for $10, what you don't use you get a credit for the next month to lower your bill. project fi actively seeks out and use wifi first choice to lower your data usage plus has the ability to use three to four cellular carriers so shouldn't ever be any dead zones as far as cellular. only three google phones have this option, which by the way will pay for two nexus 6's in about 14 months! the screen size is great, camera is great .   great quality, near perfect condition,. the platform is great, but if the screen cracks be prepared to spend lots of money to replace it. unlike other phones, where i can replace the screen at home in 15 minutes or less, this one is significantly more complicated, and requires a professional repair .   awesome phone! everything works great. best phone i have ever had .   i love it. love this phone, second time purchasing it lol. good .   this thing is huge. it truly is a phablet. that came in handy when i used it to open the manual for a 1950's sicklebar mower and needed a clear view of an exploded assembly diagram .   fast, responsive, lightweight, durable. decent battery life, astounding screen. can't sing the praises enough .   had this phone since january and it just decides to turn off whenever it wants,i literally will be listening to music and it will just shut off for no good reason. the charge port is garbage, its gotten so loose, i can barely use the phone when charging it .   after a month of owning this phone , i am finding it to be a great big mistake. everything fails -$ 300.00 down the drain .   great phone overall. i loved the experience of android pure and this phone is great. i didn't experience any problems holding the phone and it has enough acres to type which makes it easy to type and click things. the only problem i had was that when i was using the phone, it all of a sudden started being stuck tapping on the left up and down the screen .   as expected. a bit outdated now, but otherwise great cell .   poor battery life .   these phones are junk and super breakable. this is the 3rd one i've purchased and the screen randomly flickers and has lines across it. i doubt it'll last long and i really wish project fi worked with iphones .   great. fast shipping. 10\10 phone. they totally didn't lie about the quality. i have been using this phone with tmobile for almost an year. i always stream music while driving. recently, while driving (may be i am passing by an area where tmobile signal strength is downgraded from lte to h or 3g .  ) suddenly data connection gets disconnected. only way to get it reconnected to lte is to restart. so i restart my phone at least 5 times a day on my way to work (15 miles) and back to home. and sometimes i restart more than 10 times if i am driving far. this has been happening for the last couple of months. very frustrating. this is definitely not a tmobile issue. couple of times, i stopped my car to check if it reconnects. being in the same location where my phone is not connected to lte, i restarted my phone and it connected to lte. that is a phone problem not a carrier problem. so much for $375 .   the quality and construction of the gorrila glass, tapped on screen and it cracked and startled me so dropped and hit my foot and then completely spider webbed. hopefully this was just a freak incident and the problem will be resolved .   works well. tmobile user. started out fine. it's been about 8 months with the phone. now constantly restarts. last update from google messed up the signal for lte so had a few days without service. the camera is average for pictures, not that good for low light shots. video is sub par, the continuous autofocus is bad, blurs out too much .   like new and with all the accesories .   i had the same one before and loved it. but i got this one as a refurbished after i dropped my original one and the wireless stopped working last month .   wanted a nexus to get on projectfi network and also a larger screen than 5.5" idol 3, which is a great phone, but my current carrier could not support wifi calling (cricket) and my cell signal in my home was nonexistent most of the time.this solves both problems at the same time and at a lower cost than an mvno. the phone is not only very attractive, it arrived in great condition. while the idol 3 is only very lightly "oem skinned", the nexus 6 is pure android and is pretty much guaranteed to get those monthly google security updates as well as system upgrades immediately for at least the next year. the qualcomm 805 chipset is very fast and the amoled display quite good with a 490ppi. the audio is very good with dual front facing speakers-although not as loud as the idol 3 jbl audio speakers, yet acceptably loud. camera is not top of the line, but better than a lot of more expensive phones sold new and more than acceptable results. for the price of $220 i'm more than happy .   google nexus is my taste  .   love it .   great value phone now! nexus phones hold up very well .   love the clean android experience .   highly recommended .   (the only thing i will say is that the front facing camera can sometimes take some pretty ugly photos .   it's a lighting problem for what i can tell .  ) but besides that, it's awesome .   camera didn't work,, returned it for full refund .   nice but has issues. i've had this phone for a year now (replaced a broken screen version) and it's nice. the screen is big and sharp, however this phone has issues with the camera. despite being on the latest android n build, the camera is still slow and buggy. the pro's are its a nexus so you get google updates right away, but if you are a camera lover i'd stay away from this model and go with the newer nexus phone .   pros: giant screen, stock android, multiple carrier support (including project fi), monthly security updates, quick charging, front facing dual speakers, android n developer preview is supported on this phone con: no fingerprint reader, mid range battery life, no usb type c. very good. my son loves it .   great picture and pure android .   i'd have to say this is the best phone i've ever owned. other phones i've had are the rezound and lg g2. the g2 was also a great phone but lack of support finally pushed me to a nexus. i have never felt the need to root or modify this phone. it's stock android and works as is. it's not loaded with bloat. also the fact that google pushes monthly security updates is a huge plus as well .   gorgeous but big (depending on your liking), good camera and ofc the best is software upgrades and support .   bought this for my wife who was on a first gen moto g (the second version with lte). the g was starting to get sluggish (though for the most part, was performing reasonably well). the nexus 6 was even better than i expected (my personal phone is a nexus 6p, which i love). to anyone who likes (or doesn't mind) a very large phablet, i highly recommend the nexus 6 at these prices. of course, it's not supposed to get android 7 (at least not officially), but it runs marshmallow very smoothly, and there will obviously be a lot of custom roms that will bring nougat to the phone .   pros: 1. this phone has two speakers at the front, which make the sound comes out loud and clear. 2. pure androi system, no carrier's bloatware. cons: 1. does not support miracast. this is a deal breaker for me. 2. a bit too big to hold in hand or put in pocket .   works great, people are super envious .   phone is great except for a problem with the volume getting constantly quieter when played through the speakers .   this is my second nexus 6 and i love it, it was shipped in the original box and sealed. inserted the sim card and worked as expected on the verizion network .   phone reboots constantly may have to return if i can't figure an easy fix. phone looked new but the problem is big when it reboots during phone calls .   i bought this phone after i accidentally dropped my 2013 moto x and broke the digitizer. i got the 64gb cloud white refurbished model for $330. first off, the shipping was spectacular. it arrived four days ahead of schedule, which i have never seen before. i think the one i got was one where the previous owner opened up the box, saw that the phone just did not suit their needs, and returned it. the phone was in mint condition, with all the original items inside the original oem box. when i booted the phone up, it had been charged halfway and upgraded to android marshmallow already. by the way, if you didn't know this phone is massive, though it is definitely manageable. in fact, i can pretty easily use it one handed, but it is best to use it two handed. once you go this big, however, you cannot go back. compared to this phone, the iphone 6s looks like a toy phone because it just seems so small. anyway, this phone is awesome. it is fluid, responsive, and fast. the screen, being an amoled, has intense colours that just cannot be beat. speaking of the screen, if you turn it down all the way and you're in a dark place, the screen turns slightly magenta tinted. however, seeing as you're in the dark, this is probably a good thing, as it functions kinda like a night shade. i digress. the lack of a fingerprint sensor i find is not a problem at all, and i rarely miss it. and the speakers are loud. holy crap, they are loud. those things are insane. try blasting some dubstep at full volume, and you'll see what i mean. and the audio quality stays good even at such volumes, as it doesn't sound very tinny at all. onto the os. android works very well on this phone, and seeing as it's a nexus with very good specs you probably will get software updates for a while. in fact, i'm typing this review from my nexus running the android n beta, which works awesome. occasionally, you notice some lagginess, but it is extremely minor and rare. also, the phone takes about 50 seconds (yes, i timed it) to boot up, so feel free to grab a glass of water while waiting for it. however, there are a few features missing, namely miracast. this is more of an android marshmallow and above thing, but the lack of miracast means that i can no longer cast my screen to my roku, which was a feature that i loved on my old moto x. they also could have added a bigger battery, but most of the time with moderate usage i can last a whole day easy with 20% or so to spare. and the lack of an ir blaster is a non issue, though would be cool. so overall, i love this phone, though the lack of a few features that are important to me bring this rating down to four stars. i highly recommend this phone to anyone considering it .   it feels like more than a 1.1 pound. constantly needs charging and get really hot. too big feels like a phablet. it didn't even last a year. got the nexus 5x and it's much better .   great phone but too big to holding in one hand .   i love this phone. big screen but i love it. maybe not the fastest or most current but it a great phone for me. i replaced my galaxy s5 with this and i love the screen. took a while to get used to the changes in the buttons and not having physical buttons but all good now. i love the phone. i love how fast it charges, and i love the screen real estate. easy to see items. only issue is that it is difficult to find a car mount that will fit the size of the phone. finally found one after several duds .   got usa version work s great for fiance very pleased also have 32gb version for my phone rock solid device. i really love this phone. coming from a samsung galaxy s5 it took a bit getting used to the size. now i love it and can't wait to get the next nexus .   this phone works great and love the large screen .   always speedy delivery and a good product .   endlessly reboots after update to latest android os marshmallow 6.0. should not have updated the phone. will be sending back to motorola for repair .   i purchased this phone about a year ago. i dropped it a couple of months ago and severely cracked the screen. i decided to get the nexus 5x instead of replacing the screen, and i ended up fixing the screen on my nexus 6. i have no major issues with the nexus 5x, but i just preferred the better/bigger screen and the superior speakers. the nexus 6 has been my favorite phone, and i am happy that i fixed it .   the design and function of the nexus 6 satisfies the requirements to be a flagship device for the nexus line. the following comprehensive review is based on project fi usage. operating system: default installation includes android 5 (lollipop) with early access to future updates. this version of android is a nice improvement over previous versions in terms of features and security. something as simple as including a flashlight app in the notification shade demonstrates how the developers spent time including small and big features. a big feature is device encryption which requires a pin for the device to boot up. i'll talk more about this encryption later. for root users, you will notice that automatic data toggling has been disabled. you will need to install an app to enable this feature again. security: the phone has built in device encryption so do not worry about the feds getting into your phone. however, this security comes at a price. numerous studies have demonstrated that this encryption slows down the phone. i have not seen big drops in speed but i have not pushed this phone to the limit yet. if you are not concerned about device security, you are better off rooting your phone and switching to another rom that has disabled encryption. your phone can still be locked but your storage files will be exposed. ideally, sensitive information should never be stored on portable devices so disabling encryption is not a deal breaker. form factor: the phone is big in your hands and pocket. itâ€™s slim though so you are not carrying a brick. typing with one hand is not as easy as other phones. display: big phone means big display. it is definitely nice to have lots of viewable screen. the bezel is thin so you don't lose much screen. since the screen is made of amoled, colors and brightness are good, but it could be better. compared to samsung super amoled displays, the colors are not as vibrant. regarding the brightness, both displays perform the same and are not bright enough when using the phone under direct sunlight. battery life: the non-removal battery can provide about 4 hours of screen on time under light data and wi-fi usage. based on my normal usage, i charge my phone every other day. the nexus 6 is better than most phones on the market and is an improvement. battery charging: this aspect is important because the nexus 6 has an edge over other phones. although it takes about 2 hours to reach a complete charge, the first 30 minutes is impressive. utilizing qualcomm quick charge capabilities, you will get at least 1% per minute. keep in mind that you need to use the wall charger to achieve these results. charging with usb connected to a computer is slow which is the same for all phones including iphones. as a result, charging via a computer is strongly not recommended. speakers: the front speakers are phenomenal. sounds are loud and crisp. once you start using front speakers you never want to use rear speakers on other phones again. the sound quality is truly amazing. rear camera: it seems to be a better than average camera. it performs great under lighted conditions. however, as with most phones, dark conditions can be improved. luckily, the built in camera app has a hdr mode which will enhance photos in dark lighting to something more usable. as a photographer, i still like to use my mirrorless camera to capture life's precious moments and feel that no camera phone can rival the performance of mirrorless camera. front camera: definitely, average quality is seen here. it would have been nice to have a better front lens but many phones have poor front cameras. the performance is fine for selfies but don't expect to be developing these photos. not even photoshop can save these photos. voice/data reception: motorola is known for having the best antennas and this phone lives up to the reputation. i receive lte coverage in areas where i should and get 3g connection in basement areas. compared to other samsung phones, nexus 6 is able to get better reception and data speeds. when you use this phone internationally, there are no problems roaming. switching between gsm and cdma networks is smooth. wi-fi reception: supporting wireless ac is great for future proofing. the phone supports many wireless network protocols and speeds. however, the wireless range is not the best. i have seen older phones able to get better reception. perhaps future updates will improve the range. in the end, the phone is still better than average. physical buttons: the phone has 3 buttons on the right side that are utilized well. taking screenshots is easy and using the volume buttons in the camera app as the shutter control is great. the buttons feel nice when pressed and do not stick. near field communication (nfc): this upcoming method of payment works as expected. a simple tap at many stores allows me to purchase items without opening my wallet. summary: now that the nexus 6 has been replaced by the nexus 6p, this phone can be purchased at a steal. this motorola phone has almost everything that you need and want from a nexus phone. sure, a fingerprint scanner would have been nice but it is not a deal breaker. there is a reason why the nexus 6 was the first phone to support project fi and google has chosen well .   the worst! the phone was still locked. after more than a dozen phone calls, we finally figured out that this phone was still tied to an account with a balance due. because of this, the carrier refused to unlock it. so the phone is pretty much worthless. we looked up the phone's imei number online, and found that the device had previously been reported lost or stolen. it strikes me as pretty dodgy, at best, to try and unload such a phone on anyone. edge cellular should be ashamed of themselves .   this was the american model. it works great and i am very happy with it. its ok but the camera has exposure problems. the nexus 6 is the new successor to google's very own nexus 5 from last year. this phone aims to be bigger and better than the already awesome nexus 5. this time motorola has decided to give it a shot to make this pure android experience so let's see if this year they nailed google's new flagship phone. the nexus 6 is big. when i say big, i mean really big. the only phone that comes close to being the size of this phone is the iphone 6 plus. this phone is almost the borderline of what determines the difference between a phone and a tablet. motorola is really stretching the size with this phone. the phone is a lot more rounded and curvaceous from last years model but i feel like it was made this way to make gripping such a big phone a lot easier. i do like the design of the device especially the metal bezels which give it a premium feel. the keys are not mushy and give a good tactile feedback. the phone utilizes stereo front facing speakers which make a bigger sound than phones with bottom or back speakers. it is very reminiscent to htc's boom sound speakers. overall the sound is better than the average cell phone but still has a long way to go in terms of sound. the quad hd amoled display is brilliant and crisp. i love the color reproduction, the blacks are nice and overall it is a very good screen. it is an eye candy to look at along with the material design of the new lollipop ui. android lollipop is smooth and flows really well with this phone. with my old nexus sometimes there are hickups with lollipop but that's not the problem here. games run smoothly with awesome frame rates. there isn't much to say except that it is one of the best performing phones of 2014. despite such a large battery on this phone battery life is average and not the best on the phone. i'm figuring that the quad hd screen and the processor does take a huge portion of the battery. overall depending on how much i used it, it ranged from 6-10 hours but then again i am a heavy user. the camera is a lot better than last years nexus 5 though i thought the nexus 5 had a decent camera. this phone can also shoot in 4k if you are into that. however, the camera isn't mind blowing in any way. it is good but if you are looking for a great cell phone camera, you are better off with the note 4 or iphone 6 plus. the nexus 6 is a great upgrade to the nexus 5. motorola did an amazing job at making the next generation of pure google android phones. if you are looking for a stock android phone with an amazing processing power(and your hands can actually handle this phone), than the nexus 6 might be for you .   great phone. this is my first time purchasing a used cell phone and so far so good excepting for the overheating which i guess is a common issue for this phone. very fast processor though. it looks and feels nice. definitely not a one-handed phone unless you have huge hands. got a good deal at amazon warehouse for $203. i noticed the battery drains faster than my old lg g2 probably coz of the bigger screen. i'm happy with it .   great phone! would strongly recommend this phone to anyone. still a great phone to buy in 2016! keep in mind that this phone is pretty big so if you have smaller hands you might want to reconsider. if you want to use this phone to watch movies or tv, it is a great device to watch media .   great phone. mint condition. recommended .   great phone that i got for a great price during the 2015 black friday sale. i used it for a few months before moving onto the moto x pure. the nexus 6 was just a tad big for me but otherwise worked wonderfully and i liked that it had band 12 for t-mobile .   i have had many android phones in the past but this one is by far the best. the processor is fast enough to handle any app that is available with ease. it has a large screen and great resolution. i can do everything with this phone. i haven't seen anything on the market that would sway me from this anytime soon. the gps is more accurate than my previous devices. the wifi/cellular hand off works better than the samsung galaxy s5 and note 3. the battery lasts all day with steady phone use and moderate data use; as well as a constant bluetooth connection for my watch and car. the charger that came with it charges the phone to full in a little less than an hour so i can use it constantly and never fear a dead battery. the only downside i can think of is that there is no expandable memory. it really is not an issue though because i have hundreds of songs, pictures, videos and apps and am nowhere near the 64gb mark. if you are looking for a great phone that looks good will stay great for a couple years then this is the phone for you .   great quality phone as expected. i'm very happy :). love this phone. got a great deal. it is very large but i got used to it quickly. i have a hard time fitting it in my back pocket though .   clear screen, rich quality great amount of storage, the price doesn't do it justice .   excelente. exactly as advertised .   excellent phone .   i bought it at black friday with the amazing price. i used it for about 8 months and all is good .   the phone works great but the camera occasionally shows some weird color lines when i take pictures. not sure if it's normal for this phone or just i got bad ones. both phones have the same problem. i love big and thin phones and this is both. over a year old and it is still running strong .   bought this back in november 2015 and it has been an absolutely solid device. best phone i've ever owned. :d. he gave me a really good price. i got the phone for $39 dollars. the description said like new and it was cracked when it came in though .   great device, brightness leaves something to desire. especially in direct sunlight .   i have bought two of these now for other people. they are nice phones, it is a little large for my taste, but if the size is right for you, i don't know how you couldn't be happy with this phone .   great phone, get all the newest updates for android first. great buy .   so far so good. came in a sealed box with charger, but no manual. needed about 7 updates to get to current android 6.0.1 which tells me it was probably old stock. i replaced my broken nexus 6 with this one. arrived on time. everything as advertised. battery life is not great, but better than my year old phone .   nice phablet. fast delivery great phone thank you. the latest waterproof nexus device. waterproofness was a significant reason i went with this over the 6p or the note 3. it's pretty speedy and despite heavy multitasking, i've rarely encountered slowdown .   my phone's display screen was broken because of the attack from the ground. how do i fix it. hope to hear from you soon. thanks .   i actually would have given this phone far greater than 5 stars if this were last week however, things change! the phone is melting! that's right! the battery, as it turns out, overheats and it is a metal bodied phone. there have been reports of injury to persons while the phone is not even plugged in for charging as the battery expands and the metal casing is not breathable. motorola refuses to replace my phone with a different model even though i am scared to death to use this phone since realizing the issue and seeing mine start coming apart right in front of my eyes! i've been arguing with them for days now and omg (!) the disrespect dished out by their so called "escalation person" is something i've not witnessed in my 50+ years of living on this earth! they told me, and i quote "your have two options. one is to send the phone to us to evaluate if it is a defect and if it is, we will replace it like for like. if we decide it is not, it will be returned to you in pieces". yes .   the person, andrew, said "in pieces"! the other option was to give them via a credit card, $500.00 to send me a phone that they charge $299.00 for, as a replacement, to ensure that they get the nexus back! i will never, ever, as long as i'm breathing and my body is still even slightly warm, purchase anything from motorola ever again! i have never experienced anything like this before! they are soooo fortunate that i was not injured by their phone! well, a minor burn .   blister that i couldn't figure out where it came from until three motorola people in a row asked "were you hurt by the phone" .   that's when the lightbulb went off in my head and i remembered not being able to figure out what burned my hand. this phone is a beautiful beautiful product that has a major flaw that could have easily been engineered away. as i type this, i already know what's going to happen. they are going to send me another motorola nexus 6 and if i get harmed by it (i won't sell it knowing what i know .   my morals will not allow me to), they've been forewarned that i fear using or even going near the phone but i'm not made out of money and don't have another phone to use! so i'm essentially hostage to them! i paid a lot for this phone and offered to accept a smaller, cheaper replacement phone so i would feel comfortable with it but nooo! andrew, the escalations person at motorola said "that's not our policy", "we can send the cheaper phone if you give us $500.00 security". that makes me sick! photo of my phone attached and here is one of the articles on the phone! [ .  ]. large screen great for internet browsing and playing games .   exceptional thank you for this product. less than 6 months after purchase the wifi has died. i'm trying to arrange a return on motorola's website and their system doesn't recognize my meid. i'm not confident that my repair will actually be covered by the 1 year warranty at this point .   great phone .   was in very good condition .   after 2 months, when i back from india, the phone can not identify my sim card, only work with cdma. and the worse things is the phone back is very hot after using for a while, very bad experience .   this is my first nexus and i was not disappointed. love the 6" screen. blacks look so good on the amoled screen. thought about upgrading to the 6p, but don't want to give up the wireless charging. people complain about the camera on these, but it's not that bad, i use this as a phone. i have a real camera for taking photos. would of loved a sd slot, but not a deal breaker. i don't see how i can go to a smaller phone after using this for so long .   good phone overall but with couple problems, dark screen during calls, volumes goes down if battery is under 50%. call quality is no the best. phone is huge which i like but also could be an issue, all the cons said, for the quality of the phone and price relation it is worth it .   called the customer service for an issue updating the anroid os. terrible service could not solve the issue. phone giving errors on update out of the box .   fantastic phone! could not recommend it too highly. excellent build quality and no manufacturer's add-ons/ins or customizations to ruin or interfere with the pure google android environment. get system updates the same time google employees get it on their own phones - buy nexus .   get it for $200 during bf 2015. great deal for a nice phone .   this is the best phone in the world! although the battery may have a higher capacity than is. thank you .   if you need max screen on an android, this is the best game in town. has been a generally excellent and reliable device for the last year. it's a little big for easy handheld use, but if you surf the net a lot the screen size is excellent. i love this phone. i use it with project fi and it works great. this is seriously the best phone i've ever purchased .   get it for 200$ in black friday ant worth ever cent. this phone is great in just about all aspects, save for one dear reader. save for one. the battery is not replaceable. this decision, be it for the purpose of getting you to buy a new phone sooner, be it for making a cheaper product, was a poor decision. the battery will be begin to lose its vigor before even a year of usage is complete. the battery will be like the tea kettle as it's water draws nigh to the end. it will run out of steam. my friends, you will enjoy the size and consistent speed of this phone, with minimal bloatware and clean stock ui. but the battray. the battray you may not remove to replace with a new one. you'll like. but ye may not love it .   first, the unit came in a box as the wrong color and imei does not match. second, had quite a bit of trouble getting it set up with google fi. some of these issues described here may be the fault of the device, or may be the operating system, or maybe fi, it's hard to tell. but the following problems exist and google fi and google product support have been unable to help. 1) handover from wifi to cell and cell to wifi does not work as fi promises. 2) frequently left with zero service when i know there is service available. frequently powering the phone completely off and back on will restore, but on a n6, this takes several minutes. 3) when i go from a wifi zone at home, travel to work, it sometimes will not connect to work wifi. sometimes i have to reboot or turn airplane mode on then off. 4) same as #3, almost every time i go from work to home it will not pick up the wifi. i have to reboot or turn airplane mode on and off. frequently also have to re-select access point and re-enter passwords. 5) device is now complaining that google play services needs an update to run. ok, so click through that and it brings me to the google play store to update, but no update is available: just the expected "open" app button. google had me try clearing caches and other steps. terminating a service at their suggestion cleared the error alert, but only for that session; after rebooting it comes back. hard to tell if this is the root of the other issues or not. 6) thinking it might be a good idea to update to android 6 and finding on web stories that it should be available to fi customers, i tried to update. but no updates are available. again, round and round with google, clearing caches, restarting in recovery mode to clear things to no avail. finally google starts telling me things like "take it back to where you purchased it for support" (bring it back to amazon - i think that won't work so well as it's been months since purchase!); and then "well, the carrier determines when updates are rolled out". ok, but google (fi) is my carrier. so google buys motorola, makes the nexus 6, sells it to me, google makes the device, the os, and is the carrier, yet i cannot update the device. hm, something is wrong here. 7) the next step i've been advised is wipe the device and restart and see what happens. great. a nice long weekend project .   great deal on thanks giving .   i ordered two phones and gifted one to my day and the another me and my boy playing with it. pros: beautiful hardware great performance high-res display android lollipop brings fresh design and features cheap priced for what it is battery life the phone comes with a 3,220mah battery, and, simply put, this lasts all day for me, and i often come home with 60% left in it. this is over two long commutes sitting on the phone with the screen on for hours. it's great. i've also had it last a full weekend without recharging. cons: not great for one-handed use camera stumbles with low-light shots. i have tried so many android flagships, my most recent was the xperia 3z. i was hesitant to not have the waterproof rating, but now with this in my hands i am so pleased with it. fast, responsive, gorgeous, and on the latest marshmallow. favorite phone ever and no need to root .   had it for 3 months, cracked it but it was my fault, 2 weeks later i broke it lol but i ordered another because i had no problem with the nexus 6, big phone , fast, 3 gigs of ram, ok camera(not the best when inside), everything is fine about this phone and i had to get it again .   i had already bought two of these phones and found that i could finally get it in a color that i wanted so i bought a spare as i don't see that i will want a new phone in 2 years this phone has met every expectation of speed screen quality and size that i want to continue using these for years to come. the experience of a pure android phone without all the bloatware is by far the best android experience you can ever have there is no bogging down with 3 gigabytes of ram and the processors that are in this phone very fast. the phone being unlocked and not carrier specific i can go anywhere that makes me very happy. i took my sim card from my other nexus 6 popped it in phone came right up working no phone calls necessary. so i assume this would be the same with any carrier. on arrival the box was not sealed on the bottom the driver had me inspect and it appears that the glue has come undone as it was 109 degrees and not opened by an individual, the phone box did show some abrasions but nothing that implied any great damage . so far no problems for 5 days now and look forward to many more. and if by some chance that i do have a problem i know that amazon will stand behind their products. best phone that anyone can by at this price range .   i really don't know why it took me this long to get my first ever nexus device. i suppose i was waiting for the right moment for the android os to mature until the inclusion of material design in lollipop. i've been using android since 2011 and the first device i had was ces 2011 winner motorola atrix 4g with a fingerprint scanner. it's had gingerbread. i abandoned it when it couldn't get ice cream sandwich. i probably couldn't learned how to unlock bootloader, root, install recovery, etc. but i was so tired to the iphone as well. so i've jumped from one oem to the next none of them were nexus devices: lg, htc, blu -- although i must say that the htc one m7 was one of the finest phones i used. nexus 6 -- yes finally -- the first nexus phone i ever use. and boy, i am really loving it! stock android. so clean. quadhd amoled screen. so crisp. ois camera with 2160p @ 30fps. records at uhd 4k. it's so fine. with this 2014 specifications it still applies to most phones currently being released in early 2016. so this was purchased for half the price $299 (32gb unlocked) when it was being originally sold for $649 in 2014. it's water resistant (not sure if waterproof). has qi wireless charging capabilities. turbo charger (charges 50% in 1 hour). i have yet to test the battery life throughout daily use (will update review in 30 days). dual band ac wifi 2.4 and 5ghz. and the best news is that it was upgraded to marshmallow and likely to receive android n. since this was released in 2014 there's no fingerprint scanner but it has nfc for android pay. some things that are not so prime is that it only had 2mp front-facing selfie camera although it records at 1080p hd. i also notice that the back gets unusually warm (but not overly hot) when using with the turbo charger provided. overall this is a mighty fine android phone without the bloatware ever  .   i purchased a nexus 6 because, unfortunately, i broke my nexus 5--with which i was most happy--and found it was discontinued. i had misgivings because of the size, but eventually decided to do for it. i learned to live with the size, but the constant wi-fi as well as microphone problems are just too much .   great phone and great price .   great phone. pure android make it just like nexus 5 with better specs. i'm very satisfied .   works great. so far so good i really missed my nexus 6 and having this as a replacement was a lifesaver since they no longer manufacture this phone thank you very much .   i have used this for about 6 months now. this is the first nexus i had after 3 samsung in a row. as a device is great. it always have the last updates for os. i brought it twice from amazon as the first one i got i gave it as gift to one of my friends. for a normal usage with approx 10 minutes of call per day and data/wifi always on and email in background the battery last for up to 60-72 hours, which is great. when i use it for gps with waze (always online) the battery last for 4-5 hours until full depletion which is great for such a big screen. the 64 gb of storage space makes it enough at least for me. i don't feel like it needs any extension on microsd card. the fact that is unlocked does a great service when travelling from one country to another as you can just buy a prepaid card and enjoy the voip service from your home country without extra price. the turbo charger is also a great feature, helping you to get the battery charged in about one hour, so even if you forgot to charge it in the morning, just while you have the breakfast you can have it charged enough for the day. the camera is lovely. i have some friends which were asking me where did i buy it from because it behaves even better than the iphone they brought for their son. i am not an iphone user so i cannot evaluate this statement. the screen is not polarized so, as a difference to other phones it can be used in any position while wearing polarized glaces. one thing that i don't like is that maybe once in a couple of weeks it will need a restart because the memory consumption is too high (most likely some memory leaks .   ) the manufacturer advises to restart every day - i don't see that as necessary. overall, i don't understand why this phone was discontinued .   but that's the manufacturer's decision .   i love the motorola nexus 6 mostly for its size and amyloid screen but the moto x pure edition is more sophisticated. i own two of each .   this was my first phone without a removable battery that i have had. i took a leap of faith that the battery would work as expected, boy was i wrong. i went to rma it a few weeks after and motorolas process was long and tedious. the next day i got hospitalized for about a week and by the time i got home they denied my return and deleted my product regestration. by then i decided id rather be stuck on my wifi only note 4 with a broken screen then go through the return process again. fast forward 5 months i was sick and tired of using my crappy note 4 (was a great phone before that broke out of warranty) so i went though the return process again and sent it in a few days ago. i'm patiently waiting to hear back on if they can fix it or if i'm getting a new one .   the phone was in pristine condition condition, the charger block was the only with very light scuffs great .   that phone need a microphone. great product highly recommend to anybody smooth design good memory power nice resolutions takes super pictures .   great purchase. it,s great. i am using it for more than 6 months, no problem yet .   i cannot believe i haven't already written a review for this wonderful phone. i have been on the android train since donut and have changed phones every year or so. my method was to buy the previous year's flagship with the features i needed and this one is the ultimate success. incredibly powerful with 3gb of ram and the 32gb of storage is enough that i don't miss the sd card. processor is blazing and the display - well, what can you say about a 6-inch display? it is huge and clear and fast and  .   so forth and so on. i could go on praising it for many more lines but you get the idea. i love this phone. best one ever .   its okay phone .   phone was great but the phone box was scratched. bought a nexus 6 from this online store in june of 2016. ordered it on a saturday night. received it on a wednesday afternoon. the phone that shipped was the correct phone and color and was in excellent condition. the nexus box it shipped in was slightly dinged and worn but the phone looked brand new. ill never buy a new phone again as long as these guys are around. i paid i think around 275, (not looking at the receipt), google wanted like 500 new. glad i made this purchase and would recommend them .   fantastic phone for the prce. perfect. great phone at a great price. use it for google fi .   very well.worth recommending. the camera and camera app suck .   it takes a few seconds to take a picture and at least once a week the app freezes so badly that you have to restart the phone. over 10% of my pictures are unusable because of the retarded delay. apple is 10 times better. with average use the battery barely lasts 6 hours .   it's ok. phone works pretty well. not too slow, and screen is clear and bright. love this phone .   mobile hardware is plateauing like desktop pc hardware so, if you can find it in stock, buy behind the bleeding edge curve. yesterday's flagship can still do today's job without a problem for a fraction of the price. i'm still trying to get used to "phablet" size since i came from a 5.25" phone. on paper that extra inch in form factor doesn't seem like much but in the hand it is quite a difference and a protective case makes it even worse. i got the phone and connected it to my local wifi after which it downloaded a pair of android 5.x updates followed by android marshmallow 6 on its own without prompting: all i had to do was tell the phone to install the updates. not being dependent on the cellphone networks for os patches and updates is worth the nexus price of admission alone - in this case just over $300 while the current flagship nexus 6p is going for nearly twice that. sure the huawei 6p is better in an absolute sense, but in relative price vs. performance the motorola 6 is just absurdly good. after the updates i got an at&t sim card a few days later, plugged it in, and was good to go. overall the phone is fast, snappy, and battery life is excellent. my only complaint so far is the phone takes quite a long time to reboot if you end up having to do that .   purchased from jp mobile for $190. was said to have had several scratches and scuffs on it, came in mint, nearly brand new condition. bought it to replace my galaxy s6 edge that i was growing tired of. granted on paper the edge is better than the n6, but after having it for one day so far, everything about the n6 seems snappier and faster than my former edge. very very pleased with the device and seller .   great phone. live the large display and the fact that it's a nexus! nothing really beats nexus!:-). solid build quality and best stock android experience .   this is piece of a crap. don't buy it. bought it and give it my niece as a gift and after 3 months' use, it stopped working now .   got this for my roommate for his birthday. he wanted an upgrade for his cricket phone. this is larger than my galaxy s7, and has most of the same basic features. we chose this over a used galaxy note/s series phone because we decided it's better to get a new phone and he didn't want to have a contract .   not the dream machine i hoped it would be. stalls and stutters, also is actually too big - and i have large hands! camera does not always fire up when you need it. speakers are loud and pointing directly at you(great!) . screen is beautiful. but because of the flaky camera, i don't recommend this .   that's great .   spectacular phone for $200 (black friday 2015). this is an excellent phone, rooted and running on android n beta. android n is still having a lot of bugs. lots of custom roms for it .   best phone i've ever had. what a a great phone it's big, barely fits into my pocket. it works great and has fantastic battery life. this is a 2 handed phone, but it really should also be considered a small tablet. since i do a lot of travelling, this allows me to bring one device and have all my needs met. the phone is great, because i only use a bluetooth headset when making call. i don't like having high powered radio waves near my brain, plus it's more comfortable. the screen is sharp and bright, perfect touch sensitivity. plus since i have dropped it a few times, takes a beating and keeps on ticking. it even is basically waterproof, but i haven't fully tested that feature and hopefully never will. the other thing that makes me smile, is the wireless charging, just slip my phone on the charger and it does the rest. for those rare times when the battery is low, the turbo charger is a god send. in 5-15 minutes of charging , i have enough juice for long while .    .  this phone is still pretty good overall! battery life is amazing, stock android is amazing, camera is amazing! basically, i am very happy with all aspects of this phone and i look forward to keeping it for the years to come .   love, love, love this phone .   bought to work with project fi, fairly fast, call quailty good. 6 months no complaints yet .   the buyer is great and the phone was in good condition without any scratch its like a new .   amazing phone that came in amazing speed. fully recommend it. absolutely love it. bought a note 4 at the same time, the nexus blows the note 4 away the pure android is so fast and clean love it .   . ***** 5 stars for the phone. 2 stars taken of for build. the phone needs no reviews. the word is already out. it is a great phone, and for a not so phony person, i.e myself, i love this phone. i have big hands, so screen fits well. my only disappointment is, i.e. the glass screen doesn't seems to be gorilla by its strength. i have had several gorilla glass 1 & 2 phones, dropped them multiple times, didnt crack, until the impact was big and obvious. this oe slipped out of my hand once, with a bumper cover on and a temper glass, still the glass cracked, and changing the screen is as good as buying a new phone. just 2 weeks man .   first off let's start with the good of the devices - large screen - this screen is amazing for media viewing as the phone sports a massive 6 inch display. i can honestly say i loved watching youtube videos on this phone. fast updates - there's nothing like a nexus device. running a phone the way google envisioned it with blazing fast updates and the latest and greatest features is the only way to go in my opinion. no bloatware - buying this phone unlocked without any carrier bloat makes this phone run smoothly and your screen won't feel cluttered with non useful apps. front facing speakers - i think we all know that answers itself. now let me get started with some of it's caveats- yellow hue - now this seemed to be the common theme with this phone. coming with a amoled display makes for awesome deep blacks but unfortunately this panel seems to have a soft yellow hue on the screen that is only noticeable mainly when the screen displays something white but it's there. it wasn't a big deal for me but did want to let people know because it might bother them screen size - although a major pro it is somewhat of a con as it does make the device somewhat odd to hold. also if you are one to add a case like i am it only makes it more difficult to handle. battery life - now although everyone's use is different and it did get better with marshmallow (especially stand by time) a phone of this size i felt should've had a bigger battery, especially with a qhd display. overall i would recommend this phone for the pure stock android experience alone, but if you can't handle a six inch display this is definitely not going to work out for you .   sound has been coming in/out. checked online fixes, which i tried and it kinda worked. the last 2 steps are a full reset or warranty work. it's been less than a year with technical problems. i am so sad about this phone from google. i love google products but motorolla .   hasn't been as strong as samsung. good handphone .   i like my samsung better .   ok. the phone is great i haven't had a problem yet. i would not get in to the spec comparison as there are pages and pages available for this. i use this phone along with work s6. its camera, screen and computing power are good, due to larger screen i end up using this more than s6. battery power is sufficient and last almost 12 hrs of brutal use. i restart it once in few days to keep os fresh. the thing i most like is fast updates to android, i dont have to wait a single day for new release. my only complain is the charging port. only the original cable fits well, for rest it seems to be a bit lose .   horrible experience. i am a long time android fan and had numerous high end phones. i am very disappointed with the nexus 6 and even more with motorola. i bought the phone here on amazon in december 2015. shortly after that the phone became non-responsive, especially the camera and required constant reboots. also, the phone made strange noises (similar to the one that a cd drive makes after you insert a disc) when surfing the web or activating apps. i asked motorola for a replacement and was asked to pay $25 premium for an advance exchange (i.e., they will send a device to me and only then i will send the defective phone back to them). i reluctantly agreed as i didn't have a replacement phone. the replacement phone (a refurbished, by the way) has the same issues. i called and paid another $25 for another exchange (they promised it will be refunded). the third device couldn't even make calls, so i asked to return the replacement and keep the device i already had. had to wait for two weeks until they processed the return of the replacement. meanwhile they kept sending me threatening emails that i need to ship back the original defective device i received or else my card will be charged. called everyday to explain that i am keeping this device and returning the replacement and was promised that my card will not be charged. i returned the replacement only to find out they did charge my card - $535. i am now trying to get this refunded. summary - paid for a new defective phone + paid 2 times $25 for replacements that didn't work + $535 for a replacement that i returned. let other buyers of motorola phone beware .   looks & works like its brand new .   cellphones have never been something i've particularly treasured, rather i have always considered them by a lesser measure: things â€” utilitarian devices for contemporary communication and connectivity needs. now, my heart bleeds as this phone supersedes all expectations. i got the moto nexus 6 to replace an aging phone and my former disdain for smart-a$$ phones is now gone. this nexus 6 provides joy and that is a surprise. the speakers â€” awesome; the display â€” easy on the eyes. for the first time ever i have found myself delighted by a mobile device. this phone rocks and the stock android is really *nice.* i would buy it again and do highly recommend it to all my friends. so i wrote this poem because i do not think you can go wrong even if you buy what is now an older model .   i got this phone for the big display, and i was not disappointed, i have owned it for 6 and so far no issues. this phone rocks .  so fast never freezes .  i can have 30 apps and windows open at once .  screen is huge and so clear .  good sound .   even wireless charging .   buy it .   good but defective. i love the phone, tragically this phone has some color timing issues but i didn't want to return it because i figured it'd be too much trouble and i can't live long without a smartphone, i grew up with them, i'm gonna grow more with them and i'm gonna be charging my phone the day before i die .   shipping and quality of the device were both great! i have had it for a few months now and have zero complaints .   i bought this phone the end of november and received it the middle of december. the phone was amazing while it worked, but it has become an extremely expensive $400 paperweight. the phone crashed in march, 3 months after i received it .   screen at low brightness looks purple, known issue, not as good as my galaxy note, but ok for the black friday price .   been my daily driver for more than 6 months now. very reliable and i love the 2 front-facing speakers .   i just recieved my phone and the screen was cracked .   best phone so far it came fast and well packaged and i was so surprised when i open the box it came with a turbo charger which charges my phone really fast. i bought the used 64 gb from the amazon warehouse deals. pretty cool. the item looked new, i couldn't even see a single scratch, all the brochures, charger etc seemed to be in there, so yeah, it's a really good deal. so this is my first smartphone ever, so i am sure i am very biased, but this phone is pretty cool. the display is amazing, and i went over to verizon to get it activated. it was a breeze. they transferred the number, and then all my contacts, and it took just 10 mins. yes, this phone is pretty big, and it really is a phablet. but i am ok with the size, and it seems exactly what i needed. simple android phone for such a great price .   big, but quick and easy to use. wish it had a fingerprint sensor. the phone is ok the glass broke after one week one fall;(. the phone came in and worked perfectly with no scratches or dings. great product. the best features are the screen for streaming and games, and the speaker for music and talk .   love everything about this phone .   slow down after a few months. good. i would rate this product 3.5/5. the price has dropped significantly since it's release and has become competitive with budget phones in terms of price point. the screen size, although troublesome at first, has become manageable now. the quick updates are great and the performance is good. the camera is actually pretty decent with google's superb hdr processing. battery life is decent, an average of about 4-4.5 hours of screen on time with heavy usage. the reason why it only achieves 3.5/5 stars is as follows: 1. the vibration motor is extremely loud, cheap, and cannot be adjusted. also google's stock android operating system has no way to disable vibration unless you disable all notifications 2. the back plastic cover is extremely cheap feeling, slippery, and a fingerprint magnet. the least motorola could have done is use the same material as on the nexus 5 and nexus 7. 3. the speaker sometimes has issues with stereo and is generally buggy (the volume will sometimes go on for a second even when muted, sometimes it has trouble adjusting to volume). 4. the usb port is built extremely cheap and broke, this is not a dust problem, and since the usb is soldered onto the main board, it cannot be replaced easily. 5. the amoled screen is a last gen (2013 amoled panel rather than 2014) and has burn in issues. for those of you who don't believe amoled screen degradation is a real problem, compare the white colors of your old nexus 6 to a brand new nexus 6. the whites are extremely yellow in comparison .   it keeps restarting by itself sometimes, and sometimes u cannot hear when ppl call u. i had nexus 4 for almost 4 years, it was great, this nexus 6 make me not wanna buy nexus product anymore,. i pay two hundred dollars plus taxes that is why i'm ok with the cellphone but it has many issues .   awesome phone. awesome phone! this phone answered all my needs. it's big, fast, plenty of ram, and plenty of storage space .   100% satisfied .   (review by nick bhend) the nexus 6 is an excellent 2 year old smartphone that holds up very well against the mid to high-end smartphones of today. the 6 inch, 1440p amoled display immediately steals the show with wide viewing angles, clarity, and an overall finesse that holds it's own compared to mid rangers like the honor 7, the nexus 5x, and even high end models such as the iphone 6s plus. colors aren't as saturated as samsung's galaxy line, and aren't as accurate as the iphone's, but provide a nice middle ground between the two, offering colors that pop that aren't super saturated. moving to the top and bottom of the display are the two front facing speakers that deliver powerful, almost boomsoud-like sound. a stereo effect is also effectively produced. there is also a 2 megapixel front-facing camera on the front of the device that is a little below average compared to current smartphones today. moving on to the back is a 13 megapixel camera capable of shooting 4k video at 30 fps (no slow-motion though). it can produce good photos under the right conditions, but on average produces average photos that won't blow you away, but will still be nice nonetheless. it would have been nice to see a better camera (especially considering the nexus line's history of bad cameras). moving under the hood, the nexus 6 sports a snapdragon 805 quad core chip paired with an adreno 420 gpu along with 3gb of ram and 32 or 64gb of internal storage, which is sadly not expandable. the nexus 6 plows through basic tasks such as web browsing, watching videos, and email and even holds up on more demanding games and apps such as mortal kombat x and hitman: sniper. battery life is strong with a 3220 mah battery that will get you through 1 day with about 20% left in the tank. in comparison to some mid to high end smartphones, the nexus 6 stands as a worthy contender, especially considering it's new price of 300$ on amazon (even dropping to 270$ on sale). simply put, this is the phone to beat in the sub 350$ range and can even hang around the 400-550$ crowd with ease. and did i mention it runs stock android, and is in a priority position for the latest updates from google? icing on the cake. a feature-rich, beautiful phone that provides the stock android experience, the nexus 6 is an amazing phone worth every penny. ** 4.5/5 ** pros: big, beautiful display, great performance, awesome battery life, turbo charging, and stock android cons: no expandable storage and the cameras could be a little better. the phone also heats up quite a bit when playing graphically intensive games or while watching a video and charging .   good. using it more frequently than my iphone 6s. â the cellphone is good, all features as promised. the reason i give 3 stars is because the screen sometimes acts badly wrong,, it divides in squares and the only way to fix it is shutting down the screen. i tought on send it back but i'm outside de us and the shipping is expensive. it's a great phone, best quality pictures and storage. wonderful phone, huge screen, is still fully supported by google. bought 32 gb phone new for $299. definitely worth the price .   by far and away the best android phone i have had. imho, far better than my old samsung, and much better than the iphone 6+. it does everything, very well .   it is the same size as the samsung galaxy note (except it doesn't come with a convenient stylus). i love that it doesn't come with the hundreds of prepackaged garbage apps that samsung and the others force on you and don't let you remove. but i dislike that it does not have expandable memory. also i was disappointed with some of the native apps it does have. the camera app particularly lacked a lot of features, taking a picture in the moment (within a second) is unlikely to produce any quality results - or take a picture at all. panoramas took forever to composite and it has a lot of trouble focusing/exposing correctly - sometimes refusing to even take a picture because it can't determine what it should focus on. ended up downloading a lot of 3rd party apps to control camera as well as audio/video playback, file exploring, etc. while the screen is nice, it is a little too big. i have large hands but i often have trouble using one handed (palm of thumb often clicking unintentionally when reaching across the screen to the other side.). phone works great. in my opinion, motorola has completely changed the game with this phone (and the moto x pure, which i also own). not clear on whether the nexus will continue under google's tutelage or be discontinued - whatever. the moto x pure is similar enough for my purposes. i've dumped samsung (which are also excellent phones, but notably more expensive) and i will only be buying high end motorola phones at the ~ $400 for the foreseeable future. these folks got it right: * sell unlocked, high-quality gsm phones * install capable cpus and ram for modern android apps * do not install annoying crapware motorola follows these principles beautifully - at least with the unlocked nexus and moto x pure phones. i'm a happy guy .   the phone rings quietly but besides that it is a great phone .   great phone. size doesn't bother me except it isn't a one - handed phone .   i purchased this phone from soonersoft electronics and was extremely satisfied! it came with the charger, and additional accessories not usually included. it was in mint condition for a fraction of what the other sellers wanted to charge. the only thing it didn't have was the box (but let's be honest, who even needs that .  ) and it was already turned on, updated to android n and unlocked and ready to go when i received it. i found it extremely convenient as i hate waiting for everything to update and set up when i buy a new device. it charges extremely fast within (about halfway within 15-30 minutes) and dies out after extremely heavy usage (constant app usage and video streaming) by about 8pm (assuming i unplugged it at 6am). it also seems to boost my phone carrier's signal in places where i would have never been able to receive data originally. i highly recommend this particular seller and device .   wonderful phone. i use it everyday and use it hard. great battery, screen and speedy too .   great product. camera is total garbage .   product has known issues with wifi connectivity. mine is nearly useless at this point after owning it less than two months. and amazon won't allow me to return it. what good is an overpriced brick .   best smart phone i have ever had, i can't go back to cheap smart phones every again. this phone is just as good as a iphone whatever or a samsung galaxy 6 at half the price and you get better update straight from google .   great phone. definitely get a protective case for it .   excellent seller and product .   i really like this phone, i don't think its as big as my family think it is. i like to read my e-books on the phone and this is a nice size for that .   this is a great phone, i have no lag in any application i use, however, the battery life is dismal. if i don't charge it on the drive home from work, it will go dead after having a 100% charge in the morning .   still loving it after many months .   pros: the phone is great as far as usability, it replaced my huawei ascent mate 2 which was good but never got security updates nor software updates. cons: battery life is atrocious, i mean do not stray far from a charger or external batter. with frequent use, expect about 3-4 hours tops. little use about 8 hours tops. this is after doing complete resets .   works great, brand new and unlocked. had it for past 5 months and no problems at all .   loved the phone. great android phone! very snappy, great screen, charges very fast. nice to get timely updates from google as they come out. i grew up and switched to an iphone, but this is the only android at the moment i would go back to .   liked this phone very much .   high cost performance, stable and clean inside .   i love it, so far it works very good .   i returned the phone after realizing the speaker was busted and had to pay for shipping .   phone looks great, but it's missing 32gb.i ordered the 64gb version and received the 32gb one. come on, it's a simple little number, get it together warehouse .   i bought it on thanksgiving sale and its a great phone. get software updates immediately and everything works. only thing i don't like is the size of google launcher icons. its just too big .   it was used, but hardly. it is super-duper. my friends want one .   camera was not working upon arrival. read reviews and it is a common issue on this cel :(. very satisfied .   good product .   at first you may think the screen is huge, but it's an awesome, crisp screen, great for e-books. my previous device was a nexus 7 tablet (1 inch larger), which has slightly better resolution, but the nexus 6 is small enough to fit into your pocket, while being large enough to double as a tablet. it's the ideal size, in my opinion. sound quality is good, and having pure android is great because you get updates soon as they roll out (unlike modified android os, which is found on most other brand names). i got mine from a private seller in like-new condition, and have been very happy with it .   it worked about a month and the it died .   authentic! no problems yet. great phone. i love this phone! the battery life is incredible in it. i am always playing on my phone and somehow i hardly ever have to charge my phone. i think it works really well, i had an lg g3 before this and have found that this nexus 6 is way better. i haven't had any issues with this phone and i have had it since oct. 2015. it's nice and big and has a great looking screen. my biggest pet peeve is the screen burn. i can see the navigational buttons on the bottom and the icons at the top (where the clock/wifi/signal) is. it's not interfering with any of my apps really, but i can see it pretty clearly which is just irritating to see. other than that the phone is just really good. i would love to be able to make more choices for the wallpaper, but that's such a small thing that it doesn't really matter .   it is big, but the front facing speakers are great, the screen is very good, and it is a nice phone to hold (without a case). the camera is good but could be better .   great phone, records in 4k, had to get a sim card from sprint, which they didn't have in any store, so i had to get it by mail. thing i don't like is the location of the power and volume buttons, all in the middle and all the same size, i liked it better on my old nexus 5 .   nice phone but i had to return it due to network signal problem nice phone though .   great shape and size with a wide display. great battery life. love it. great phone! i wish they didn't discontinue it, works fine with cricket wireless. best phone i ever had, though it's definitely on the large side. owned for around ~ 9 months so far. no regrets on ditching verizon for google fi and this phone .   my mic is not working and when i call my friends they say they can't hear anything due to some bull s*** background noise .  checked on google found that .  its some problem with the noise cancellation thing .  go for apple .  i have suffered a nexus 6 n note 2 .  surely shifting to apple now .   best bang for the buck out there for android. this phone is great, this one i got is able to traverse into verizon land and at&t land and be capable of lte .   was time to upgrade my phone and this one did not disappoint. hardware is great by todays standards still and at a fraction of the price , 64gb which is awesome. i stuck with my 8gb nexus 4 too long .   love it, would buy it again. it is good phone, not the best screen and other specs out there, but bought it for $200 .   best phone i ever owned  .   excellent phone for people who like it big, has a huge screen almost 6" which isn't for everyone i moved from iphone 6 plus so i got used to the size right away. its very fast phone i haven't experienced any issues or lag when i was using it. getting updates from google as soon as they released its huge plus. only complaint i would have about this phone is camera its really not up to the par with rest of the phone but its not horrible it does take good pictures but not premium camera that u might find in galaxy or iphones released at the same year as this phone. storage wise 32gb was more than enough for me i believe i had over 18gb free most of the time (i'm not mobile gamer and i didn't have any games on it ). look and build quality i really liked i actually bought two of these phones one is blue and other one white i preffered the white one it looks very nice .   awesome phone but missed my iphone 6s plus in less then 3 weeks - went back to the dark side .   pros - large screen tons of settings options for ultimate privacy google now is a huge plus tons of personalizing options to make the phone exactly how you want it incredible camera everything is great. cons - only one thing, there's no slot for a memory card .   still the best phone from google. annual and monthly updates without the carrier nonsense .   speed, size, screen etc are great. however, calls drop constantly. i'm not sure if it's an issue of settings they've configured for googlefi, which i don't use, but on any given call, whether wifi or cell, my calls drop consistently, sometimes as often as every 5 minutes. can't possibly recommend a phone that doesn't work as a phone .   amazing. well i myself didnt caught up the discount by amazon that offered $199 for a moto nexus 6, i was so regreted hence i booked that when it down to $249 from $349. during the days, i felt surprise by the fromer flagship- android device. maybe consider the fact that my previous phone is base on windows phone 8.1 os, which is really really realy in shortage of applications. still, duration is not its advantage--on screen maximum time is about 4 hours, due to the fact that its 2k screen is not really useful and also a battery killer. system updates were guaranteed by google, better than microsoft .   good .   after 1 year ,can not connect wifi,connect bluettooth. my wifi feature stop working completely within a a month and a week. everything else is fine i wish amazon had a 60-day return policy that gives you enough time to figure out what is going on .   great smartphone, great seller i'm very happy. love it, best phone ive ever owned. camera isnt that great if you are coming from a samsung product, but otherwise its leaps and bounds ahead of a lot of more modern devices .   excellent phone with almost up to date hardware. i love the frequent system software updates! i get the latest version of android months before the samsung, htc, lg and all the others! i do notice that the phone is starting to lag quite a bit. it's pretty noticeable! a system refresh will make it fast again, but after all the updates download and install, it will begin to lag again. i'm not a techie person so i cannot tell you what makes it do that. but overall, i am very happy with my purchase .   great product, one of the best android phone i have. perfect price for this perfect phone. (was 269$ on discount). great non-carrier dependent universal unlocked phone. you can use this phone with any carrier in the world. the only current technical advancement this phone lack is usb-c port which is fine with me since usb-c is in its infancy. i don't need to recharge the phone on a normal daily use. since it's a nexus phone, it gets the android updates before most other phones. motorola manufactured this nexus 6 and is better than my old nexus 5 by lg which started having problems with the battery, the camera then it when on a continuous rebooting loop. so i lost faith in lg. the phone is not as big as i thought it was. my girl friend has the same phone and she is comfortable handling it with her small hands. you cannot do many one handed operations with this phone because of it's massive size .   great phone at a great price. upgraded to marshmallow soon after purchase. best part of nexus devices is getting regular os and security updates without the carrier crapware. i have a bad habit of keeping 15-20 chrome tabs open all the time which causes some lag; lag not present under regular usage .   large phone, bit too big .   let me start by saying this is a great phone. i got it during the 250 deal here on amazon. it has a huge screen, but it isn't bulky in the slightest and it feels fantastic in your hand, due to the curved design. however this does cause some wobble if you try to type on a flat surface without stabilizing it. i think it's an even trade off. most everyone knew the nexus was curved before they bought it, so they shouldn't complain about the wobble. my only complaint about the nexus is the button placement. who in their right mind would lump the power and volume buttons next to each other ? i knew about this before purchasing, so i only deducted 1/4 star. 4 3/4 round to five in my book ;) . i like the stock android experience you get with the nexus. i don't like apple product, no offense to the hipsters out there. i also was not impressed by samsung's touchwiz. i want a fast phone that is highly customizable to suite my taste. i got it :) . if i want stock andorid with its speed and little quirks, i can have it. if i want something a little more refined ? i can download a third party laucher if i so choose. i'm running stock on marshmallow, and compared to my last phone (zte z998) android os, this is butter smooth, with no quirks. you want to delete any app on the phone ? sure go ahead .   that's part of the nexus experience. want a clean phone with no manufacture/carrier logos on the front ? got it! (unlocked version). it does have a classy m on the back that i am growing fond of. i'm using a case with a clear back. don't want a phone that's only optimized for one carrier ? this isn't. lastly, my samsung and apple friends seem kinda envious of my nexus. they don't say anything, but you can tell. this makes an s5 and s6 look small. it holds its own against the s6 especially considering it was produced in 2014. i wanted a phone that i could hold on to for 2+ years, like my last one. i'm not someone to upgrade just because a manufacture tells me to, i can think for myself :). leave a comment, if you want to know specifics. if this review helped you at all, please vote "yes". it would really help me out .   i've had it for a few months now and this is a great phone if you want pure android. handling gets some getting used to but just buy the right case and it will feel awesome .   i bought the used one, but i realized that the phone instead of being used it was refurbished o.o they had to say that, one phone that is water proof, the first time it gets refurbished, it lost its water proof, now my phone was damaged its card and it doesn't work any more .   wow i love this phone .   i have been wanting one since it was released but was out of my price rang. but now i have one and i will not give it up lol .   nice. excelente. great phone! it's big and, at times, a little awkward to work with, but i knew that going in. has all the features i was looking for (big high-res screen, forward mounted stereo speakers) at a great price. very solid build quality! would recommend it to anyone looking for a large android phone .   great phone great price. overall like it as i am using it with project fi. just wish it had micro usb c charging port. one has to plug the cable reverse unlike other phones .   good product. best phone i ever owned, tried the nexus 6p and you can have it the 6 is the whale smooth as silk fabulous with the android 6.0.1 system. i really wanted a new cell phone, but did not want to pay a ton for one of the flagship devices. t-mobile was selling the midnight blue version for $600+ dollars, so i was very happy to get this white one for $349. i thought i would like the "bare bones" android experience a lot more than i do, and i miss a lot of the functions from my previous samsung galaxy s4. it's a decent phone for the price, but i am glad that i didn't pay more than i did for it .   hi, after few months of using the phone wifi & bluetooth not working any more i tried all the solution on the internet nothing changed so please tell me how to fix this. i've been using my motorola nexus 6 for the last 4 months now (bought at end of december 2015) and for the money ($250 + tax), what an amazing smartphone. better than average battery life, good camera, good front facing speakers, amazing screen, love the size of the phone, and it's a nexus - i got android m and will see android n when it's released later this year. so far, very happy .   $399 at 2015 october, one of the best choice in mid range priced flagship let me get the spec out first: 2k 6 inch display 495 ppi snapdragon 805 3gb ram 64gb storage. imx214 13mgp consider this phone is released in 2014, this phone has some very decent spec, some of those can be considered pretty good in 2016, 3gb of ram with snapdragon 805 is quite powerful in today's standard, 2k display is still standard in 2016 flagship, but this display is not as good as those ones on samsung s7 or htc m10. it is a 6 inch 2k amoled display, which as a ppi of 495, it is very sharp, but the color is bit off just like most of amoled, it has a warm color(green and yellow tint), which in my case, i really like it. it goes really well with google's material design dark theme, but it depends on personal preference. the display turns pink in low brightness, which is one of the biggest flaws of this phone. this display does not get very bright either, max out at just over 300 nits, meaning that you will have a hard time seeing the display under the direct sun light. snapdragon 805 performs well on this device, it can still run the latest and greatest games on android platform without any issue at all. it does get hot sometimes, but nothing unacceptable. one of my favourite part of this phone is the two front firing speaking flaking the giant 6 inch display. they are very loud and deliver very good audio experiences, i have both the moto x 3rd gen and nexus 6p, but none of those two can beat the loudness of this phone. the only reason i switched from nexus 6 to nexus 6p is the fact that nexus 6 does not have a fingerprint sensor and the camera on it sucks. you can get some very good quality sot on it in day light, but don't expect it to produce any thing close to decent in low light .   nice one .   got this for when i signed up for google fi. i have had it for a few months and no complaints. i love the giant screen and the camera is great. i upgraded from a moto g so this was an insanely big improvement .   great device works perfectly, was cleanly packaged in box and was in perfect working order .   i bought the device a whole ago but it was in perfect condition and came in unlock. very happy with it since than .   the screen is not bright .   i ordered the n6 at a great price of 199$ at november 2015. this phone is overall great. even the big size - i found it as a big plus, as in our day's we moved already to do everything from the mobile. also, i carry it in my messenger shoulder bag so it doesn't matter to me. amazon's experience as always - the best .   i purchased the motorola nexus 6 after my lg g3 failed 13 months into my contract. for the price of the nexus 6 there is no other phone i would buy but this one. the phone runs great, turbocharging is a must-have, and the nexus experience is second to none. that being said there are a few cons: lowlight pictures are horrendous and the flash doesn't help much at all. the phone will often close out programs and lag during heavy usage. (snapchat is worst in my experience) the photos app and camera are inconvenient to navigate when searching through your photos. charging cable plug in about half-way making it appear unplugged, in my experience i absolutely tore through chargers as they wouldn't stay in the charging port. however it is qi wireless charging compatible so this is a way around the problem. in conclusion i would recommend this phone to anyone as it is an excellent deal. $350 is still a lot of money, however this is arguably the most premium phone available for that price point. i loved it so much i decided to purchase a nexus 6p .   this is a great phone and i love it. make the purchase .   not much bells and whistles like samsung, but it's a fantastic phone .   i had the blu advance 5.0 before this and that phone pushed me to get the nexus 6. i wanted to see what a $60 phone could get me which was not very far. i decided to spend the extra money and buy this one for under $400. i love it .   i didn't realize how huge it was but the screen has great quality. it's easy to do everything on this phone. i've had it for about a month or so. haven't had any problems so far .   the phone itself is beautiful and it works great. however, it is extremely prone to having the screen break if it is dropped. of the 6 people i know who own the phone, 4 of us have had the screen break in the first 6 months of owning it (with protective cases). to replace the screen is between $175 with $30 shipping, with the phones warranty. my advice would be to stay away from this phone unless you don't mind spending $200+ to replace it .   the n6 arrived in perfect condition, very happy with my team. and so far it works perfectly. very grateful to the seller for selling equipment excellent. i thought amazon has already certified this item  .   but when i got this .   its not up to the mark  .   battery not charging  .   it charge 1% in 1 hr. i would say not a good experience .   great phone. screen is big it runs fast and no extra software that can't be removed .   great phone! no issues to date. using with google fi. overall its great phone, the screen is bright and colorful, the front speakers are loud, call quality is very good and the advantage of having stock android makes it a winner. on the performance standpoint there is little to complain about, the phone is snappy and can have mutiple applications running at the same time without any problems. still i think it could be way faster with encryption disabled. now the downsides: no led indicator, previous nexus 5 and following nexus 5x both have a led indicator, now the tricky part is that the nexus 6 does have one but its disabled by the manufacturer and can only be used by rooting and loading a custom kernel. not everyone is willing to do all that work for a light. forced encryption: i get it that google wants to protect your information by having it encrypted, but they should have made this optional especially when there is an impact to performance .   best phone i ever used. long battery, loud speakers with fast processor.watching showtime on this. can't find any faults except, buy a case, my first phone broke the screen before my case arrived .   i'm going to show you how you can ditch verizon for good and save a ton of money by buying this phone. nexus 6: $350 google project fi service: ~$42/ month for unlimited talk and text and 2 gb of data per month. $350 + (24 months * $42) = $1,358 over a two year period. of course, if you use project fi as your carrier, you don't need to have the phone for 24 months. i am going to use this figure as a comparison measure for verizon plans. for comparison purposes, let's compare this to buying a new phone from verizon and using their current plan system. the nexus 6 debuted in late 2014, so let's compare to buying a new samsung galaxy s5, which came out a little earlier that year. verizon will charge you $23 per month for the samsung s5 over a 24 month period. with 1gb of data ($30/month) plus a monthly "line access fee" of $20, your monthly charge would be $73. $73 monthly bill * 24 months = $1,752 over a two year period. let's try a different scenario, a more realistic one. let's say you go into verizon and you want the latest and greatest phone, and they talk you up to their medium data plan, which is the one they push the most for individuals. let's say you get the samsung s7 and 3gb of data per month. that's $28/month for the phone and $45 for the data, plus the same $20 line access fee. that's $108 per month, or $2,592 over two years. you'd save $394 over a two year period if you bought the nexus 6 over a new samsung s5. you'd save $1,234 over a two year period if you bought this phone over a new samsung s7. as for the google project fi service, it's fantastic. they actually reimburse you for the data you don't use in a month. google it to learn more. as for the phone itself, i previously owned the moto x and this is a lot like that, only bigger. never had any problems with it .   even after two years almost the nexus 6 delivers blazing fast performance and uncompromised user experience. if your looking for an android phone and your on a budget, look nowhere else. the nexus will not disappoint .   absolutely awesome. sometimes it stutters, the camera lags a bit. good product. best phone i've ever owned. fast, long battery life and all the latest android updates .   coming from a galaxy s4, there's so much to love about the nexus 6. yes, it's a yuuuuge phone, but the media experience this phone delivers is unparalleled. every single app comes to life with the loud front facing speakers and large amoled screen. i'm not an avid snapchatter, but it's a pleasure going through snapchat clips with this phone. spotify is a whole new experience as i can leave the n6 anywhere in the bathroom and still hear it loud and clear in the shower. games are smooth and lag-free. call quality is on par with samsung devices. the only "negative" of this phone, is the camera. while some people claim the camera quality is abysmal, i haven't found that to be the case. with hdr turned on, it takes pictures just as well as the samsung galaxy s4 and my girlfriend's iphone 6s plus. there can be some focus issues with video recording (it tends to refocus the shot every now and then), which can be fixed by downloading a third party camera app. overall i highly recommend this phone, especially at the current prices. even though this phone is over a year old, it has top of the line specs that make it one of the best performing smartphones today, and will continue to stay relevant for years .   everything i expect from motorola and google. phone works great, smooth performance. even better since i bought it used from amazon for 1/3 the price .   i bought this product, it's "unlocked", i don't use ti because it's locked .   to start the phone i have to enter a pin, the message; to start android, enter the pin. please it's supousse to be am unlocked phone, so tell me the pin. i can't use it .   i'm not ok with this. it's second time that i have a problems buying wiht you, i repeat, my cell phone is locked and i bought an unlocked phone. good phone but very large. well it's nexus .   nuff said .   it was a present. although i prefer my nexus 6p this phone is still quite good. big screen, big battery, two front facing speakers, water resistant and was only for 199.99$ 32gb version on black friday. i can't complain .   i totally love this phone! updates frequently and works great. only issue charge only runs for a day .   love, love, love not having all the predownloaded crap that you can't delete. more importantly though is the phone. it's the best. i love it and best of all, i can actually use it .   awesome google phone. product arrived as expected and worked as i hoped it would. love it .   love it .   received a good and new phone .  pretty much liking this .   it's good.recommend to buy .   want to give 3.5 stars but cant, nothing wrong with the phone but amazon screwed me on this one, shipped 1 week late was late enough for me to loose my 10% cashback on chase rewards a total value of $40(this phone+couple other products), a call back to amazon went nowhere after a 2 hour conversation, these guys used to have great customer service, just sad. good. took about 2 minutes to trim my sim card down to nano sim and start using this phone. resolution is phenomenal and it is incredibly fast. this is the us spec phone. i would have no problem buying this phone again .   very,very good phone,like apple 6 plus. i bought it at the end of 2015 and i'm still using it, i had an iphone 6, this phone was released on 2014 but still a great phone! run smoothly and i don't have any problem of lag, the only thing that i miss is a better camera is 12 mpx but i think the photos could be better, the front camera is not a good one compared to others. but since im not a photgraphy fan the phone is ok for me .   defected camera lens. camera lens jump up and back on video recording mode or try to focus on camera mode .   bought for my wife for christmas and this this rocks and the black friday deal was just too good to pass up. kicking my self for not ordering one for my self .   bought this so i could root and dev with google vanilla os. so far so good, boot loader has been unlocked was rooted briefly but now i'm on android n preview 2. phone is my daily but i have its successor the nexus 6p. also a great phone.the nexus 6 is a tad bulky but it fits good in my oversized hands. i wish it more ram & gigabyte space but still a very good phone in my opinion .   phone gets hot. really like the phone .   love it. i got this phone before it was discontinued by the manufacturer. although the model is old. but the performance of the phone is pretty good. i like it a lot .   even for 200 dollars, i don't recommend people to buy nexus 6. regardless the screen, camera, and the whatever else, the battery make it a bad phone .   been using for 5 months. using 6.0.1 batt life is much better than nexus 5 but nexus 5 is faster. for the price and being a 1.5 year old flagship phone, speaker is great, decent camera, bright large screen, very powerful vibrate. it is an overall good mid range phone for 2016 at $250 but i wouldn't pay 500 when it first came out. bad: the usb port is garbage. if your cable male port is just a tick smaller the connection will come loose very easily, at least for mine. the curve screen is also a bit picky on screen protector. the rounded shape in the back is very unfriendly to work with when you lay it flat on the table as it will slide and rotate around .   overall a great smartphone with many high end features but you will need a case since it's very slippery .   great phone at a great price .   but the ota updates are severely delayed on the 2 i've gotten here. almost 5 months after my from google nexus 5 got marshmallow this one got it .   i bought this around november of 2015 and it is fantastic as my secondary device. battery life is not the best i've ever seen but it's also nothing to scoff at either. build quality is quite decent and i haven't had any quality control issues to mention. the screen is bright enough for use outdoors and the screen is huge. but that's something i expected before purchasing it. since it's a nexus phone, i often get updates directly from google and it's quite refreshing having used normal phones with bloatware. the sides are a little slippery but i threw a case on there and it has not been an issue at all. since it uses a micro usb port, i can continue using my old micro usb cables without upgrading to the new usb-c cables. call quality is quite decent and my callers have not complained about quality on their end. it is a little heavy for my taste but it's something i can live with. motorola made has made a great phone .   great phone, at an absolutely great price! this was a no brainer replacement for my son .   i initially loved this phone. the software and operating system are great and it is fast. however, the phone is very slippery and because it is so large it slips easily. this is a huge problem because the screen shatters easily. i have owned many phones and have been very rough with them, yet never have i had a screen break. this phone i purchased a cover and protective glass and yet with a minor drop the glass shattered .   this is a really great phone, if you look past the fact that it constantly drops from the network (lte for seconds, then 3g, then nothing, then waiting for something) and can't find my wifi connection even though i'm standing right next to the router .   gr8 .   it costs $200 .   this is a great phone. i came from a nexus 4 and this was a big upgrade in terms of speed, size and battery life. i had it for about 5 months and so far it works like it did when it first came out of the box .   good phone but it starts making a hissing noise whenever i listen to anything. i'll write a short review, since there's already tons of reviews for this item. camera blows. works great with google fi. can't wait for an upgraded nexus 6, since i pass on 6p .   i've owned the iphone 6, the lg optimus g, and i've played with many other flagship smartphones, and the nexus 6 is by far the best phone i've ever used. even though the backplate is made from plastic, it's excellent quality and has yet to accumulate any scratches despite the fact that i use this phone caseless every day for ergonomics. likewise, the gorilla glass on the screen is durable and has only developed a few faint micro-abrasions from months off use. speakers are excellent, camera is excellent (although i don't really care about this feature), and it has plenty of power and battery life to do whatever i need to do. even though this was released at around the same time, the nexus feels like a massive upgrade over the iphone 6 i used for almost a year. i can finally do all the things i was accustomed to doing (that the iphone can't do) on previous android phones. the unadulterated experience of using vanilla android could not be any more fluid, intuitive, robust and beautiful. the only real issue i have is the fact that the stock resolution is so high (2560 x 1440). this has the same vertical resolution as my $1000 21:9 monitor. it has a way higher resolution than my premium 2015 laptop. while it's great that the screen is so sharp with no discernible pixels, the hardware simply doesn't have the grunt to push a lot of 3d titles at good framerates. oddworld: munch's odyssey is unplayable, as are real racing and need for speed. you can still play most games, but hardcore mobile gamers may want to look elsewhere. the display also has a slight yellow tint, but it's only really noticeable when held side-by-side with displays that are more on the cool side of the gamut. overall, still the best smartphone i've ever owned .   this is a nice upgrade for anyone that is looking for a new phone. huge screen! fast cpu. and lots of good open source roms available .   looks like new and works like new .   this cellphone is dropping line easily. i have conversation with my friend last night for 25 min. the line was dropped for 10 times during 25 min .   love my big a$$ phone. wish it was a little borrower tho. the camera is not the best for more light shooting but it looks gorgeous in bright light. the screen is hard to see outside with the sun out. love the dual front speakers, love that it's water resistant, screen looks stunning and it's super fast and never lags. battery is good enough given that it's powering a 6" qhd screen. i get the latest updates as soon as they come out, no bloatware, i can customize it to my style. plenty of storage for music, movies or whatever you want. all in all a great phone for the price (i paid $299 for the 64gb version). excellent phone. great value. love love love. i bought for my parents this time. i have never met such a good design of nexus 6 in the world. why do you choose a popular iphone other than nexus 6 for your personality .   it works the same as my previous htc one, i really don't see why i had to spend three times the amount of money when nexus 6 satisfies all my cellphone needs. pro: everything works perfectly, no lag, nothing breaks after 6 months of use. extra pro: android updates come quicker. con: it doesn't have as many cool extra features that htc has, but it's not like it was a necessity in the first place. con: the camera isn't as good as htc, sometimes it's blurry, color contrast is bad, or quality is poor. it does get hot when it's charging or used for 2 hours straight, but nothing bad has happened so far .   got this as a replacement for a samsung galaxy s4. pros: - beautiful screen with a more than sufficient area for display - works with project fi which is the great - battery life with decent usage (wifi and data) potentially lasts through the day cons - the screen might be too big for a decent number of people. while the attraction is there using with one hand at times has resulted the phone falling on my face .   lol  .   but its difficult to go back to a smaller screen after that! definitely a phone that you will enjoy .   absolutely love my phone .   found a few issues i do not like but overall i give it an a. i want to like this device. i had the nexus 5 and hoped this was the next level up. i found that not to be the case. while the screen is larger, which is nice, i find the device less responsive overall. more frequent hangs and force closes. more importantly this device is prone to defects. i purchased it originally last june. by october, i had to return it because it wouldn't take a charge and was randomly resetting itself. motorola did have a nice policy though. since i was under warranty, repair would be free and for $25 they'd send me a replacement phone first (with a $500 hold on my cc) so i didn't have to do without. i thought that was reasonable and sent for the replacement. the new phone acted funny too. i noticed infrequent auto-resets and it did a funny thing with the scree where it was split into squares and tiled backwards. hard to describe, power cycling fixed that. and now the auto-resets are very frequent and on reboot, i get the message "your device is corrupt. it can't be trusted and may not work properly." i contacted motorola again and they offered the same deal. i guess i'll take it, but these $25 convenience charges are adding up for a phone that will probably be defective, again. i can see why they discontinued it. my advise? get the 6p or the 5x .   the phone works well with a few dislikes. i don't like that i can't use mp3's as a ringtone or have my photo gallery like other andriod phones. everything being tied into google is a bit problematic for me. i do love some of the features such as google pay and how seemless the apps work .   loved it, but my wife thought it too big to hold one-handed .   huge phone but solid .   great phone! smooth and fast .   this phone is a great bang for your buck. i love that it has 64gb storage and a big screen. it has a huge screen of course it has the best rom. the best rom being aosip .   great phone! i haven't had any problems with mine. my wife's had to go in for warranty work after a month .   excellent! it met my expectations .   it's great .   my phone is not working .   where should go for repair .   i still have the warranty period. great phone .   good. love the phone, hate the size. it's a fantastic phone but way too big and i've got big hands. the stock case is incredibly, and foolishly, slippery. coupled with the large size, you'll drop and break the phone in no time. as for features, i upgraded from a nexus 5. the n6 is markedly faster, had double the storage, and despite a bigger screen, has a longer lasting battery. the turbo charge feature is itself a fantastic perk. the speaker quality is stunning. double, front facing speakers delivery just deafening volume if you need. very good audio quality. camera will do 4k uhd video. camera is fast and delivers excellent pics. i don't like the volume and power button locations, as they are hard to manipulate. in typical nexus fashion, neither the battery or internal storage is easily upgraded. i paid something like $200 on super markdown for this, new. at that price, it's a stunning deal. out of the box, it will work with googlefi, as well. a few annoyances, but in balance a solid product .   perfect phone for a great sale price! glad i got it when it was only $250 .   works good after two months. amazing amoled 1440p display, with more screen real-estate than any other phone at this resolution. i made a full video review, click here for more.[ .  ]. at the sale price, the best phone i ever owned for the price .   2016, and this phone is truly amazing. got it instead of a 6p, and it's replacing an iphone 6 plus .   very unsure why this phone was discontinued as it is my favorite phone and one of the best price/performance you can get on the market right now. considered getting a galaxy s6 unlocked, but after doing some research decided to get this bad boy. at the time the galaxy s6 was $460 and the nexus 6 was $350. [ .  ] [ .  ] as you can see they both have very similar specs but the nexus 6 is almost a whole inch bigger in screen size. also this phone takes amazing photos and the 4k video recording is such an stunning feature. the 4k 6 inch screen is beautiful and great for watching videos on the go. the phone is very ergonomic and it just fits in my hand perfectly. i love how it's just the right amount of thin, but yes it has smashing curves baby! oooook .   anyway! the screen is huge, but definitely in a good way! i started out with a galaxy s4, switched to an iphone 5, and with the iphone 5 i really missed the big screen size, and i wanted that again with a new phone. if you are not a fan of large phones i suggest sticking with an iphone 5. i intend on sticking with this phone for years to come, or until the updates slow the phone down to where i have to get a new phone, which tends to happen with all models .   as the apps use more ram and battery, your phone becomes a slippery slope, this is how the cell companies make a killing off you long term. also not a conspiracy, progress also plays a part. any, you won't regret getting this phone .   great phone so far. works well with project fi. it's a big honker but love the size. love the fast charge feature .   at first i wondered how i could ever like a phone that was nearly as big as a small tablet. after some time i got used to it and i really like it. now when i pickup another phone that is smaller, it feels too small. there are many things i like about this phone. good sound. good camera - although my camera app stops working from time to time and has to be restarted. the screen is really quite nice, looks sharp and has good color. the phone is pretty zippy, and i don't often find myself waiting for things. for anyone on the fence, i would definitely recommend .   very goodï¼ï¼. i love this phone and will have a hard time replacing it when the time comes unless we get another nexus with a 6" screen. i can't imagine trying to use a phone with a smaller screen after owning this. had a problem with the volume down button becoming increasingly hard to press after about 6 months, so sent it for a replacement and got a new/refurbished one quickly. would definitely buy this again .   im so content with this phone. the best experience an android phone can deliver. what i like the most about it is the involving sound and the bright screen working together. difficult to ignore the battery behaviour: super fast charging and long lasting life. that camera is good too and everything else works just as expected. the only bad thing about this headset is that there's no accessories available around my magnificent location .   the best android phone so far! it is big, and that's good .   i love the nexus 6 that i had to buy another one. this phone is great for watching movies .   phones defective. phone will not update over the air .   i ordered this phone in november, but bought nexus wireless charger just now. and what i can see? phone won't connect to wireless charger. it's the poorest expirience i ever had with amazon .   my experience with the phone was very bad, because since i had the first time i found common defects that has the phone. my phone died on this day after leave loading at work where i always used to do, check the phone to see how much had loaded and turned on the screen, but then it was extinguished, and more never relit the screen or the phone either. from the beginning when the phone was downloading the volume he became uncontrolled and up and down. also after the first month the battery was a disaster. the phone was discharged in less than 4 hours of normal use. and worse, in this day loading as usual as i trailed off and not start or load or do anything. just hard me 4 months. i feel it's been my worst buy .   phone is okay, hence the 3 stars. yes it does give you a stock google experience and updates for latest os are fast, but the device is huge. the device is extremely wide and uncomfortable to use. great price after it was on sale, but similar devices can be purchased for around the same price with a better form factor .   best device ever! i love the screen, pure android experience, the smoothness of managing several applications open. unfortunately motorola is not producing nexus phones again :(. good work without problem and looking new. hate hate hate how they placed the power button and volume buttons all together near the right thumb area. often i turn off the display when trying to turn the volume up/down. sometimes i accidentally switch the phone off because the power button is right where i hold the phone. super annoying. otherwise a normal large/bit heavy android phone with great battery life .   best of android and unlocked what can you ask for more with all the high spec's. too big .   i typically get a new phone every 6 months or so, because i am never happy with what i have. i feel that for the price you pay for a phone, it should be able to do anything you need flawlessly. i have to say that this phone is one i will be using for a while. i never have to clear the apps out because it gets laggy. i have yet to have to recharge it during the day. it does everything i need it to. it gets all of the updated versions of android being a nexus, so you do not have to wait for the carriers to push it out with all of their bloat ware software that they put on it. you can also sign up for the android n preview and get the latest beta version of android with it. the quick charge is great. i can go from 0% charge to 70% charged in 20 minutes or so. the screen is incredibly clear. the speaker is plenty loud. both for phone calls, and other things like watching video. the wifi antenna has a great range and works with 2.4ghz or 5ghz. the screen is good quality glass as well. i have dropped this thing many times and haven't broke the screen yet. i even have a dent in the metal on the top of it and it still has not affected the usage. this phone has everything i need, and works great. i do not see needing to buy another phone for several years. if i do, it will be just because i want the new version of the nexus, and not because it messed up .   i love it so far, i have had a few glitches with it not being responsive to touch for a couple minutes and it running a little bit slow. overall i am enjoying it so far .   it really does not get much better than this! this phone was top of the line for any phone when it came out, and is pretty close to the same even today, years later. the screen is fantastic, the processor and ram are incredible, the battery is outstanding, the camera is great, the price is great, i guess the only downside to it is there is not a pocket big enough to hold it safe ;). good battery life. i get a whole day. before charging .   mobile looks really good however i don't know why it is generating excess heat. after less than 6 months the screen on the phone has become completely unresponsive, rendering the phone completely useless. i have a protective screen applied and a case around the edges. the return policy on this is terrible; i have been told that because it is over 30 days since i purchased the phone, i cannot return it or get a refund. i regret buying this completely .   really have no complaints with this phone at all. i bought this as a gift for a family member as i own the 64gb version of the phone since black friday. both models have been working fine. 4k video is amazing, photo quality also fantastic, and i don't find this phone to be too large at all as well as being perfect for a family member who finds it difficult to read small text with other phones. phone also uses new marshmallow android operating system which runs really smooth on this device. still not a fan of the photos app on android but a free app called myroll takes care of organization of pictures. it provides more value and flexibility than the iphone in my opinion. a few hundred dollars saved .   i upgraded to this phone after having a galaxy s5 for about two years. the s5 was a great phone, but i got frustrated with some stutters and slowdowns that would occur randomly. i purchased the nexus 6 since it has stock android and does not have any overlays that would slow it down. after having the phone for about 3 months, i can say that i am very impressed. the phone consistently performs well, the battery life lasts me over a day with moderate use, and the fast charging has come in handy more than once when i am low on battery. i would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a phone at a reasonable price point with great, even performance .   great phone. it upholds the nexus and the old motorola tradition. hope googlebit can keep them coming. and you can make calls with it .   cant beat the price i bought for around 250$. great phone. set up a breeze. there were a few numbers/contacts that didn't transfer, but not a huge deal. easy to use and takes awesome pictures and videos. i'm very happy with my purchase .   love this phone. it lasts long and has great specs. great phone all around. size of phone does take some adjustment. double front facing speakers are great! only downsides so far is battery life and lack of expandable storage .   great phone with reasonable price .   tl; dr: good phone for the price. not the best screen colors but good size and vanilla android has pros and cons. motorola did a good job with this phone. the screen is large and looks good. but i'm not a fan of amoled, or at least the motorola amoleds, to me, don't look as good. in low brightness the colors turn a yellowish hue. at max bright, it looks its best but this isn't practical in all situations. as for performance, it's great. multitasking is a positive experience and have few times had an app drop out of memory. call quality is good and it holds a good signal. depending on use, i can usually get a day on full charge. however if i use waze in the mornings and have music streaming during work (lte streaming) and playing through bluetooth i'll have to plug in during the drive home. a big plus is the screen size for watching netflix or hulu. the front facing speakers also help the experience. the speakers aren't particularly powerful but certainly better than most mobile phones. you have to be a fan of stock android and a fan of large screens to thoroughly enjoy this phone. manufacturers such as samsung or lg add some nice touches to android to make them stand out, such as split screen or floating windows. these can be useful and make the non stock android interesting. disadvantages of this are additional apps or features you don't want or use that eat up system resources. nexus phones offer a lighter, though more basic, android experience. true you can probably find an app to mimic some of the manufacturer features but these aren't always implemented well. but you will have a phone that runs quickly and receives newest android versions soon after release .   it too good,good price,good phone .   100% android, flawless, definitely recommend .   bought this during black friday to replace my aging s4. everything about it is better than the s4 except video recording. the nexus 6 has a horrible video camera. it cannot focus on moving objects. i like to take videos for instagram and this phone is absolute trash when it comes to videos. it constantly tries to focus and this leads to blurry videos. besides the video problem, the phone is great. longer battery life than the s4 and also much faster .   love it. this is a great phone. the screen is amazing. i had the nexus 4 as well, and the n6 seems more well built (although the n4 wasn't bad). i get great battery life, especially with android m. i haven't had any lag or reboot problems like i hear some people have with their samsungs and lgs. no bloatware on a phone is a beautiful thing. the camera is very good, especially for a phone that's a little older. the reception and call quality are stellar. my old phone used to struggle a little to get signal at my work, but this phone has no problems getting signal at all. i got the phone at a ridiculously low price, so i almost feel a little guilty getting so much for so little. as for screen size, i couldn't go with anything less than a 6 inch screen any more. the experience across the board is much improved on a bigger screen- typing, videos, browsing, you name it. because this phone has such small bezels, the size is very manageable and fits easily in all my pockets. i've never done much one-handed smartphone activity, so i can't really speak to that .   what are you waiting for .   just do it .   i love this phone. i love the size the minimalist apps and the fact that it gets software updates before any of the carrier phones. i wish it had an led notification light sometimes but have been ok without it. the battery life is good with moderate use if you keep track of battery stealing apps working in the background. this phone has been a perfect pairing with google's project fi .   love it. this one's a keeper. worth the money. will be a long time before this phone gets replaced. previous phone samsung galaxy s5 active. terrible. bloatware .   pure android, this phone is better than most newer models .   like the phone, like being out of contract with v even more .   this phone is awesome! hook it up with google fi and you can't go wrong .   the screen is to fragile it literally feel out of my hand about 2ft on to my dining room table and the screen shattered. back to using my old lg. i love this phone. such a great price for the quality of phone. the apps run fast and smooth. a lot of people don't really like the large screen but i think it is much better. it isn't as big and clunky as a tablet and not too small. i also love the screen resolution. better than retina on an iphone i think .   excellent. great phone .   this is a great phone best one i ever had. great phone. the perfect phone. is that a tablet in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? i'm not going to go all out with a bunch of details about this phone because i really just don't have the time, but i will say that the nexus 6 is one of the best phones of the past couple of years if you don't mind carrying a behemoth around in your pocket .   its very good,fast and with a big screen! i really like it .   it's a nice phone and it was on sale when i got it for $250 which is a great deal. i have occasionally had issues getting it to connect to the bluetooth in my car ( never had any issues with my other phones) but if i turn the phone off and back on it usually connects .   this review has been re-edited (10/14/2016) for updated information and greater clarity. i upgraded from a nexus 4 to this nexus 6, and i couldn't possibly be happier. this unit was described as used but in very good condition. so, the box itself was a bit beaten up, but once opened, the phone, charger, and cabling may as well have been brand new. there was no wear and tear at all. this is one of the best technology-related purchasing decisions i've made on amazon, and if i needed another phone, i'd do it again, from this seller, in a heartbeat. the nexus 6, being a "google phone", has thus far received every 5.x update that's come down the pike since it was introduced. it received the android 6 upgrade and every update that came out, and android 7 was released for it at the beginning of october 2016, and it runs fantastically. i use this phone with straight talk on the at&t network, and one has to be waaaaaaaay out in the sticks with basically no coverage for this phone not to have service. the battery life on this phone is, well .   "amazing" and "awesome" are thrown around so much these days that they don't mean very much, so let me put it this way. i leave the house in the morning between 2:30 and 3, generally get back between 12 and 3, and even with using gps and a bluetooth headset for audible, hands-free driving directions, some email checking, photo sending, texting .   when i get home, it's usually got somewhere between 50% and 60% battery charge remaining. one significant advantage, in my view, that this phone has over the successor nexus 6p model, is that it supports wireless charging. actually, it also supports turbo wireless charging. i bought aâ samsung ep-pg920ibugus wireless charging pad with 2a wall charger- black sapphire, and it works just fine. i really don't see much difference between corded and wireless charging times. an issue with the nexus 6 as a model is that, depending on how you have the volume set, notification sounds will sometimes be a bit glitched up (meaning, there's a distortion type sound for an instant at the beginning of the notification sound playback). it's obviously something in the design. however, with android 7, i have yet to notice that problem, so the one and only issue i could find with this phone seems to be resolved. all in all, i am totally satisfied with this phone .   camera stop working after 15 days of purchasing .   just i can say this is the best .   great phone for the price.i'm 5'10" and its not too big for my hand.it's faster better than iphone6 plus.i highly recommend it if you have budget around $270 .   exactly what i was hoping, the u.s. model brand new and arrived quickly .   thanks .   updated from a nexus 5. i'm in love! love the bigger screen too. even though it my not be for some. wireless charging is a big plus. i'm a couple of months in to it now and the phone is holding up well. no slowdowns to speak of. rocking it without a case as well and no issues to speak of. much prefer the white back over the blue back .   it's a bit bulky - a price i was willing to pay for what i paid. i don't like that the back is not flat. it doesn't sit on a q-charger very well (it does work). functionally it has been rock solid, charges quickly, keeps a charge well as long as you're using some of the battery saving feature. overall i'm glad i bought the phone (i replaced a samsung galaxy 5). i love that i own my phone and my phone company doesn't own me! that's my primary reason for purchasing an unlocked phone. i'm running it without issue on the verizon system .   when it comes to this bad boy the bigger the better. the larger phone is an adjustment at first. after galaxy phones and iphone i am stuck on my nexus. great phone .   the microphone stop working after two months  .   very disappointed .   love it .   specially the dual speakers, the sound it's very good .   couldn't be happier with this device. i received exactly what i expected, as advertised, and my device is fully functional and working without issue on verizon. anyone looking to get this device from amazon should be happy with their purchase. if you're on vzw, contact customer service and request the nano sim card (it is free) which is required for the network, and go about the normal activation process. just for reference, mine was purchased in january of 2016 .   love this phone! i feel like it's an appropriate upgrade and a great as a first time phablet if you previously used a nexus 5 like i have. much more powerful, crispy screen and improved hardware. people who are saying this is a large phone. it is. but i also believe people are overreacting. yes it's big, but if you're looking at this phone in the first place you aren't concerned about that, it's an overall great android experience. i also get lots of complements on this phone too, mostly from apple and samsung users! highly recommend .   i like this phone very much. though camera is poor. i like the form factor and sound quality. the nexus 6 debuted in 2014 but is still formidable in 2016. note that the screen and the phone are both very large. the design is thin, but with a 5.9" screen, it is a phablet by all measures. the software gets updated promptly, with monthly security updates straight from google. the android n developers edition has come out even when marshmallow hasn't been pushed for many other phones. if you are a hacker type, you can unlock the bootloader root your phone and install xposed modules very easily. i run the phone on t-mobile, and it supports band 12. very snappy, quick downloads. i'm a happy camper .   battery life could be better, i get about four hours of heavy active use (streaming), but this phone is a monster with its technical specs. normally i can go all day on one charge just navigating, talking, and surfing the web (no streaming). this phone already has a newer version and i don't even care that's how much i like this phone. i made the switch from apple to android and i could not of been happier, especially as an avid chrome supporter. front facing camera is just okay, the rear camera is excellent. the phone without a case looks rather sleek and sophisticated, however i have mine cased most of the time. works great as an unlocked phone both in the us, germany, italy, and france. love it, especially for the reduced price. very similar feel i think to a note, just not as good, but scales well for the price in my opinion .   love my phone. hate that there aren't many options out there for accessories. was thinking about an iphone or s5, but love that the screen on this is humongous. tons of storage room. it is really fast. camera is terrific. great buy for the money .   love the phone! i have been a nexus fan since the nexus 4, and year after year google keeps improving the nexus line! it is a little bigger for my taste, i am thinking on moving towards the nexus 5c but only because of the size .   really nice phone. i have it few months now, and i've got no complaints .   terrible design of hardware. locks up or powers itself off .   best phone i ever had, using it with project fi. not perfect, ring volume can be an issue sometimes. best to get a thin case for it that is not slippery cause this phone is big .   good. got on thanksgiving sale. love it! paid few hundred dollars less cause of sale. awesome :). this is the worst android phone i have ever owned. i paid full price for this phone thinking that it would be worth it. it is extremely slow. i have updated the phone every time it has an update available. it does not help. it still needs to reboot several times per day to even remain mildly usable. google screwed the pooch on this one. run .   loving it so far .   and marshmallows are awesome. very good. battery is going down faster. ok. this is a great price of equipment and is exceeding my expectations .   even it is out dated flatship it still silky smooth, i am very happy with the purchase. everything i through in there it runs perfectly .   love this phone. if motorola keeps making such products, will never go back to samsung .   bought this for my wife, who is a die-hard apple fan. great bang for the buck, with a big screen and 32g. she had had an occasional issue with opening the camera, but other than that is very satisfied. i appreciate the fact that it will get priority android updates. the only con we have found so far is that some apps are not up to date with the latest version of android. the screen is large and sharp and the sound is good (although still not excellent for listening to music). seriously, who can afford apple products anymore? there is a point of diminishing returns and we think the nexus 6 hits the sweet spot budget-wise .   excellent phone, powerhouse with stock os. it's big phone no doubt about it.and if you put case on it, it's even more tough to handle. the worst part about this phone is that it's thinner on lower part and thick at top. this is , at least for me, is big issue. soon after little use, you will feel pain in palm as naturally it's more weight is at top do it will try to incline back. i bought it on thanks giving and stopped using least week as i started having pain in wrist. finally bought nexus 5x. great phone. we bought 2 of these for my husband and myself. yes, it is big. it does take some getting used to. once you understand that this phone is big, adjusting for its large footprint, you will get used to it. it is very fast, the screen is vivid and clear especially with 4k video, the camera has performed fine. photos and videos come out crisp and clear. the storage is great and overall the best phone we have ever used. we went from a nexus 5 and an htc one. took a bit but this amazing phone was well worth the price we paid. have no complaints whatsoever. a super bargain at today's prices. less that half price of samsung flagship phones with comparable specs. if you can adjust to it's size, yes it is big, you will love this phone .   well at least it does not have carrier crap all over it. works well with sprint. got this for my sister and she loves it so far. she is very petite and is coming from the 1st gen moto x .  needless to say this is a huge jump in screen size but she couldn't be happier. :). this is truly a great phone. i had to send the device back to motorola for a replacement due to wifi and and cellular network connectivity issues, received replacement 3 weeks ago and is starting to do the same .   awesome phone,. excellent product, very recommendable. amazing phone, great camera, great phone at this price .   very good .   speaker is not working properly.to whome i have to contact? please suggest .   to havey. it is amazing mobile. phone worked fine .   this is a great phone. my only downer is its huge. i tried using it, but lugging this thing around is just to much. that being said, it fast, nice screen, and for the money, an excellent phone that performs as well as most any phone out there. i guess i would need a man purse to handle this thing on a daily basis .  just ordered a nexus 5x,. i liked the nexus 6 out of the box, and now i've owned this phone for 3 months. i'm amazed that i'm finding myself liking it more and more every day. getting used to its large footprint took a week or so, but now i wouldn't want to go back to a smaller phone. pros: - the 4k amoled display is absolutely stunning. not only are videos amazing to watch on it, but it's even a pleasure to type thousand-word google docs on it. staring at the display is that satisfying. - build quality: the phone feels tough and has a nice weight. it feels like you are holding a top-quality product. the curved back of the phone makes it feel secure in one hand (i do have very large hands though, an xxl glove size). - battery life: i use the phone heavily throughout most days, and on a typical day i never need to worry about battery life. - android's customization: i usually root my phones, but i haven't rooted my nexus 6 simply because i want to keep receiving updates. although i didn't root the phone, you can still do quite a bit of customization. i was not a fan of the default dpi setting (items were much too big on the screen for my taste). all you need is a pc to change the dpi to your liking. - great options for cases. - the loud, high quality front-facing stereo speakers are as awesome as you'd expect them to be. unless you're in a noisy place, you'll have all the volume you could ever want from a phone. cons: - i notice some very minor lag on some graphics intensive programs. it's actually become less noticeable the more i have gotten used to the phone. it's a speedy phone, just a bit surprising coming from my old galaxy s4 to see the nexus 6 be a hair less jumpy than the gs4 when running radarscope. - rooting is less desirable than other phones because you won't get the frequent nexus ota updates .   managed to get it at sales pricing. good buy for such an amazing phone with latest google os .   great phone at a great price .   i bought this device for my father to use on tmobile. as a guy who loves to play with any phone i can get in my hands, i had to figure out what this device feels like. it was strange. after 20 minutes of checking its camera, video, and just browsing the web, i felt like returning my galaxy s7 edge that arrived the same day and which i am planning to use with tmobile and ordering one more of these for myself. battery felt great. not replaceable, but during the same day i tested my new s7 edge, and nexus 6 seems to lose the power at the same rate. so i feel like these 2 devices would be equal in terms of hours of use. next, nexus 6 speakers. they are some of the best phone speakers i have heard. the sound is just amazing. i realized that i would love nexus 6 speakers instead of s7 edge bottom speaker which is nothing special. this device is worth all of the 350 dollars it sells on amazon right now. and there is no surprise it has such high rating on amazon. i passed on note five for the reason of not having both, replaceable battery and micro sd card. i dealt with limitations of storage, and now i only get phones with expandable storage. if you are ok with non replaceable battery and no sd card, getting note five instead would be a huge mistake .   i was so excited to get a phone with stock android marshmallow. sadly this phone has been nothing, but a huge disappointment. there are a few things about the phone i like, but all the misses offset those. first off, it's too big. i have had various samsung galaxy note phones, which were large, but not obscene. this phone is just absurd in size. the width is not an issue and fits comfortably in my hand, but it's too tall. it barely fits in my pockets, whether, jeans or a suit. good luck driving with it in your pocket, it is not comfortable at all. another huge flaw for me is the position of the power and volume rocker buttons. on the same side, small and too close together. the power button is textured, but once the phone goes in a case, it doesn't make a difference. the camera is also a huge disappointment. some reviews say it is decent, but every smart phone i have owned, takes better photos. also, where is my notification led? i have had a smart phone since about 2008, and remember every phone having a notification led. i know the phone technically has one, but i shouldn't have to root my phone for something so basic .   like new amazing phone only downside is the charger was a bit screwed up and the charging port loose but that's common when it comes to people who use their phones often so i can't really fault the seller for it. worth what i paid .   very good. excellent phone .   pro: huge amoled screen, speedy processor, plenty of ram and storage; pure android; rounded back is comfortable in the hand. cons: screen may be too big for some; a bit heavy; rounded back sucks on a table .   the best phone i've ever used. its fast smooth and takes great pictures. the screen in beautiful and bright. the battery has been lasting me all day with moderate use and the turbo charging is phenomenal. google makes great products and you can be assured that this is a great phone .   it is okay. second nexus 6 for our house. the 1st one was 3x this price. pleased with performance, screen size and battery life. screen is not as bright or sharp as it's samsung counterpart, but now that it's price has come down its a great value .   i was abit worried that the phone would be too big, and to be honest it is abit bigger than most phones but i can tell you that within 5 mins i got use to the size and i absolutely love my phone. the screen is big enough for everything and the speakers are awesome. i am happy i made the decision to get this instead of the nexus 5. i don't think i need a phone smaller than the nexus 6 right now .   awesome phone. no carrier bloatware. runs fast and smooth. tons of compliments. didn't take anytime to adjust to the large size. came from a galaxy s4, and this phone is like night and day. will add more after using for awhile .   for the price this is an amazing phone. it is super fast. gigantic screen which i actually love. wasn't to sure about the big screen but i dont think i can ever have another phone with a standard screen size. i have been using it with project fi and have been impressed to the service quality. i even get roaming which i did not get with net 10 .   excellent phone. upgraded from a 6 year old flip phone .   best phone. it froze for hours, and doesn't updatemotorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 64gb, midnight blue (u.s. warranty) (discontinued by manufacturer). fantastic phone! it looked brand new when i got it and it has been working perfectly since .   the nexus 6 is an amazing phone. completely customizeable in almost every possible way. being unlocked, you're not stuck in a contract with any of the big carriers. i originally used straight talk but switched to google fi, which is pretty amazing! the phone has a great forward facing camera and a reasonable self shot camera as well. the screen is large enough to watch videos with friends. the only downfall of the phone is that it is almost too big. while the size is great for some things it is a hindrance to carry around and near impossible to use one handed. i knew it would be big before i bought it, but i didn't realize exactly how big! i suggest playing with one before purchasing, but i still recommend this phone, i thoroughly enjoy mine .   quite simply the best smartphone ever made. i enjoy the phone .   still an awesome phone. with the marshmallow update the phone is even better than before .   got it at a great price and would buy it again. fast and meets all my expectations. fast, big and a nice screen. good camera .   excellent product .   however it doesn't support video to tv out the mini hdmi. :(. battery life sucks. crear phone .   good phone if you're getting a deal on it. i got mine refurbished from amazon for $250, a fantastic deal for a smartphone with the kind of specs this thing has. respectable cameras and vivid screen make it a good tool for capturing and seeing photos in the heat of a moment if you know the shortcut buttons. the screen is almost exactly 6" and there's no stylus, so this isn't quite as handy as a note 4/5, and at 6" with a shell case on it, this phone is a lot to handle. i have bigger hands and they just barely can work with this device. in all honesty 6" screens are too much, so i'll replace this device with maybe a note 4/5 since i've used a 4 and its 5.7" screen was much more comfortable for me when using one hand. but if the size isn't an issue and you're trying to keep costs down, there's a lot of power and good working features with the nexus 6. lastly, i'm not wowed by the battery life. if you get on this device and start using some more intensive apps, especially games, you're going to have a hard time getting good through most of the last the day. i try to minimize my battery draws and keep screen brightness on auto, but even then i'm lucky to get through a day. part of this is because the 2k resolution that the screen uses which draws more power. whoever thought this was a smart idea doesn't understand that content isn't optimized for anything beyond 1080p, and i'd gladly take that resolution over what the nexus 6 runs just to get an extra 10-15% battery life to get me consistent all-day usage. worthy of consideration for sure, just not quite everything i can ask for in a smartphone .   this phone is awesome. it's been only a month since i have it, but having been an iphone user all my life, i feel amazed of how easily this transition was. android has become a very intuitive user friendly platform. i can't believe it took me so long to finally change! i couldn't be happier for having jumped into the android pool with this phone. highly recommended .  so far .   i help friend to buy. he is very love it .   loved it. however, the screen can be a bit grayish when we go on low brightness and battery is not as good as it should be with extensive use it lasts just a day, well good thing there is turbo charging which charges in 45 mins. thirdly, if u want a outstanding camera, this is not a set for you. the camera is ok, not outclass. apart from the aforementioned things the set is perfect. as smooth as silk. actually bought 3 of these 64gbs, for myself and family. no problems so far .   in one word perfect phone. good phone. this phone lost connections where nexus 5 keeps. why does manufacture full us by wi-fi calling features? because of fail provide us by cell connection why does old nexus 5 keep lte connection for me? i could do wi-fi calls from ipod. btw it was xt1103. huge size is another story. remember, this huge size design is to impress everyone else, ie promotes this useless product after sale, it gives zero advantage to you. except permanent chances to slide to floor. this phone so huge, much huge than regular cup holder slot. i forgot it several times on right seat because it's neither located in pocket, not in cup holder. if you would try amazon kindle reader app, last chance to get advantage from big screen, you'll conclude how improperly power and volume buttons are grouped. could i advice this device? sure, try it for self-defense instead of brick .   love this phone, big at first get use to it. like new. the screen is great, super fast, love wireless charging, don't need it much huge battery with decent life for a days use (unless my nexus 5) .   great phone at an amazing price .   bought it for my in-law. he was extremely pleased .   i just purchased 2 months back and it stopped working suddenly.very dissapointed .   love this phone. no complaints .   i love this phone. no technical details as there are millions of reviews out there, but for given price, i am satisfied with this phone .   great device, i used it to join google's project fi, which offers excellent service, and some of the best customer support i have ever had .   honestly, i love the phone but sometimes the speaker volume is very low even when it's turned up. it happens even when i am in a very quiet place. also my battery does not last for 24 hours, it last for about 6-8 hours. otherwise, it charges super fast, takes great pictures and overall is very fast .   doesn't power up at all returned. works perfectly, no sign of cosmetic damage .   i've had it for two months now, well beyond the initial shock to its size. no doubt it's a massive phone, but i'm not sure i could get a smaller one after getting used to this now. the extra screen real estate makes the phone useful as an every day replacement for basic tasks you used to do on a computer. riding the train every day while reading news, watching videos and listening to music and i am still able to get through more than 1 day on a single charge. the turbo charging is also helpful as well .   excellent! good price and fully functional .   it fell into ground in the first week and its screen is broken .   for a used phone, it was great. some of the features were still working. i just noticed a few deficiencies .   work good no problem yet. nice big phone. affordable. picture quality is okay .   good. paid 283 including tax for 64gb version. was listed as used- very good, box damaged. arrived with a smudge mark on the back which i cannot erase and the box was all taped up with packaging tape. no other issues. i love the phone and would recommend it .   this is a gigantic phone, i won't lie to you. it will fit in most pockets leaving no room to spare. i had a hard time deciding if i wanted to use this as a phone or a tablet, the front facing stereo speakers are second to none. there's a lot to like about this phone, but the one thing i did not was battery life, i just couldn't get a full day of use out of it, as compared to the iphone 6s+ or galaxy note 4, which is ridiculous because of how big it is.in the end i returned it, which was a breeze with amazon .   love it. i hated the 4 , but this one , so far is great . let see after a year , that's the real test  .   very nice,i love it. this is the greatest cell phone value available! i love the nexus 6 because it works on any carrier. i have verizon, and i've had no problems on their network. the nexus 6 gets all the google security updates and other software updates faster than any other phone because they don't have to be tested by the carrier. it frustrates me to buy a new phone, and it's not running the latest software out of the box. then, there is no timetable for updating. maybe it will happen. maybe it won't. additionally, it's made by motorola, my favorite manufacturer. i love their ability to say, "ok google," and wake my phone without touching it. once your able to lay down and say, "wake me up in two hours," you'll never go back. quick charge is another feature that has changed how i use my phone. no longer am i plugging in my phone at every opportunity. i use my phone whenever and wherever i want. when my phone gets below 30%, i charge it at my first chance. i can get three hours of screen time and still have at least 30% battery. within 30 minutes, i have enough battery to usually make it back home. i'm satisfied with quick charge 2.0 on the nexus 6. quick charge 3.0 should be amazing on upcoming devices. lastly, the phone does all i need. no performance hiccups. the screen is huge. i can comfortably see it in any light with little to no adjustment. i'll have a hard time with anything smaller after this beast. at current prices, i don't know why anyone wouldn't want one. they're great devices that probably exceed the needs of an overwhelming majority of smartphone users. why pay +$600 at once, over 24 months, or be locked in a contract? buy this, get insurance, keep more of your money, and change your phone whenever you're ready. it's really a no brainer .   phone quit after 2 months. motorola customer service has been a nightmare! will be without a phone for 2-3 weeks. as soon as i get this replaced i'm trading it in on something better. i will never buy a motorola again .   i love this phone, but first phone like this i ever owned. i have problems with bluetooth sound going to max volume. change to different bluetooth head set. problem solved for now. screen sometimes splits on recovery from sleep. turn screen off and on again and full screen is back .   best phone i've ever owned. huge 2k screen. great sound. all the latest android updates. can't go wrong with the nexus 6 .   display is damaged,whom to contact now .   very bad camera .   good product with best packing .   excellent product and price. google fi works great with this phone. glad i chose the nexus 6 phone. excellent phone, but ever since the marshmallow update the battery isn't as great .   ok. i have many nexus products. i think they are the best .   top phone. had this phone for a while now and it's great. huge, beautiful screen and stock android, which i love. excellent build quality but what else would you expect from motorola .   love the phone. it's a beast! don't need to spend $$$ on newer phones how fast of a phone do you really need .   a great portable computer that makes calls too! i can see it .   simply said, this phone rocks! it's the best android phone i've ever purchased and i even use project-fi for my provider. i bought this phone so i could switch from verizon to project-fi and i'm so glad i did that. project-fi has the best setup, they're more than fair and honest with their customers, and their customer service and phone plans absolutely blow the rest of them out of the water .   very good. i love it .   absolutely amazing, especially for that price (i got it for 349$ on november 2015). it is a bit big, but you get pretty used to it, and again, for that price there is just no comparison .   itâ€˜s looks very nice ï¼œbut how make it works in cdma 3g net in china .   i absolutely love this phone, i love motorola products. pros: price has dropped huge long battery life wireless charging fast durable quick charger cons: build quality was a little cheap no finger print reader my back lifted a little, manufacturer defect poor customer service. i have had it for one week and it has met all my expectations. great processing speed and can multitask very well. it's very user friendly and intuitive. have this connected to google project fi (utilizes tmobile, sprint, or wifi whichever is strongest) and my monthly bills are estimated to be between $25-35 total for each month. the savings on the phone bill alone will cover the cost of this phone in a year when compared to being on a major network .   just an awesome phone. if you want a big phone for a great price, this is a good one. runs android 6.0 without a hitch allowing for all day battery life. google and motorola really did a great job with this phone .   love my phone :) .   pros: unlocked bootloader. bright screen. high resolution. fast cpu makes for smooth operation. lots of ram for apps and storage. made by motorola (a personal preference thing, i know). cons: case is just a bit too large and just a bit too slippery. i haven't yet dropped it, but i constantly worry that i will. battery capacity doesn't measure up to the droid maxx it replaces. available battery cases all seem to be garbage. as of this writing, has a very limited selection of rom's available .   bought to use as a google fi phone. moved from republic wireless and not disappointed .   my review is not good purchased this phone a little over a month and i am having some issues with it one day after removing from the charger it didn't wouldn't restart til about 30 minute it get warm while charging it says the manufacture discontinued this phone when and why. excellent phone, visually impressive and better performance. 100% recommended. i replaced our nexus 5 with the nexus 6. really like the phone. it is much bigger than i expected. large phones seems to be the trend now .   i absolutely love this phone. the screen is huge and the colors are just gorgeous. the pictures this phone can take are top notch ( i'm speaking as a semi-professional photographer). i find everything very easy to use and access. the battery life is excellent - we're talking you can easily go 24 hours before you need to charge it. and it's a very tough phone. it can withstand quite a bit of wear and tear. i do not recommend dropping it face down on a concrete floor as that will shatter the glass screen. i did that to my first nexus 6. the screen smashed but the phone still worked; hoping to get it fixed and keep as a back-up phone. i'm on my second nexus 6 because i loved the first one so much that i had to have another one .   i bought this when i got my project fi set up, and i was ready to go. it worked right out of the box! the best part is--after i rooted the phone and added a custom rom, then had to go back to unrooted with a stock rom, i managed to 'brick' the phone. three weeks in and i had a $300 doorstop. i called motorola support, explained that i was an idiot, and they did an rma and sent me a brand new phone--no cost. the phone is huge! the amoled screen is gorgeous, and the speed is ridiculous. plenty of storage for me, as i don't do much with mp3s. i stream amazon or pandora, and it does those really well. take the time to learn the features, as a lot of the coolest things on here aren't normally utilized. dig around and find settings. don't just grab and go .   exactly what i wanted in a phone with great price point. my concern is i have t-mobile and i cannot upgrade my software. it freezes and reads error codes and does not read sim. please advise i would like it give a higher rating if you can help me resolve this issue. fyi i'm local in northern california where this item was shipped so i can go into your shop if needed be. good product and fast shipping. after 2 amazing years with my nexus 5 it was utterly destroyed. lucky for me amazon had a great price on the nexus 6. it's been amazing. the screen is huge. honestly i like the size, web pages are a pleasure to view, and use. i loved the battery life on my previous nexus, but this phone is amazing, after a full day in my basement clinic at a hospital i still had 70%, even after moderate use. the screen is bright even at 50% brightness or less. the phone feels amazing in hand. i don't think you could ever go wrong with nexus devices .   this was my first nexus purchase, and it was a good one. i would have bought other nexus phones before but i have verizon and the only other nexus they ever supported was the galaxy nexus (and we all know how that went). i love the performance of this phone. even for late 2014 hardware, it still excels in early 2016. android 6.0 marshmallow is fast, clean and efficient. while i do love this phone, i don't use it as my daily driver for 2 main reasons. 1 - the size. yes the most common gripe with this phone is the size. now to me it's not really that bad, but i can't always two hand it. i don't mind using two hands, but when i'm at work, or setting up music in my car, it isn't very one hand friendly. 2 - cases. because of my work (and already experiencing a spider crack before) i prefer to use a durable case (which also doesn't help the size issue). i always go with the otterbox defender but oddly they didn't make one for the nexus 6. so no lifeproof or otterbox cases left me with the ballistic case. the case isn't bad, but to me, it dampens the overall experience of the phone. overall though it is a good phone with a lot to offer. i definitely recommend this phone, you know, as long as size isn't a big deal of course .   great phone at a good price, just be careful with the screen it will break pretty easy. great phone. people complain about the size, but size w/ quality is what i was seeking. as for android phones, i rank it among the top of the line. oh, if you have small hands then sorry .   amazing phone for under $400 .   i bought one for myself, which works perfectly. love the big vivid screen and the phone works very fast. then i bought one for my father and i've had to return it twice. first day out of the box after updating the operating system to android 5.1.1 on t-mobile, the phone gets stuck on optimizing apps and crashes. restarting only repeats the process and eventually an error message says "no sim." factory reset did not fix problem. giving up and trying a different phone. very disappointing .   outstanding value. a little too big and the camera is not as good as the s5 it replaced. however, i love the clean os .   i got if for my wife during the black friday 200$ dollar sale. it's super fast, has a really good screen and android upgrades easy. the one knock on this phone has been it's huge size, but that's exactly what my wife wanted because she doesn't like tablets. so she wanted something this size. she's happy. i'm happy. hopefully you're happy too .   great phone all around for great price. not a big deal but it is a bit too big. very bulky in the pocket .   typing on this phone right now for this review. battery is good unless you are a power user. all phones will drain faster if you play graphic extensive games on it. it will last 2.5hrs to 3hrs when i play games like i said. it is snappy. i like the simple android m. does take a while to boot up from start. resets are faster. you will run a few updates before you get the android m updates .   great price for a seemingly excellent phone thus far .   good item. i love it, more cost effective than samsung galaxy series. nexus 6 is an awesome phone! my previous phone was a htc one ($650+, unlocked), which was rated the best phone in the world by techradar when i bought it in 2013. so when i dropped the htc and the screen cracked, i was looking for upgrade. at $299 (from amazon), the nexus 6 seemed to be a huge downgrade. but not after a few months of using it. i love this phone. it does everything that a high-end android smartphone is supposed to do - in the same manner it is supposed to do it (no sluggishness). what this phone does better than almost everyone else is: this guy has a huge screen. a few months with this phone and i realized, i have reduced my tablet usage a lot. i read all my news on the phone, watch youtube on the phone and so on. and it is not one bit uncomfortable on my hand (i am medium built). even at the currently listed price ($349 for 32 gb), i think this phone is a bargain .   phone arrived quickly and was packaged very well. the phone was exactly as described and included a spigen bonus case and a screen protector. have used it for several weeks. very satisfied with my purchase .   love it .   this phone sucks, period .   it's a good mobile,but it's shortcoming is also obvious:1.endurance time is very short.2.system becomes slower and slower after several weeks.3.camera is not good enough as expected .   good~. i would love this phone if the amoled screen was much brighter and cooler and the colors had more saturation and if it had a knock on option. the stock android experience makes this phone completely customizable but i didn't download any launchers or icons making it truly authentic android. the speakers are outstanding .   the best phone i ever used. very fast web browsing, excellent stereo sound .   i got a good deal on the phone so i'm happy about that. battery is eh and the charger block is not working after 2 months .   camera is meh. wireless charging is nice. speed was ok. no expandability. water resistance is a nice perk. video broke in 7 days after using the turbocharger. got a moto x pure, and am much happier .   upgraded from nexus 4. not a fan of the phablet, but can't complain for $200. colors look red when brightness is low. nice speakers. like the auto wake function .   i got this to use with my tracfone service. i love it! it has been fantastic so far. it is larger than a normal cell phone. but that doesn't bother me at all. the teeny tiny cellphones were really starting to irritate me; my big fingers hit 3 keys, etc. ok, not exactly that bad, but annoying enough. i can download a lot of apps, songs, etc. the battery life is great to. i listen to music all day at work (i download amazon playlists and listen to them offline not using wifi or internet) and the drainage on the battery is only about 50 to 65%. still plenty of juice for the rest of the evening before charging it back up later. i am not a big talker, but will send several texts, check facebook, etc. through the day. again, i love it .   i love this phone it is the best phone i have owned so far. it is big so you have to watch out when buying accessories to be sure it will fit. otherwise no problems .   a pure android phone .   no complaints software wise .   the screen is big .   one will have a tough time going to other brands after getting used to this .   speakers are loudest i heard in phones .   google/motorola designed an almost perfect phone .   the phone is big .   forget about fitting it in regular stands/slots etc .   camera is the only disappointment  .   camera is below average .   wish it were better .   best phone i have ever had in my hands. it's as big as a bus, lightning fast and works flawlessly. i installed the "pure nexus" (which is the latest is 6.01, marshmallow) custom rom on it, immediately after i unlocked the boot loader and put the custom twrp recovery. 4g data, hotspot and every other feature work perfectly and it has zero carrier bloat\junk\crapware. mine came in a white box with only a micro-usb cable and a wall wart. it's in mint condition .   my fiance loves this phone. it was in good condition and arrived 1 day early. seems to work as expected, no problems so far. happy with the purchase .   works as expected with google fi. best phone i have owned. regular updates and none of the bloatware that other manufacturers include .   great phone. really good excellent deal .   this is a very nice cellphone, i love it! thanks very much .   just what i wanted great seller thanks. the nexus 6 is a great phone. i purchased this to replace my htc one max on verizon. needed a different size sim card, but the verizon store was very helpful to provide me with one. the fact that it runs stock android is one of the main reasons i ordered this device. it is updated far more frequently than my previous devices and doesn't have near as much (if any) bloatware. the preloaded apps can all be removed without too much trouble. google also provides factory images that can be flashed to upgrade/reset the device in addition to over the air updates .   the phone has repeated heating problems and hangs up. when sold at discounted price, should think twice. with lot of sellers and thru an online marketplace, no one owns the responsibilty. no clarity on warranty. thumbs down .   what can i say. it's a great phone without any hiccups. perfect for my hands. pure android experience. works great. battery is great. very fluid. no lag. the beauty of android platform is that you have so many choices within few years that you can buy a new gadget or device when ever you feel like .   love it period .   phones big but i love it .   baby good, the next time will be selected, and hope that the cheaper .   one of the best phone i had get. and by 200 dls you can beat it. in love with this phone. can't believe it's 2 years since it came out. current phones have less specs than this one .   nice phone with latest android. good size screen and good battery life. great phone. works perfectly with at&t go phone .   i can't say enough good things about this phone. i'm glad i got it, and i would buy it again .   refurbished by motorola, you couldn't find a flaw on it. the only con was the cheap, 1 amp charger that came with it, which was remedied easily. my brother has an old nexus that he has to keep hooked to a battery charger and still runs out of juice all the time. i almost swear it runs on air! i use it instead of the subscription navtech system on my lexus. my brother, the tech wiz who put me on to it, is jealous as hell. i have not used the camera or video yet but i doubt i'll be disappointed .   warning this is a big phone, dwarfs all others in comparison. great display, great for media consumption, and great as a gps. battery life could be better but overall great phone. also watch out for screen burn in is actually happens on this phone. i have both nexus phones, this one and 6p, will sell the 6p! why? dont know why they made it so tall, the camera is better on the p but nothing else i could think of! plus, i paid this baby 250 .   great phone. super fast. great 6 inch display with very vivid colours. sturdy. very loud speaker. everything i wanted in a phone .   i have enjoyed the nexus 6 so far. i have not had any issues with the hardware or software. without a case it has survived a few drops. would recommend to a friend looking for a new phone .   this is a great device. works perfect on att. after configuring the device to limit background tasks i now get about two days battery life. the phone is a bit larger than i was used to but now that i have used it for a while it's not a problem. i recommend this phone .   blah blah blah great phone but not even close to what's being advertised here. i was so excited about it until i realized mine came boot loader locked and tied to att as carrier (i.e. no use of hotspot or screen cast) this sucks since i use straight talk and also because you can get this same phone tied to a carrier for about 180.00$. i felt ripped off and lied to. thanks for nothing, another return to amazon. just fyi lying about your product does not satisfy customers .   excellent product. once again pure android from google delivers fast, smooth and efficient phones, this time in phablet size .   love the phone and no att crap preinstalled .   great phone. i've had this smartphone since november 2015 and it has been a wonderful experience! i've had many different smartphones over the years from many different manufacturers. with each i found myself liking them but wishing for some performance that they were incapable of or required me to make modifications. not so with the nexus 6. out of the box it has been spot on for all my smartphone needs. i wish i could have gotten it at today's prices as it is an even better deal than when i purchased it. while you may find other phones that will have some tech specs better than the nexus 6, none of them will give any better a user experience than the nexus 6 will give you. so if you are looking for best value and best user experience from a phablet class phone then dollar for dollar nothing compares .   excellent cellphone. i can pay for this again .   so coool. nice case, good price. got lucky and picked up this nexus 6 on sale for $249.99 on amazon special. for that price, this is a lot of phone. pure android with all the usual motorola software goodies. battery life easily lasts me a whole day, occasionally forgetting to plug it in at night and giving it an hour on the rapid charger before work. good enough for my needs! coming from a moto g 1st gen.i was in need of a performance boost, but didn't want a giant phablet as they tend to stab me in the waist when i sit down on my motorcycle. i bit the bait and opted for the monster size phone, even after returning an asus zenfone 2 for being too large. seeing as i have to rdp and ssh into various stuff for work, i felt the larger screen could benefit me there. it's been fantastic for that kind of use, and although the nexus 6 is just a bit large for one handed use, it's wider than my asus zenfone 2 and not as long, so a little less motorcycle stab at my waist. i paired this with a slimarmor case that looks great and has a cheap kickstand that is insanely functional. there's a hole cutout on the back for the m, and it actually doubles as an anchor point for a finger during one handed use. other than that, audio and display are both excellent, performance is snappy and the stock android makes it a perfect phone for my needs .   i works well .   it's a great phone, i love it. wonderful phone. this phone is the phone you want if you want a true android experience .   i have no gripes about this phone. battery life is good. phone is very fast, and has a very beautiful screen .   about the only thing wrong with this nexus 6 32gb, is that it isn't a 64gb model! the size is perfect for watching media content, and even the occasional typing. the phone is very snappy and responsive, and a huge upgrade over my galaxy note 2. the battery life is impressively long, and will most times go 2 days before needing to be charged. i get approximately 10 emails per hour all day long, and i'm surprised that the phone still has more than 70% batt after a full day of medium use. the included fast charger can usually get me back up to 100% in about 30-40 mins, from 10-15% .   i do have my screen brightness turned almost all the way down (about 10%) to achieve these results. which is ok, since i rarely use it outside in daylight. in daylight, i've had to resort to turning the brightness up to about 20-25%. also at rest, the phone powers itself down into a "deep sleep" state, which helps it maintain long batt life. the screen is huge .   and beautiful, and even with a screen protector, is one of the best screens i've seen. the quad hd resolution is a thing to behold. hd videos come to life on this phone .  can't wait for good 4k content. the most useful feature i like is that when a notification pops up, or i pick up the phone, the screen automatically turns on for about 3 seconds, and you don't have to push the power button. i use the phone clad in an armoured case, and pushing the side buttons take a little bit of a squeeze. the keyboard & touch response is a perfect 10, with very little lag, prolly attributable to the fact that there isn't a lot of bloatware running all the damn time! the phone shipped with lollipop(5.0), but i'm already upgraded to 6.0.1, and loving the fact that i don't have to wait for android upgrades. the only reason this phone (i should have bought 2 at the $250 sale price .  ) doe not get a perfect score from me is that i know the 6p is out there! from what i've read and reviews i've watched if you don't mind spending that kind of money, go for it .   must root/rom to make a lot of features work, such as otg. really good, beso phone for this price. nice phone .   so far so good! ðÿ˜‰. excelent .   amazing devices. very much like the phone. great battery, gets android updates before anyone else, what else do you need .   the nexus 6 is a "hoooooooooge" phone. when i first received it, i thought that i would never get used to the size. however, after a few weeks, i did not notice the size; it has a 5.96" screen. in fact, when i went back to look at my nexus 5, the screen on the nexus 5 looked so tiny. if you buy a case, you can place a driver's license, credit cards, and some cash for emergencies in it. this eliminates the need to carry a wallet, so total space used in your pockets is less than a phone + a wallet. the sound is amazing for a phone; it has 2 front-firing speakers. it actually sounds slightly better than the speakers on my nexus 9 tablet. my friends in singapore were amazed at the sound (they are all apple fanatics). the battery life is fine; the phone comes with a 3,220 mah battery, which lasts me all day. it comes with a turbo charger, which is extremely handy when you are traveling. the screen is a 5.96" amoled, 1440x2560, 16:9 aspect ratio, 493 ppi, corning gorilla glass 3. it is clear enough to read the news (i am a news-aholic), but i would not want to read a novel. a big advantage of a nexus phone/tablet is getting faster updates with no bloatware installed. however, when i first received the phone the os was lollipop, which i found to be unstable and it stuttered occasionally. now that i have been upgraded to marshmallow 6.0.1, it seems significantly more stable. however, i did find out that google-store purchased phones and tablets get android os updates first. google, amazon, motorola, and at&t all pointed the finger at each other as to who is responsible for distributing the updates. i found this circus to be annoying, not customer-oriented, and a surprise since i have purchased the nexus 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9 from amazon and google in the past and was never informed of this priority distribution. my greatest disappointment was the camera. my nexus 5 seemed to take better photos. i am hoping that future software updates will resolve this issue for the nexus 6. overall, the phone is an excellent phone for the price .   once you get used to the size. it is also eligible for googlefi, which is a great plan for both domestic and international use .   not so great battery life, screen is not so great but overall good phone .   order arrived on time. product is great. no issues with my phone currently and would recommend anyone to get this phone .   update - 3/23/16 - after less then 3 months of use, the battery became defective or corrupted. the phone got alarmingly hot after less than 10 mins of continuous use, remains scary hot while charging (turned off phone to charge), and battery lasted less than 3 hours after a full use. thank god for amazon awesome customer service. i sort of loss faith in the quality of the nexus line after this, though my nexus 5 still works fine. overall happy with phone after six weeks of heavy usage. major pluses are big amoled screen and getting os patches asap from google (samsung, htc, lenovo, etc can take months-yrs to get os updates out to each of their models). serious negatives are short battery life even when my screen brightness is always at minimum, i don't let mail apps auto refresh or push, and i don't watch videos. you'll be lucky to get to 5pm from fully charged at 7am :/. the other negative is that phone will get disturbingly hot after ten minutes of any serious gaming - barely fought five 1-2 minutes fights in mortal kombat x and the phone is scary hot :/ but since i do minimal mkx gaming on this phone, it's good for the value paid .   great for the $200 pricetag .   this is a fantastic phone that i use as my "main computer" since i live in a country with no fixed broadband and i do everything on my cellphone rather than a laptop/desktop. this was an upgrade from an lg g2 that i had to return after a few weeks because the touchscreen wasn't working properly/android was crashing regularly. - great screen. i was a bit scared initially that it would be too big but now i feel like i cannot go back to a smaller size. it is obviously a bit harder to maneuver with one hand only but overall it makes everything else, from browsing the web, to reading spreadsheets or watching movies much easier. - zipping fast and can handle heavy multi tasking. even with two dozens of pages/apps opened there is no slow-down/glitch - no crap/overlay over android as you get from other manufacturer - solid battery life - you go throughout the day without a pb - good at managing things like attaching documents to emails/reading spreadsheets or ppt. it really is a laptop in your hand. you can even edit spreadsheets if really needed after two months of use i am 99% satisfied of the phone. one minor issue i have had so far is that google fit stopped working .  bit annoying but not exactly a deal breaker .   love this phone. only wish it had an ir blaster, notification light, and touch to wake .   depending upon the price you pay for this phone (it has fluctuated by a good amount in the last 2 months), this is one of the best values on the market. quick rundown: -the qhd screen has decent brightness and color reproduction (although it has a noticeable pink hue below 33% brightness). -the battery life is sufficient enough that i don't miss having a removable battery, and the charging is quick as well (less than 90 minutes to full charge, less than 15 mins for 25%). it makes it through of a full day of moderate use with battery to spare. i've tested it by streaming music over lte via bluetooth to my car on a five hour road trip while also using google maps' navigation, and the phone didn't even hit 50%! -the dual front facing speakers are impressive, rivaling some of the best phone speakers i've heard. -after experiencing stock android, its impossible to go back. i've rooted and installed custom roms on my last 4 phones, but there's almost no reason to with this phone. everything is smooth as butter, and you get ota updates within days of google posting them. -reception is great, call quality too. supports volte and wifi, the latter of which is especially useful if the reception in your home or office isn't great. -i haven't used the camera enough to thoroughly rate it, but it does seem to be the weakest link in this phone. the pictures i've taken are more grainy, less focused, and duller in color than my previous two phones. if you take lots of pictures in varying conditions and want the best quality, that might be the deal-breaker for you. it wasn't for me. all in all, this phone rivals current flagship phones in most areas. yet depending upon the discount you get, it can be 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost. i highly recommend this phone .   amazing phone is a beast. works in venezuela 3g, 4g lte digitel, movistar, movilnet .   i had problems with the camera of nexus 6 and little responsailidad by motorolla as they leave much to be desired, is this the main reason that apple is the best option of buying a mobile, whether you like who likes service customer is to follow suit. if you can buy a much better apple and it will cob s atener no problem the customer service, also said that samsung is unfortunate. a greeting .   simply best phone for the price paid. just lack finger print sensor. everything else works great .   great for its price. fantastic phone in a fantastic price .   really liked this over the 6p because it was a little bigger, but unfortunately it would not work with good for enterprise so i had to go with the 6p .   amazing fast even in late 2015. as expected. love it .   it's simply a great great phone, the quality and the price are a really god match. i really recommend that you install other launcher once you buy it. and also you have to keep in mind that it doesn't come with headphones. it's a beautiful and powerful phone for everyday use; android 6.0 update gives it the edge compared to other phones i've used .   its very nice cell phone i found more than i expected. the phone is wonderful and is what i dream of. but the good: beautiful screen and boy is it bright i love it and it's huge good display. wish it had 4gb ram but 3 will half to do. i love the phone size of thought i'd be uncomfortable but he'll i like it. cons: before android updates my phone battery life sucks really bad. but after i did all the upgrades it last alot longer still not good as it advertised. the spaces i hoped for was 32gigs but it shows 28gb maximum guess system memory took the rest. it's also kind of twitchy here and their but got better after the update. i'm happy i got this phone. 4stars for how good it is .   first phone was a lemon. screen separated from back of the phone, and the proximity sensor wouldn't allow me to access the keypad during calls to access voicemail or select 1 for english during automated calls. motorola exchanged under warranty, and new phone works perfectly. wish it hadn't been a hassle .   great phone .   excellent. this phone is truly worth every penny spent .   picked up the 32gb version of this phone after the price drop. out of the box, it's a fantastic device. it's a nexus, so you're always gonna be first in line for updates. build quality is excellent. rooting takes this phone to another level. the lack of sd card support is a fair criticism of this device, however. personally, i'm no where near my storage limit, though the lack of sd does make twrp backups a bit of an issue. i just store my twrp backups on a flash drive. that way if the device gets wiped, i can just reinstall twrp and restore from the flash drive. if you've never owned a nexus device, i highly recommend grabbing one of these up while you still can .   great phone, large screen. not for single hand typing .   loooooove it so much .   so far so good. one drawback: the power button is too close to the volume button thus i have to look at the buttons when adjusting volume to avoid accidental powering off .   great device! fast, smart, huge screen. a+. excellent phone, all that you think it is and more. it's a bit large, but easy to read, huge on memory, fast as hell, and the most impressive phablet i have used. highly recommended .   great phone but arrived more beat up than expected. i would not consider it "good condition." also it had been rooted so i could not get any system updates .   amazing deal! i own both the nexus 6 and 6p andbthe nexus6 almost matches nexus 6p in everything .   bought 3 devices. we all like it very much .   the unit doesn't appear to be completely new to me as the plastic sheet that covers the screen doesn't stick to the screen nicely like it's coming from the factory first hand. it looks like someone has taken out the screen protector and stick it back in again. why did that happen when i have ordered a new unit? and there are scratches on the back of the unit as well .   no removable battery or expandable storage are the only two down-sides to this phone. everything else is great. stock android is quite lackluster, but fortunately rooting the phone and putting whatever rom you want on it is super easy. :). way better than my note 4 .   extremely happy with my nexus 6. has exceededâ€‹ all expectations .   is not what i was expecting. as expected .   fantastic upgrade from my htc one m8. i never thought i'd want a "phablet," but after using this, i can't go back! the screen is great - easy to see in direct sunlight. i'm glad they went with front facing speakers also, that was a huge selling point for the m8. i highly recommend rooting this phone (that's what a nexus is for, right?) and installing a custom rom and kernel. my battery life is fantastic. i can easily make it through the day with gps, wifi, and nfc on, while paired to my smartwatch .   powerful smartphone awesome screen tuff build not for crybaby a real great tool n mobile entertainment center *** on sale makes it even better *****. phone was as advertised, fast shipping. would do business again, thanks. camera, for apps like snapchat, are awful. but the actual camera app itself is good quality. the google launcher can be annoying, but there are other launchers you can download in the play store that people often prefer using. "google now" can be a big help. battery life lasts long if you don't use your phone. other wise it lasts 3-4 hours which was a disappointment. the charger is pretty quick in charging the battery, a plus. screen resolution is great. good memory space. love the look of the phone. definitely should buy a case; the phone design is made to break easily, especially when you open the packaging be careful. the phone has frozen once on me after days of having it on continuously. but since then it has been working top notch. it's a fantastic phone considering the key components -- memory space, brand name, and price. cannot find a better phone that includes what the nexus 6 has. i've tried other lesser name brands like blu products, as well as big name brands like samsung. nexus is a close second to galaxy but half the cost. if you're more of an iphone person, stick to iphone. there's good and bad about apple products just like android, and i've used both. android's fit more of my needs. depending on the future models of the nexus, and if their camera improves drastically, i will definitely be considering purchasing one again .   love this phone. after 5 inch galaxy s4 - this phone is superior fast, as a speed of light :) but, sadly, i didn't take into account it's 6" of screen and thick body, so used it only for 2 days, and after sold it to co-worker .   brought as advertised. this was my second nexus .   it works great. i am very happy with my nexus 6. i bought the 32 gb version and it has worked perfectly. my phone service is provided by consumer cellular and within a couple days of setting up my service, android was updated to m (6.0.1). initially, i had a problem with the speaker and volume being too low, but after researching the problem for a couple days i discovered that it was necessary to remove the plastic screen protector that comes with the phone. once i did that and figured out how to adjust the volume it has been terrific. my previous phone was a samsung captivate glide that was very good, but just too small. i am slowly learning to use all the features of this great phone and look forward to using it for many years to come. battery life has been fantastic compared to the captivate glide .   this is by far the best android phone i've ever had. great screen, awesome camera , phone is fast and responsive always. pure google experience is amazing .   i bought this phone to replace my two-year-oldâ€‹ nexus 5. the nexus 5 has been a great phone and that's why i decided to give the nexus 6 a shot. the first thing i noticed about this phone was that it is huge. the screen is an inch larger than my nexus 5 and i didn't think it would be that big of a difference but its like night and day. at first, i was worried that the phone would be too big but its actually one of the best features of the phone. i feel like the size of the phone makes typing easier with less mistakes when compared to the smaller keyboard i was using before. battery life so far seems to be great, i left my phone on overnight and woke up with 88% of the battery still available. it sure beats having to be tied to a power outlet multiple times a day to get my phone through the day. i am using this phone on the tmobile network and with band 12 (my old phone didn't have it) i get signal in places where i wouldn't with my old phone. i'm sure this helps with the extended battery life since its not searching for signal all the time. another huge reason why i wanted to stick with the nexus is because it is pure android. it doesnt come with all the extra crap software that other companies put on their phones. i believe this is one of the reasons why these phones hold up and continue to perform well over time. the nexus phones also get the newest versions of android before the other flagship phones do .   motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 64gb, midnight blue (u.s. warranty) (discontinued by manufacturer)â works great! i used it with ravpower 3 coil upgraded version, and will not have overheat problem .   great phone, love mine .   nice phone. became a brick in one week. now currently back at motorola for a fix/replacement .   i love it. the only con is that it is power hog .   good. thanks .   good quality with reasonable price .   phone is not that good .camera quality is good but speaker seems to be faulty.it does not catch network easily .   the phone itself is perfect but it keeps giving me a message about downloading an updated that turns into some sort of weird install for a app that i don't want. now it's too late to send it back. i bought this as a backup phone and have enjoyed it quite a bit. i'm a longtime iphone user, but frequently buy and sell android phones just to tinker and play with. i usually don't keep them long, but the nexus 6 has proven itself. if you like to try out custom roms/kernels, and have the freedom to do whatever you want with your phone (some oems don't seem to understand this), this was the last great nexus imo. the 6p moved away from being a developer device and the 5x isn't much of an upgrade, unless you insist on having a fingerprint reader. this phone, with its internals and solid build quality, will surely maintain its reputation for years to come .   very good mobile phone .   value for the money .   stunning audio and voice call quality .  good form factor .   had to work with verizon since the nano card they first created didn't work correctly but after that everything seems great .   muy bueno. the phone is hanged so much that i can't even do anything while i am call. thanks .   great service. completo happy. really unlocked, amazing phone for $300 exellent product. i feel good. nice phone, best value/price forma $250. sleek and priced adequately. this phone made me orgasm, never been more happier with any other hand help device till date, kudos to motorola for building this powerful yet exquisite beauty and equal credit to google for putting love in it by upgrading it to marshmallow in no time, #nexusforlife '''. nexus 6 its a great phone big w pure google but have a problem this phone got a bug that the volume speaker dont work like supose to be. while the price has now popped back up, i bought four nexus 6's for my wife and i and my parents for $250 each. at that price you're getting a phone that was $649 just a year ago and has specs that can handle just about anything you can throw at it. i came from a lg g2 and after getting the phones i spent almost an entire day updating all the phones, getting senior loaders set up for my parents, and found myself saying to myself "i really really like this phone." it is instantly responsive, has all day battery, the quick charge is amazing, and it can handle everything that i threw at it without breaking a sweat. the two front facing speakers are really loud and surprisingly distortion free for such tiny speakers, even at higher volumes. even the camera, which was said to be middling, has done a great job for me and far outperforms my g2. my wife even said the photos looked as nice or nicer than her previous galaxy s4's photos did. the quick charge is amazing, as it seemingly charges (i haven't done any direct tests, so just "feeling") from 30% to 90% in an hour or so. either way, my g2 would be barely 20% and this thing has done 50-60%. i have now been using this for about a month and can't imagine going back. the g2 seems like a baby in comparison now, and although i was afraid it would be too big to hold, i have medium hands for a guy and i can still handle this phone quite easily. while intensive texting or writing online does take two hands, i can pull down from the top, or log in with one hand (not easy, but doable). it's also amazing for kindle reading and the battery won't immediately die .  i can't stress how awesome it is to have 9 hours of battery life in full usage. the only complaint would be that this is a beast to have to try to use in a car, so just make sure to have everything set up perfectly before you hit the road. my g2 with the button in the back was easy to reopen a map that had closed, etc, but this beast can be a bit unweildy to turn back on. it's truly sad that they didn't put the fingerprint scanner in this as they had initally planned, as that would have solved those issues. outside of that, even at $350 it's a good deal. i can't imagine newer phones having that much more to offer. it's a perfect phone for older people with hearing problems and eyesight issues. if you're wondering whether to pay $500 for the nexus 6p or $350 for this .  buy this. i've used the 6p, it's nice, but in real world situations this is just as good .   this phone arrived in perfect condition. this was a gift for my husband and he was very happy with the phone. it works well and we have no complaints. i even like it and i am not an android person .   hello prospective buyers! if you have found yourself looking at this phone, i believe it would be safe to assume you are looking for either a less expensive (though older) phone that may not be quite as capable as the most cutting edge devices, but is still capable nonetheless. i don't use many intensive applications and can't speak to how you might fare with this phone if you want to play the latest games, but if you are looking for a phone with business and light recreational uses in mind, i may be able to help you make an informed decision on whether this is the right phone for you. battery life --------------- if you're looking for a device for business purposes, it's likely you're looking for a phone you won't have to dash to a charger for. in my very anecdotal experience, i have not had any problem with needing to charge the phone between unplugging it in the morning and plugging it in right before bed. if your typical usage during the day features roughly 6-8 hours of screen-on time using apps like chrome, gmail, news apps, the sporadic use of miscellaneous banking applications, and 2-4 hours of screen-off time with music applications over bluetooth, you probably won't find yourself having to stop and recharge your phone to get through the day. watching video seems to be another story, though, with battery life lasting maybe 5-6 hours of playback. this problem is decently mitigated by the included wall charger with which youâ€™ll routinely be able to go from roughly 5% battery to 25-30% in 10 or so minutes to push through the last few hours of the day. size --------------- this phone is definitely larger than other phones available on the market. if you purchase this phone, you will probably find yourself using both hands to type, but one hand is generally sufficient for swiping through the news or documents. the keyboard doesnâ€™t feel very cramped even with my thicker fingers, and it has been fairly easy to write longer pieces when necessary. display --------------- there are plenty of reviews with lots of information about how gorgeous the display is from a technical and color standpoint, but i would like to include the fact that this phone (whether through the amoled screen or some other design) is easily viewable, even from angle, when i have polarized sunglasses on. if you find yourself outside and needing to take a quick glance at your cell phone, itâ€™s unlikely youâ€™ll have to deal with the minor annoyance of either waiting until youâ€™ve left the sunlight or temporarily removing your sunglasses if they are polarized. durability & materials --------------- this is the section that warrants taking a star away from a 5-star rating. the paint on the back of the phone will scratch, and it will leave behind fingerprints. if youâ€™re worried about maintaining a pristine exterior, you will need a phone case. if you are fine with very minor wear and tear, you should be fine without. --------------- if you are interested in phone with new android features and updates, a large display, and a battery life and horsepower sufficient for light to moderate usage, this phone likely wonâ€™t disappoint you .   good phone. a bit too wide for my taste. also after 3 weeks a green line appeared indicating the screen was failing. exchanged to a 6p. it's more expensive, but easy better .   this phone is really amazing. i wasn't sure about the large size, but i've grown to like it a lot. the speed in this things is great .   nice phone. but no option for memory card .   this phone is running the latest operating system, marshmallow for android. nice 6 inch diagonally screen, it's a litter bigger than the iphone 6. nice size for me, i don't have problems seeing the screen. i am still getting use to it. i am coming from a samsung siii. i've activated my phone with cricket wireless .   perfect product and seller. it's great product. big and everything runs smoothly .   great bang for your buck, exceptional specs, very fast, bright screen, great battery. fast shipping from amazon as well. got it in a day .   this nexus device is top notch .   cool phone .   super happy with my new phone .   excellent build quiality! best of android experience! running smooth, with crear battery life .   certainly one of my favourite phones. it would've been one of the best android phones if they just dialed back the screen to 1080p and improved the camera .   good. good. great phone that i got for a great price. idk why anyone would choose any other nexus phone over this one because you definitely get the most bang for your buck .   so far works fine .   nexus 6 is really good .  i liked it. i got this when it was on sale for $249. the nexus is a great phone. i was coming from a sony xperia t2 ultra, with only 1 gig of ram and a snapdragon 400 processor, and that just wasn't cutting it. it was a 6" phone, so i was already used to the big screen. i was considering getting this where the moto x pure edition, but the moto x was $150 more. that $150 got you a better camera, moto gestures , and a smaller screen size. both are really fast phones, and i'm not a photographer. with the moto x, you can customize your phone and even have it made out of wood. but i purchase a dbrand wood skin for $10 and my nexus looks amazing, i get several compliments on it. i've had this for a month now, and it's pretty fast. there are couple hiccups here and there, but nothing that would make you mad. you could have twenty apps open, and will still run buttery smooth. of course with the nexus, you get updates super fast, so when android n comes out, this phone will be one the first to get it. this amoled screen is great. whites aren't as white, but colors are amazing. with amoleds, the pixels turn off whatever dark portions getting shown. so the blacks on here are unreal. i was playing geometry dash on here, and the stages look absolutely incredible. is this 2014 phone still worth buying in 2016? definitely. your still getting today's phone specs, 2k amoled screen, android marshmallow, front facing speakers, and a big premium phone. a lot of these specs beat the new iphone 6s plus, and it's bigger .   good fablet. the firmware was on lolipop for a long time so had the folowing issues. had some lag when closing apps. the camera was the worst as it took a looooooonnnngggg time to take a picture. the phone gets pretty hot but not unbearable. it frooze once when i was about to take a selfie of me and my coworkers which was pretty embarrassing. the worst part it did not turn off at all. disadvantage of having a unremovable battery. when turning off and on it takes a long time to load as well. the phone itself is pretty fast i give u that. after using this phone, other phones look very small or the pixels dont catch your eye. recently updated to marshmallow. the camera seems to be working fine. the lag whenclosing apps semms to have disappeared. the phone getting hot is still here. comparatively seems a little faster than lolipop .   battery is easy to be too hot. so far so good. i wish it had the ability to be used as a remote but so far that is the only draw back. great pictures and functionality .   excellent love this phone volume is a bit low .   excellent and good price. always new software. even knows when chromebook is present .   pure android, what else is there to say .   i purchased these as a gift and they were a hit. the phone is definitely on the bigger side and its fast .   this phone is definitely worth it. bought one for me and my fiance. make sure its xt1103 though .   good. the greatest phone i have ever owned. i was an iphone guy, then i went to the moto x 2014. then the 2015 nexus line came out and the ng went on sale for $350 so i jumped on that deal. the screen is amazing. i read a lot of documents/pdfs on my phone for work, so it's a game changer for me. the battery is amazing after you get the marshmallow update, and it has very few performance issues. been using it daily for 6 months, and i'd probably buy it again over any other new phone out there. wireless charging is awesome. i was always knocking my phone over in the night with that stupid charging usb cable. with wireless you just drop that s*** on there and walk away .   every thing i wanted at a reasonable price. i love this phone. purchased the nexus 6 over the newer nexus 6p. no regrets, the 6 is an excellent phone at a great price .   i love this phone .   amazing. no, it did not. the phone is severely defective. when i put it on in the morning, it says my device is corrupt .   very fast shiping. phone new in box as described. love the phone super fast .   carrying the nexus brand as a somewhat aging product, the great deal that it has is what lured me into getting this mobile device. this is primarily a gift for my wife but i have spent some quality time with it (a good two days worth to be exact) getting things started for her. it does take a good half a day to pull down all the updates/patches before this thing is finally up to date and i have to say, coming from nexus 4, which we are upgrading from is like a breath of fresh air. we spent about the same amount of money for this phone with our nexus 4 and this is definitely day/night difference in terms of size, responsiveness, and camera functionality if you are in the market for an android phone. we also are planning on using this for project fi from google, which should translate into savings that will pay for itself so win-win for us. if you are not into the bleeding edge technology, best screen/camera available, and just simply want a great functional phone with good performance; this is the phone for you .   this is a great phone. there is nothing that comes close in terms of performance to the nexus 6 at this price point. simply the best bang for your buck in the market. is hard for me to consider any other smartphone because i automatically compare it to the nexus 6 and its price. right now the price is high ($350-$400) compared with a few weeks ago ($250-$300). exactly $100 more. so, my advice is to wait for amazon to lower the prices again for this model or for the nexus 6p .   this phone is unusable. the earpiece volume was so low that i couldn't hear anything if there was any background noise. went through a lot of stress looking through crappy, incomplete guides trying to fix the issue but in the end i dumped this phone and now i'm looking in stores because dealing with this type of thing online really sucks .   very well, the phone is much better than xiaomi. this is the best phone that i ever had .   i had no problems with this phone other than it was far too large for me. its massive .   very poorly made, bad quality product. on the first week of use the "s" fell off the "nexus" imprint in the back, lame stuff. third week of use had a very soft fall inside my house, crystal cracked, screen seemed fine. screen cracked after 2 weeks of very light usage. to make matters worse after a 1 day of being cracked it completely died on its own and never turned on again. absolutely bad quality product. no response from amazon or motorola. like new condition, battery lasts a good amount of time. lightning fast speeds. works great with verizon, takes nano sim. i got this on sale, and so far i absolutely love the phone. there are a few knocks on it like it heating up if you are using it on something quite demanding, but that is to be expected. i really enjoy the size of the phone, and just the feel of it in my hand. this phone is definitely not a one hand user phone. you'll have to use both of your hands to operate it without the risk of dropping it. my biggest annoyance is how easy it is to turn on and off the phone. the button is so sensitive, but so far that has been my only complaint .   shipped quickly on time. phone works as intended/described. brand new, in-box. all accessories provided. would strongly recommend. thanks .   its great .   this review is as much about an extremely well designed phone, as it is an end to my apple era. former apple employee (1994-2000) as well as a very long time technologist. i write very few reviews. 1) google app ecosystem vs. apple have never quite warmed to gmail, google apps, google search, google drive, etc. not sure why, everything always worked well. but, as i went through the reasonably painless shift of four years of iphone/app usage to my first ever droid, i grew more and more respect for the tight integration and speed of google photos, google now, chrome. the desktop, chromecast, mobile integration works more intuitively than apple's aging cloud apps. i'm not and never have been an intense user of itunes, but even google play and the play store offer many great advantages (pushes apps seamlessly from desktop to mobile). tight integration, and high quality at a premium have been apple hallmarks. no longer. even msft, with their surface and mobile phones are catching up. but google, despite the libertarian in me being wary of how much they know about us all, has an intense user better covered. google fit, works with all of my fitbit, strava, suunto, garmin gear better than the apple health app and apple watch, and i have so much more android wear now to choose from. debating the moto 360 2 sport vs. a high end garmin forerunner. from apple, i have no choice but watch bands or metallurgy! 2) my iphone 6s + vs. this nexus 6 have broken the screen of two iphone 6 and then 6s + in the past five months. frustrating, fragile device. the phone reception with t-mobile in the heart of the silicon valley is spotty. the nexus 6 flexes more, and has plastic vs the iphone. this does not really affect the aesthetics for me, but it may for some. what it should affect, is the durability. the iphone cracks if you look at it the wrong way. the nexus feels nice in my hand, with no case. if i drop it, will report back! hope i do not! i hate cases. the nexus is snappier in just about every measure. opening apps, browsing, download speeds over wi-fi (xfinity 175 mbps gives speed test scores of 35 on iphone, about 50 on nexus). the rapid charger works great on the nexus, about 4x faster than the iphone. not the greatest battery life, but i have every high quality tracking and location setting on. use it intensively. the larger screen does not mean a larger phone! nicely done motorola/google! the screen is amoled, and it has better colors, but not quite the crispness of my iphone. close though. all in all, the much better reception, phone quality, and speed make me very happy to have purchased this. i do miss the fingerprint authentication; however, if i wanted it that bad i would have bought the 6p (that phone seemed less well made than the nexus 6). will fill out my chrome os hardware line a bit this year, retiring my two macbook's, and likely buying a pixel c tablet, and the higher end google laptop. 3) final musings i fully expected to dislike the android experience. i bleed seven colors, which is what we used to say to each other when i worked at apple under the rainbow logo. yet, i must hand it to google for their engineering prowess, and especially the much improved user interface for just about everything in their massive ecosystem. phone is highly recommended, and so is planet android. more oxygen here than i expected .   upgrading from a s3 and this thing is amazing! it's crazy fast out of the box, but i went ahead and unlocked the bootloader and rooted from the first day. paired with franco kernal and its even faster if thats possible. purchased only $249 for 64gb. using it every place in my house. only thing it lacks is finger print sensor. other than that, i love this .   best phone i ever owned. i decided to get the nexus 6 over the nexus 6p due to significant price difference. after about a month i couldn't be happier with my 64 gb n6.nice 6" screen (could be brighter), very good front facing speakers, wireless and fast charging, great battery life on marshmallow and pretty good camera. i also like the metal frame which makes the n6 feel like a premium phone .   i have mixed emotions about this phone. it's exactly what it's advertised as, a huge six incher. it's what i signed up for, i have nobody to blame but myself. it's just too big to carry around. screen, speakers, battery, are all top notch. too big, too heavy .   perfect .   a great product and great proceso ($321 with taxes). with android 6.0.1 all is better (battery, speed). the device is huge but is perfect for movies, web browsing, and music. the front facing speakers are really good .   this phone would be perfect but you can not put a micro sd card into. you have to use the built in memory only which i cannot believe you cant. it would be nice to have to have additional storage for photos and music .   i've had any iphone4 , blu windows phone and an lg and i love this phone. great phone at a great price. big but not too big. very easy to carry and very easy to use. i would definitely buy one again. plus it is unlocked so i can use it with most phone services .   from nokia 1020 to nexus 6. a big step forward .   yes, its huge, and the battery capacyty is not greatest. but i get used to its size in few days. and now i enjoy fast and slim work of 6.0.1 android for 260$ total. best deal ever for today .   it is one big phone. if you have smaller hands, i would not recommend it. it works great with the new marshmallow release. i am very happy with it and would recommend it to someone that is used to a larger phone .   great phone. it's a pretty good phone. i love the fact that it has wireless charging along with a quick charge feature. to be honest i haven't used quick charge yet since i just normally put it on my qi charging when i get home. as for the other features it's pretty much on par with other high end motorola phones .   i'm happy with the performance, but less than pleased with the design -- i bought online without having ever used one. the rounded back may feel good in the hand, but it slides and spins on any flat surface, even with an installed case. the back is also the most ridiculous fingerprint magnet ever created by man and is smooth and slippery. don't the designers ever use these items before releasing them into the wild .   my last phone was the same - moto g 1st gen. a textured or rubberized back would be a huge plus! does run quickly with no lag and battery life is very good with my type of usage. needed to go through at least 5 updates to get to marshmallow. i don't believe i got the official t-mobile update which includes support for band 12 since my speeds are pretty bad for 4g lte, about 1 mbps -- pretty much 3g territory. all in all, i'm enjoying the smoothness and the display, but missing the comfortable size and ability to slip into any pocket. will almost surely go a bit smaller for my next phone - more like a 5 inch display .   awesome phone after updates. the software is finally here to run it properly. blazing fast and camera is really good with the new focusing software .   worst phone i have ever used the nexus 5 is better than this crap. really big but works very well,,. awesome battery life and very fast phone. it is quite large but because the back is curved it still fits nicely in my pocket and doesn't feel any bigger than my previous oneplus one. i use it with google's projectfi and so far it has good signal strength and is a good all around phone. camera takes comparable pictures to the oneplus one but seems to focus faster and has a better time in low light conditions in my experience .   the only reason why i purchased nexus 6 was the price was slashed to half the original price by the amazon. i was looking for a phone on my budget. but iam more than satisfied with this phone for the price paid. it functions super fast and the sound is awesome. the only drawback is the camera ,which takes quite nice pictures but not upto the current market standard when compared to its competitors. but for the price paid i would say its definitely worth it . the only thing i feel is completely missing is the fingerprint scanner, which will annoy you if you will have to punch in your userid and password each time you visit a web site or open your app .   yes, this model is more than a year old, but it was less than $300 and came with 64 gb storage, the first time i've had that much, and more than i need, which is nice. it is like a tablet, or, put another way, it's like a home away from home. it takes decent pictures, though perhaps not the ultimate. audio quality during calls is great. i got this because i wanted to join project fi, and i am very happy with both .   just as expected. i bought the phone but ended up returning it. i had paid 399$ + tax. if i had not bought the nexus 6p i would definitely get this phone again. i had great battery life, ended up with 50% by the time my day was over. i originally thought it was too big (too wide) and that was one of the reasons i returned it .   i've always wanted this phone since it came out but i was already on the droid turbo so i was riding it out. my wife had a refurbished samsung galaxy s4 (second one within a year from screen spots issues and pressing) that she needs another phone as this one now keeps rebooting. i've been looking at this phone since it came out and when i saw it at $250 brand new for the 32gb version, i took the plunge. a day after, i purchased a used very good one from amazon.com warehouse deals, 64gb version for about the same price and it looks like new. i'll just end up trading both phones to recoup the price of one nexus 6 phone. [i think i may keep my droid turbo for now] i won't get into the specifics of why this phone is very good but with minor flaws for the reasons below. 1. motorola has done a fantastic job in making a carrier-free no bloat ware phone. verizon stuffed a lot of apps and i tried to disable as much as i can. very clean and minimalistic which i love. 2. hardware design does matter a lot. ask apple. i'm comparing this to the nexus 6p. with the exception of the finger print scanner, this bad boy goes toe to toe with the 6p. i've seen a lot of issues with the 6p rebooting and that black thing behind at the top of the 6p. i can't stand it. motorola has been in this business for a while now and being a pioneer like the star-tac, razr and reintroduction of moto x to finally where we are today, i must say that they know a thing or two about designing phones. i was even thinking about the pure edition but for the price, i'm game with the nexus 6. 3. 6-inch is the new 5-inch. now that i'm holding this phone, it looks great to me. it still fits in all of my pockets including jackets. as the saying goes, more room to explore. i only have the privilege to watch my shows on the go on my phone and what better way to do it than the nexus 6? perfect viewing. 4. motorola has done a great job with moto connect app and all the security features to make this phone great. however, it's very limited as opposed to the droid. i set up the 'ok google' and every time i say ok, it picks up so i turned it off. some personalization would have been nice like "nexus 6 baby". the automated functions are lacking here. also, coming from the droid turbo, i will surely miss moto actions which is absent from the nexus 6. 5. since i can't remove the google bar (unless of course by disabling the whole google now thing), i wish google would have one with a clear background. i hope there is an updated version of the google bar. 6. another feature i love is the wireless charging. i've been looking at ways to incorporate it should i have purchased a pure edition but it won't be very clean and i would have to give up the usb connection on the phone as there would be a permanent wireless charging receiver. i take the wireless charging for now. i've seen some few negative reviews and hope those get corrected and hope their experience the second time is a charm. i'll update after a few weeks of using the phone .   perfecto .   this phone has a big problem. when i call someone they cannot hear i have to turn on the speaker. also it has a crackling sound. my callers told me it sound like water is in the phone for the price it is disguishing .   awesome big phone. good replacement for my former phone (nexus 5). upper speaker making buzz sound within one month making even louder static buzz within 3 months over this is the worst phone i have ever got. get an iphone my friend .   good .  but hangs for a second. the phone has a great build quality, but it gets extremely hot when charging with the provided motorola charger, which comes with the turbo charge technology. i know devices can get warm with fast charging, but this one gets really hot. i have many phones and never got one getting so hot and i have some other phones with fast charging too. i switched to another charger - the one for my lumia 1520 - and the nexus temperature went down from very hot to lukewarm. i think the charger is faulty, so i'll put it aside to avoid accidents or the risk of the phone catching fire .   love this phone. what a bargain! love this phone. upon initial start, you'll experience several updates so wait until it's completed done (adroid 6.0 marshmallow) before customizing phone to your needs. beautiful screen, nice big juicy screen that reminds me of my galaxy note 2. battery life is good, but it won't last a full day with average use or even minimal use in my case b/c i have on location and bluetooth most of the time. phone is fast! no sluggish experience. $299 with prime was the best deal one can get for such a device. if you're in need of a phone or give gifts, this is it .   i have never been more impressed or happier with a cellphone. a powerhouse in every way .   this is actually my first or one of my first review. i purchased this some weeks ago for having as my second phone. i also have an asus zenfone 2 4gb ram and 64gb rom and i have to be honest, this nexus 6 can stand aside of my asus. performance and display quality is outstanding. haven't test nexus 6p, but this performance is remarkable. the only reason for having as a second phone is that it is not dualsim (i own three different carriers sim cards because of my job), otherwise would be my first option .   best phone in the market. i bought this phone recently as a second phone & for what i'm using it for and or the price ($245), i have no complaints. i traded up my note 4 for an iphone 6s but wanted an android phone (and big one at at) for those times during travel or when i needed a big phone. but seriously for an everyday phone, this is way too big to carry around in my pocket. anyway, here's my take on this phone. pros ----------------------------------------------- > beautiful design > good performance > high-res display (fhd) > pure android experience > fastest os update > wireless charging capabilities > turbo charging - allows you to charge in less than 30 minutes . > reasonably priced (bought this for only $245) > google fi wireless service cons ------------------------------------------------ > battery life is below average for a phablet phone. > too big for one-handed use > somewhat bulky - way bigger than my galaxy note 4. > photos look bad in low-light situations. > older technology (snapdragon 805/adreno 420 gpu) > lacks wifi calling (for t-mobile use) beautiful design this phone is big but classy. at 3.27 inches across, its also a little wide for someone with small hand. weighing in at nearly 6.5 ounces, it's also heavier (and thicker) than my galaxy note 4 but otherwise its very sleek looking and because of the curved back it's actually easier to hold than my note 4. display this is the main & perhaps the only reason why you would want this phone. the screen was vibrant, razor sharp, and immersive. the nearly six inches of screen makes watching everything much easier and that's not to mention if you're playing graphics-intensive games which also worked smoothly and looked even better. colors and fine details was on par with the best flagship phones. software/os this is perhaps another major reason why i got this phone. i'm already running the latest android marshmallow and it's great. the os has also helped with the sub-par battery life i was getting when it came with android 5.1 lollipop. getting the latest update faster than anyone else is also one of the biggest reasons why you would want to buy a nexus phone and that's not to mention the fact that this phone doesn't come with any garbage carrier or manufacturer installed apps. battery life the 3,220 mah battery supposedly should deliver an estimated 8.5 hours of internet browsing on wi-fi and 7 hours on lte, with a reported talk time of up to 24 hours and a standby time of 300 hours. however my mileage was much less at least not until i upgraded to marshmallow. right now i can go the whole day (with several hours on the phone and fair use of browsing and at 9 pm i still have 25% battery left so this is great. conclusion overall, i am happy with my purchase. but again this is my second phone but if this was my primary phone, i don't know since it is actually a big phone. if you're looking for an inexpensive phablet phone with good performance and clean os, you can't go wrong with this .   bought this and had it deliverd to my hotel. the phone is awesome and i give it a solid 4 .   **** please note the following **** this is an unlocked device with no carrier bloatware. it can be used on multiple carriers and should have the necessary bands for just about every major carrier, but to be sure check first. there also are two different versions of this device being sold. one is for european use and one for north america. the device you need if you are in the us is the +++ xt1103 model number 00632nartl +++. i'm running mine on a t-mobile pre-paid sim and get 4g lte with no issues. the international version is the xt1100 model sm3969ay2b1. it "may" work albeit without lte speeds on us carriers. again double check bands before purchase. **** thanks **** recently bought this on sale. i've always wanted to try a nexus device and the price was right. if you can handle the size this is a great device. make no mistake though it is a big phone. phone upgraded to latest android marshmallow when i powered it up. it runs smooth and fast with stock android. build quality is great, front facing speakers great, screen great. media looks fabulous on the amoled quad hd display. doesn't allow for external sd card but the 32gb internal storage is fine for me. even though this is last years nexus device. it is still a very good device and can hang with the current flagships out there. since it's a nexus device you can be assured that software updates will be available for the next few years. battery life has been very good, easily gets me through a busy day and the phone supports qi wireless charging and also qualcomm quick charge. camera is good, not great though. my lg g2 camera is better but the n6 camera is good enough for most functions. the 4k ultra hd video is awesome. one thing to be aware of is this is a very slippery device. the huge size combined with the slippery feel is a magnet for drops. i highly recommend you purchase a case at the same time you purchase the phone. i originally got the ringke tpu style case just to have something. it's a nice tpu but offers little in the way of serious drop protection. ringke shock absorption scratch resistant drop protection bumper case cover for nexus 6 - smoke black after using the ringke a few days i decided i wanted something that offers more protection so i went with a seidio surface case. i've used those before and have had good luck with them. it's more rugged than the ringke and also has a kickstand on the back. it offers full protection but doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone. like i said this is a very big device and your case choice is limited if you're trying to not add bulk to an already big phone. seidio surface case with metal kickstand for motorola nexus 6 - retail packaging - royal blue whether or not the seidio offers more protection remains to be seen and i hope i never drop the nexus 6 to find out. if you're like me and have wanted to try a nexus device, the pricing on the n6 is dropping so you can get a great deal on a great device .   amazing phone for the price this phone is bulletproof. a very quick delivery, amazing package .   the phone is fine and comes exactly as described. however, in the description the seller described the charger as the original charger but the one that came with the phone was a normal motorola charger not the turbo charger that comes with the nexus 6 .   i read a lot and also asked a question to see if this was an unlocked international .i got answered that yes so i ordered international version and got a us version. i just got the phone into my hands and when i want to make a return i cant because it closed 2 days ago. im from argentina and now i have a usless cellphone when i ordered something different. dont recommend .   the best phone i've ever owned. root and install purenexus rom, and you'll be in heaven .   love it. phone is brand new and comes in a sealed manufacturers box with warranty. these phones are very fragile. i dropped mine from about 18" off the ground and the screen shattered. $200 to repair. motorola sent me a replacement phone but the replacement has a problem with the vibrator and haptic feedback. sounds like it's actually loose and rattling. not that this review will make a difference because they are sold out anyway .   even though this phone is year old, it still competes with the new flagships due to its ram and storage. i was able to get this hooked up on verizon with no issues. the only downside was since the phone is older it had to take 4 updates before it was up to date. great phone compared to the samsung in that the voice call quality is better. i do, however, miss the samsung's built-in feature that shuts the phone off when you close the case .   when i receive it,it si broken ,i am so sadly. nice display. snappy performance. love the fast charger. screen brightness is slow to auto-adjust when first turned on, so it is overly-bright for maybe five seconds, but that's software and may be improvable [it could be related to the pure nexus 6.1 rom]. the curved back is a nuisance when using the phone as a table-top calculator, but otherwise is probably more comfortable than a flat back would be. at $300, i like the phone and will probably run the wheels off of it .   i purchased and set this phone up for a family member and so far it has worked well. obviously being a nexus device, this phone has always been updated with the monthly security updates and has run smoothly day one. i would say that the biggest con for the phone is the fact that the camera isn't the best but it does take pictures that should be good enough to show off to friends/family .   buyer described the product as-is. it was so helpful to receive up to date tracking info with my purchase and the 2 free phone cases made it even more sweet .   so good. great screen okay camera great price nowdays i say go for it if you want pure android experience without paying extra for nexus 6p or 5x. i got this phone for my mom and it's really awesome. the display quality is great. the screen size is big. the battery life is very good. no bloatware--just android in its pure form. hd audio calling on t-mobile works like a charm. front facing camera quality could be better but at this price point it's very acceptable. rear facing images are good but not great when compared to leading flagships phones. most people will be very satisfied with the image quality. i give it an 7.5/10 compared to an iphone 6s .   great phone and excellent shopping experience. worst phone with audio issue  .   seems many has this problem .   phone is perfectly fine except this issue  .   i purchased a refurbished model and i could not be happier. this phone was in 10/10 condition. thanks edgecell. kudos to amazon warehouse deals! phone came in new condition and works perfectly. phone was in the original box with all original items. as for the phone (after i gotnused tonthe size) its great .   amazing phone, great price .   i love it and i just wanted a new upgrade for christmas. so i decided to get this and i'm proud i did. some people suggested the 6p but i didn't feel like spending the extra money to get it. i would suggest this phone to my friends, and family. i did not get this product for free/ or for review .   very good. great phone! it's big, but if you are looking for an unlocked phone here you probably already know the dimensions of it .   me and my husband love these phones. awesome big screen and long battery life as well as runs super fast and 32gb of space .   awesome, easy phone. i have really enjoyed the shopping experience with amazon. i can research without pressure from customer service (sales) staff .   just perfect. we give this a gift to my daughter and she loves it, especially the resolution of the camera .   i have had my new nexus 6 for about a week now. my previous phone was the htc one m7, which i love but my battery was starting to give out after three years of use. perfect excuse to upgrade to the nexus 6. my initial experience with the nexus 6 is a positive one although there are a couple things i would change: 1. the power button is too close to the volume buttons. i frequently find myself pressing power when i intended to press volume up. i wish the power button were located at the top of the phone like my old m7. 2. the camera just doesn't seem as good as the camera i had on my m7. the led flash isn't as bright either. those are my only complaints. i absolutely love the huge screen! i will never go back to a smaller screen size. the front facing speakers are another reason i wanted this phone. they are nearly as good as the boom sound speakers on my htc one. they have great volume and clear sound. it's a great experience watching tv or movies on this phone! the price was what convinced me to buy this phone. $249. for a nexus which i immediately updated to marshmallow. wow! can't beat it! why would i pay around $600 - $700 for a s6 or note 5? i couldn't turn it down. the phone does take some getting use to for using with one hand. it takes both hands to cover the entire screen real estate. battery life so far seems reasonable. it gets me through a day at work with moderate use. i love that it has built in wireless charging. i have an anker wireless charge pad i purchased on amazon on my nightstand which works great even with the spigen bumper case i have on the phone. i am happy with the phone and knowing i saved myself around $400 it feels even better .   excellent smartphone .   love the phone .  great  .  big screen. wow. what an amazing phone. just love it. super elegant and sophisticated .   it has moved to the nexus 6 from the iphone. first, although android was inconvenient, it is often used while very happy now .   very nice phone and nice price. still getting used to it and all its functions. my first motorola and very pleased so far .   khan lee is awesome .   came in perfect condition, and the only thing not perfect was the box, so who cares? i get the pure android experience without all the phone brand garbage apps (android 6 marshmallow by the way), and i got on project fi, which is google's own phone service that is much less expensive than any other service. hardware wise, this phone is no slouch either, with a qhd screen (like a 4k tv), stereo speakers, an elegant design, and a 13 gb image sensor that allows you to take incredibly good photos and 4k video .   what's not to love about this .   great phone, great value. still a great phone and this purchase was a great price. running project fi on it without a hitch .   this phone truly exceeded my expectations. the battery, camera, speakers and software are amazing. my only gripe is the size of the phone .   it is big and takes a little time to get used to. the screen is very vibrant and worth the extra real estate space. it has been a joy to text, read, and view videos on .   amazing phone , bought as part of thanks giving deal . bought 2 and totally happy . google phones are always first ok introducing new features  .   love it, good purchase,. best android everrrrrrrr! love the size, no bloatware, and best of all battery live + fast charge. excellent phone at attractive prices. battery is long lasting and charging is very fast. the screen is perfect size as it function as both phone and tablet .   great item as described .   love this phone and at this price it's a no brained. it's big so if you're used to a smaller phone it may take some getting used to. it works great for me and the phone is extremely responsive. i'm on project fi and that also is great on this phone .   i'm beyond happy with this for $300 it was a no brainer i like it more then my moto x pure and i hope everyone knows it takes a nano sim not micro cause i didn't xd. excellent phone .   it runs fast and use less power compare with lg. when i first use i thought its camera was just so so. but after the system upgraded to 6.0, i took some pictures using hdr and without hdr. the pics looks great when i compared it with my cannon g16 .   awesome  .  had s5 and switched to it .  i like the size and reviews were good too .  nothing went wrong  .  better than my expectation  .  on top of that android 6 .  no stupid touchwiz  .  people had questions abt camera quality .  my wife have nexus5x  .  and hard to see a diff if u just click and ahoot user .  if u like phablet u cant be wrong with it. great for the price .   coming from owning a chep low phone .   to a nexsus .   it's a big difference. on performances .   an out the box updates ready to marshmallow 6.0.1. the phone is fast .   no freezes. love the phone .   better than i expected it .   i find this phone to be just what wanted. the features matches any other that i've used before, including samsung and iphone. the internal storage is phenomenal, and i've been able to use the phone in several countries. i'm very happy with my purchase. i like this phone. however, sometimes the phone signal seems week. i can pretty much always make or receive a phone call though .   great overall phone. i use it for business evey day and even with heavy processor usage it hasn't hung up or crashed yet. it takes great photos, better than my dslr.the exterior is super slippery, so a cover is a must. the sound is so so and its sometimes hard to hear the person on the other side. i got the phone new but almost half off, which is good because otherwise i'd be disappointed. so as long as you don't pay full price you will be very happy with a great phone .   just amazing. wonderful product and i am loving it. i have no complaints as far as this phone is concerned. works great and i got a great deal on it . i find myself using it more than my note 5 .   excellent phablet, especially for the sale price. my only disappointment is entirely due to the fact that i didn't more closely read the specs: no notification light .   great phone. been using this phone for the last 6 months. so far, very good. + really big screen, very nice display. + charges faster. holds charge for more than a day of normal use. + fast processing and highly responsive. + great sound. perfect for videos and movies. + good price. - huge phone. little difficult for one hand operation. most people might need to adjust their mobile handling habits when upgrading to this from a smaller phone .   it works great. but sometimes the screen goes crazy and pixalated. i have to turn the screen on and off several times until the screen goes back to normal .   nice phone, and it was indeed the us model. and it was a very good deal for that price. battery life is great. i did not like the default google now launcher, so i've installed my old smart launcher and everything is smooth now. marshmallow upgrade took sometime but it was effortless .   the phone works great. just be aware that you have to contact the factory instead of amazon after 30 days of purchase if anything happens to the phone .   great phone! no complaints .   the best phone iv'e had, right up there with nokia 3310 .   pros: charging last for more than a day with moderate use with lte, wifi on. i mean by moderate is, around 1 hour of talk, 1 hour of browsing and 20 to 30 minutes of video play. i have installed lot of apps and it is still runs very fast. cons: 1. heavy 2. when in charging, it will hot for around 5 minutes .   good phone .   got the delivery soon from prime. its a little large phone .   but one can get used to it quickly  .  i got the marshmallow update working as well. when i saw the screen, it was just the right size, my father has big fingers and also is having hard times reading from small screens, and its fast great product .   stylish,fit perfectly. i love it .   amazing phone. loving it .   great phone for my teen son .   charger drains battery  .   if size is not an issue then you just found the phone of your dreams .   awesome phone .   proud owner of it. great phone! takes little bit more than an hour to charge all the way through and the battery lasts all day [i use bluetooth pretty much all day when away from home]. highly recommended. the phone wasn't unlocked. i am disappointed in the battery life, but like the size .   works good for me. i bought 64 gb midnight blue one directly from amazon prime in lowest possible price i.e. $299. i got the boxed intact brand new us version (xt 1103) as mentioned in description. i would simply say, this is my most perfect purchase and i love the awesome and fantabolous phone too much. nexus 6 is the best android in universe in this price .   excellent phone with good features no doubt .   may be a little too big in size which has led to the reduction of the same with the next model nexus 6p .   kudos to the team! n thanks amazon for its prompt n expedited delivery as always! keep up the good work .   purchased two of these on black friday. my husband and i both love them. thought i might not like as a lot bigger than my last phone, but i think it would be very hard to go back to a smaller phone. i love being able to see everything more clearly and everything fits on my home screen now (in folders) .   this was my second buy from amazon since thanksgiving last year. the first one was bought for $199 (great deal). so when i saw the phone was put on sale for $249 in december, i purchased one again for my wife. the phone packaging was great as usual. however, i noticed the phone lens ring seemed to have a minor cut, stopping short of making a complete ring. seemed like a some form a manufacturing defect, but didn't return assuming that it is not a defect. no issues were identified yet. i will update in future if something pops up .   cons: it is a bigger phone then i am used to, but now it has been a couple of weeks and i am ok with it. the first day there were about 10 updates on the device to android marshmallow. pros: the screen, sound(speakers), camera, and overall speed of the device is amazing. the battery is better then expected after reading other reviews. i get a full day and then some(streaming music, checking fb, instagram etc.) the call quality is awesome using on metro pcs in nyc. i would recommend this phone see below. .i took this photo with it's awesome camera. best phone i ever bought. will not play wma files however .   i've had the phone for 2 weeks now and i really love everything about this phone but earlier this week, i was watching some youtube videos and all of the sudden half the screen stopped working. it's randomly happened twice now since then so i ordered a replacement. from a quick google search this is a problem some people are having and that it's a hardware issue so crossing my fingers that the replacement doesn't run into it because i like this phone so much .   i'm very satisfact this model. very fast, good display and good price! thanks dealer .   great phone for the price .   though some people have an issue with the size of this phone, let me assure you that as someone coming from an iphone 5s, the nexus 6 is a revelation! i simply could not go back to a small screen phone. in addition, the speed and velvety smooth operation of this beast is truly awesome. considering i purchased the 64gb model for $299, i am more than happy and satisfied with my purchase. this is an amazingly powerful media consumption and mobile productivity tool. selah .   this phone is exc. fast, pretty, lots of storage and a massive screen to watch movies and read. the android version it comes with is pretty good too. being a loyal iphone user it wasn't that hard to move to android using this phone .   best phone i've owned, hands down. large, but not intrusive. loaded with features, real android experience. display is amazing. sound from speakers is impressive. camera is better than anticipated. as good as any phone out there .   in all honesty, i would give it a 4.5, but a 5/5 works. it's an amazing phone and it was for an amazing price. it can be used on any network and i don't think i'll ever use a non-nexus phone again .   good one. still dealing with my learning curve after a long history of iphone. first, it is large and hard to hold. as it happens, because of the location of the power on switch, my finger usually hits here and powers off when i don't want it to. also, i am using project fi (also a learning curve), and that takes a really long time to power back on. given that all of this is new, i'm still figuring out what is the phone vs. what is the os. the price was right, but having some consumer dissonance on this one. still, i won't be using it as much as when i worked, so maybe will get better. and then .  all i have to do is remember that i would have had to pay three times as much for an iphone. i feel better already! :). i love this phone. can't understand why google stopped making / selling it. it arrived on time and it was brand new in box as described. very happy with this phone. i was expecting to be disappointed after reading some of the reviews. they were so wrong. if you are looking for a bigger screen this phone is perfect, not to mention the great price. sooo very happy with this purchase. so far, google fi network is great too .   the nexus 6 is exactly what i expected it to be. if you don't like samsung, this is a good alternative for android .   this is an amazing cellphone that in my opinion is still relevant today .   i got my nexus yesterday, seemed a little big in the hands but awwww my its a lovely phone .   i love it .   well over a month into my ownership, the phone is still performing very well. the battery retains charge for well over 24 hours with fairly light use, including some youtube/music/twitch/netflix (~1 hour/day) use. screen is bright and responsive. android marshmallow (6.0+) os is very nice .   yes, this is last year's flagship but it is still an excellent phone. you get all the latest android updates as they come out, including the all important monthly security patches. the screen is big and beautiful, the sound quality is great and it is made by motorola and very similar to their moto x. you should be aware that this phone is huge. if you have small pockets, you may want to consider something else. there is no fingerprint scanner on this phone but i don't think that is a big deal. i've been very happy with it so far. happy enough that i got another one for my son .   this mobile for the price is considered one of the best android mobiles ever . the build and shape is unique, the operating system is regularly updated, and the mobile all around is fun to use. amazing phone by google/motorola, a little bit big and took some getting used to. i originally had an lg g3, but it met its fate with the tires of a 56,000lb vehicle. i ordered the phone from amazon due to the better price and no carrier installed software. it can be hard to find a case you like but there are some options. it had about 15 updates that had to be installed for the os after activation, but it didn't take very long. all in all its faster, seems to be of better resolution, the speakers face you, so its great for movies, and the camera seems to take better pictures. i would buy it again, if i manage to run this one over .   great product from google. loved it using .   a lot like my moto g 2nd gen. the battery life was not good the first couple of days, and it gets hot when charging i believe it is the fast charge. it cools down after a while. i have only had it a few days, so i hope it holds up like the g. it is a big phone and at times i have trouble finding the ear speaker. it is fast and the lte is so much faster than my g with 3g .   good phone, hardly perfect, its sorely lacking basic features. easy ringplus+ activation using 446c sim. getting 4g connectivity. absolutely brand new in sealed box. (+)screen resolution - 1440p - video playback is stunning i never thought i could consume video on a phone/tablet (+)dual front facing speakers - just a massive improvement on any phone speakers i have heard. (+)good cpu and 3gb ram. feels snappy, responsive. no lag. (+)quick charging (+)clean android without carrier bloat. (+) battery life is good not great (+)$249 (-)overall form factor is too large. (-)no top bottom orientation reference. phone looks the same from both ways until you pick it up and look. (-)no physical home button (-)poor camera. low light photos are unusable. the camera is just ok. (-)just plain awful screen brightness in direct sun. (-)no indicator lights (-)vibration unit is too strong, too frequent, and sounds loose and cheap. every button press you get reminded of the rattle. (-)poor button placement. all 3 buttons stacked mid phone, same side. (-)low call volume at max level. almost have to use speaker phone at all times. (-)no removable battery (-)mediocre 4g antennae. get 3g at home - used to get 4g (-)usb 2.0 slow transfer (-)rounded back makes magnetic holders difficult or impossible to use. few options for car holders because awkward size shape. (-)very heavy phone. *last 3 phones: lg volt, galaxy s5, galaxy s3. good item i like. i bought this as a gift for my grandson, he is tickled! thank you .   great deal .   great phone, i used to have a samsung galaxy s3 prior to this phone. nexus 6 is a huge phone for people with small hands like me, but you get used to it in no time. the only downside is that i can't seem to use the phone with just one hand like i used to with samsung s3. but, the phone has great audio, camera, and is super fast! i use it with t-mobile (and have used it with cricket wireless) .   super phone for super price .   even worse than the phone i used 5 years ago. very very slow. i hated it. i assumed that google phone is fast and stable. but this one just make me feel disappoint with google. again, this phone is very slow. and the performance score is really low. i hated it .   it is my third nexus(nexus s -> nexus 5 -> nexus 6). probably because of cyanogenmod :) first of all, it is huge. even for big hand. next time i will prefer 5.5 inches as max. but watching videos and playing games is much comfortable on it. second point is that i like amoled screens more than ips screens. :) third point is that at the beginning i was thinking that missing sd slot is an issue. but after nexus 5 i changed my mind. i'm ok with that, file transfer speed over usb is good enough. 32gb or even 64gb as in my n6 right now is enough for everything. i have couple of navi apps installed with their maps, bunch of songs etc. still have a lot of space. not a small concern. i did like color diode in n5 but i don't like in n6. different colors are looking the same, probably because it is located under the cover of dynamic. but what is really good in comparing with n5 is that wifi and 4g/3g signal is much better on this phone. also battery is not bad either. in general i like it .   big phone with a grew screen and battery life. 64gb is enough space. a great product. i bought it on black friday for $200, a great deal. i upgrade to nexus 6 from 4s. a big step. so far, i love it. big. not too big. you have a phone and a pad at the same time. my wife is an iphone fans, she now always take my phone to watch video. higher resolution. great experience to watch video. battery is good enough to use. i use it to read and browse all day, found it good enough for a day use. and the charger that came with it can fast charge it from empty to full in less than 2 hours. fast. you can now easily upgrade the system to 6.0, a much better experience .   purchase was easy via amazon. had to send back 1st phone, they sent a used one. amazon was excellent on return and replacement. phone is big, but that's why i bought it. the screen real estate is enough to make surfing or movie watching enjoyable. i have android 6.0.1 and phone is quite snappy. it has a few hiccups, i expect it is me before i think it's the phone. glad i bought it. it replaced my nexus 5 from 2013 .   i just received my nexus 6 unit last week and have been very happy with everything about it. i tried the apple 6 plus earlier, but actually had two of them fail due to different hardware issues. had the boys at the genius bar diagnose both and agreed it was not user error. got my full refund ($649+$99 apple care+ tax). went back to my $55 nokia windows phone until amazon ran these units for $249 in mid-jan this year. gotta say, it has been like having the 6 plus again, w/o the hardware issues of the apple. people who like the apple camera will love the nexus camera. great photos! the "ok google .  " feature (like siri) seems to work voice-recognition near-perfectly, as did siri. i was even able to transfer my very large "contacts" list over from apple w/o losing a thing! (check youtube for details on the easy process). oh, and the battery seems to be around 70% full by days end. quite honestly, i haven't found anything i've lost from the apple 6 plus other than the obvious extra cost. i think i'm beginning to feel better about the nexus performance than the apple. i am not a guy that gets into the weeds about the features and benefits of a cell phone, just a more casual user that likes more of the basics .   excellent phone, full fit all the functionality that i need. the best choice .   very nice it is. i brought it as a gift to my father in law. though he needn't to use much of apps, he kinda of like it .   the phone is great. i love the battery life compared to my previous nexus 5. i am still getting used to the size, but reading, pictures and videos are awesome on it .   the phone get hot easily. worst phone .   i love it. the phone exceeded my expectations .   this phone is awesome. good. happy with it so far (less than a month). side is adequate for use as a tablet and just about acceptable for use as a phone .   best cellphone i have ever owned .   nice phone. i like it for its size .   excellent product and awesome customer service by amazon. this is an excellent phone at 200 dollars .   this is an excellent phone. with the amazon deal for $250, this is a steal. the only thing that's stopping me from giving 5 stars is the size of the phone. at a screen size of 6 inches, it is huge and feels bulky in the pocket. but, i am sure i'll get used to this over time .   best smartphone i have ever owned. my ideal size would be a *slightly* smaller version, but i have grown accustomed to the size and don't even think about it anymore. this is, unfortunately, the fourth phone i have had in the last year (two samsungs), but this is the best of the bunch. samsung really needs to address their screens, they break too easily and replacement parts are exorbitant. very glad i made this purchase .   i like but it's so big for me. i prefer the new nexus 6p. beautiful appearance and easy to use .   great bargain .   excellent product. awesome handset. great screen! but when the phone in use, the display turns off unless use of the speaker or bluetooth! drop calls but not b phone fought,! i love it though! nice and smooth! camera could b better but i bought for 250! can't beat it .   this is an amazing phone for $250. i wanted to get the nexus 6p but to be honest the nexus 6 still does an amazing job. compare to the price of the 6p, this is a better deal. fast charging, wireless charging, great speed, amazing display, latest os marshmallow 6.0.1 and an ok camera, you can't go wrong with this phone. i guess the biggest con is the cameras, rear is ok but the front is just awful .   looks like i got lucky. definitely worth paying the 250 for it. some of the other sellers had it cheaper, but paid a little extra for "very good". it looks bradnew and works great worth the extra 20bux in my opinion .   i don't like it. too big for me maybe cause i got so used to the n4. also i miss a lot of features from the n4. camera improved a lot tho .   a great product except the huge size .   it was nice. actually to nice that it got stolen on the third day :( it was a gift to my boyfriend. this phone met all the expectations and he was really enjoying it. the screen was large enough, links to google account, fast operating system, high resolution, and all the good stuff. too bad it got stolen. hope whoever has it now gets good use of it, and treasure it as much as we did .   nice phone. coming from a samsung t989, this is a powerhouse. i wish the display was a bit brighter, it's a challenge outside in the sun. if the display was a bit brighter, and it had removable storage and battery, this would be my perfect phone .   so far so good with the nexus 6 .   move. very nice phone for $250 price tag, 6 inch screen maybe little big for girls. it works perfectly, the camera takes owsome pictures, the voice valume is very good and i have plenty of selections for all choices of portals to use. a fine mobile smart phone .   64gb working great. got my free sim upgrade from att as the old cut sim was holding my download speeds to 8mbps. after the sim upgrade, downloads jumped to 62mbps down. simply amazing. no hiccups so far and loving the speed. amazing that a phone is faster than a few of my pcs that are currently running in various capacities. it is a huge unit, but it works for my aging eyes. currently have the fonts one step above normal and i can see most pages without issue. i use it one hand with no problems, but there i times i have to switch to two hands. my project fi sim will be arriving soon and to see if google can keep up with my travels compared to att. i'm not much of a rooter, but did it to test something and it was really easy. took me longer to read up on the process than to actually do it. it's already back to factory image to play with the project fi sim when it arrives .   are you kidding me? this is one great phone. love it. everyone is jealous. great buy. great product .   good phone almost for free .   i've bought 3 of these phones for my wife and 2 daughters. the large size isn't an issue. they don't have large hands and haven't had any problems. we've not had any problems after updating to marshmallow 6.1. i suggest doing so by wi fi before installing your sim card and connecting to your carrier. battery life is quite good. better than my nexus 6p, which has a larger battery and slightly smaller screen. go figure. the nexus 6 is fast, stable and marshmallow 6.1 is fantastic. the only problem we've had was with the proximity sensor when using a screen protector. others have mentioned the screen going black and not responding. the screen protectors sold for this phone do not have a cutout for the proximity sensor. the protector interferes with the sensors operation. we removed the screen protectors and the problem went away. with gorilla glass 3, i doubt the screen protector offers much, if any additional protection .   by far the best cell i used ever and cheap too. motorola is trying a come back, enjoy it .   at $300 you cannot beat the value of the nexus 6 if you can cope with the size and bulk of this behemoth. personally, although my hands are not huge, i had no problem transitioning from a "small" 5" phone (nexus 5) to this 6" inch giant, very few weaknesses, unless you are a photo buff (the camera is somewhat weaker than that of a samsung galaxy, but for what i use it for, still completely adequate). i am still in awe at how much technology and user-friendliness you can buy(android marshmallow is excellent and getter better all the time) for a mere $300 today. imho there is no justification for shelling out an extra $250 for the nexus 6p, unless money is no object to you. moreover, the nexus 6 built quality is far superior to that of the nexus 6p which is a flimsy piece of aluminum. this consideration tipped the balance for me when looking for a phone to replace my beloved nexus 5. for full disclosure, my opinion is influenced by the fact that i could not care less about toting the sleekest, greatest looking gizmo in my pocket (not that the nexus 6 is a bad looking phone in my opinion). if you think that a smartphone is a status symbol or a fashion statement, then buy an iphone6+. perfect .   neat android .   enjoy it. great phone at a good price .   great phone so far. i've had it for a few days now, so here are my first impressions. i was able to use the phone right off the bat on the verizon network with no problem at all. my previous phone already used a micro sim card so i just transferred it to the nexus and it was virtually seamless. i have had no issues using the phone so far on the verizon network. the performance of the phone in general has been very good. the battery life is very good, though with moderate to heavy use you may not get a full day, you'll certainly get close. the quick charger that comes with the phone is great, so even if you do need to give it a little boost during the day it's so quick that it's not a hassle. i haven't even experienced any lagging, switching from app to app is quick. call quality is good, no complaints there either. the camera is decent though i haven't used it too much yet. all in all i'm very pleased and hope the phone keeps holding up well. my only current complaint is the phone has no message light indicator. i've heard that the phone does actually have one hidden under the top speaker area, but to activate it you need to root the phone which effectively voids your warranty so i'm not sure i want to do that. there is a feature on the phone that will turn the screen on when you get a message, so you could use that as an alternative if needed .   nice phone. love it. very nice phone, though it can get very hot easily after playing a game for about 15 minutes it can drain your phone's battery down about 4 percent.but that's really the only con, i can easily get a whole day with about 30 percent left, with heavy usage. good camera for social media etc. i'm getting good 4g lte speed with t-mobile from california. overall this is a very good phone and has a good battery, a good camera, good signal from the big companies such as t-mobile verizon atnt and sprint. also do not fear of the big screen i got used to it in about 2 days and this is me coming from a 4.7 inch screen. arrived quick and is exactly as expected. bought this for my wife. shipped fast and worked as expected. beautiful display .   this is good as my expectation .   awesome. nexus 6 is better than samsung galaxy'. great phone. camera was not all working .   absolutely loved my nexus 6 and i recommend this if you are looking for an android phone. sometimes the screen locks and becomes unresponsive. other than that, it's great .   nice phone, sound quality is great, single nano sim device .   no phone can beat this price update: the phone work great at the beginning but suddenly and without any reason the rear camera stopped. i discovered it's a common issue in nexus phones but unfortunately i was not a ware of it  .   the phone is still in the one year warranty but unfortunately this happen after 30 day of returning so i contacted motorola but they ask me to contact the seller  .   i contacted amazon and they offer replacement but no new phones were available at same model (64 gb) so they offer refund but i had to pay 59$ restocking fee for a nexus defective unit. would not recommend any nexus phone to anyone. great phone, highly recommended .   probably would have given 5 stars if had a user manual. really like the large screen .   best phone i have ever owned. love the size .   really good mobile compared with price .   decent phone but the wifi sucks. can't connect at the gym. that's my only complaint really, but that dedicatedly sucks .   what a giant. slippery as an eel. i dare you not to drop it, again. it does have wireless charging and it is a nexus .   the phone is great. it was delivered though i will receive it in couple of weeks. :). google and the nexus 6 have made it so that the wifi hotspot is disabled without going through your carrier. for me, cricketwireless charges $10 a month for 1gb of mobile hotspot. for this reason, i returned the phone. $10 a month over 2 years .  $200 .  it's my data .  i can do what i want with it! i guess if you root it you can install other tethering apps. however, you might brick the phone and i am not going through all the steps to root the thing, even if i could get it to work. i even tried foxfi. only thing is pda.net and use the usb or bluetooth but that sucks for tablets .   great phone. very good. thanks amazon, for as it was mention .   good phone. they locked some features such as notification light and double tap weak up. you have to buy a third party application to use notification light. also there is no option the show battery percentage on the top of the screen. other then i love my new phone .   great phone as long as you don't mind carrying a humongous phone .   excellent smartphone i have ever had. robust. faster battery is lasting in normal use to 2 days. really i recommend to any one want practically smartphone. good value, nice screen that create good color .   great phone at a great price .   have been using this for a few months overall performance is ok, though i haven't loaded it with apps there are some intermittent hanging issues and also especially camera app hangs. overall picture quality and battery standby is good .  can run all day on a single full charge .   perfect mobile phone,i just love it .   quality is very good .   this was for my wife is is a techno-phobe. she has had no complaints and she like the larger screen .   great phone, battery lasts all day! wifi is slow possibly due to marshmallow and not so great camera and calendar app .   us model, works great. bought for my girlfriend. i already had one .   buggy phone after update. occassional unresponsive screen when typing . locks up and freezes .   for $264 - one of the best phones with 64gb and 5.9" screen and direct android os upgrade from google! what not .   i purchased this phone on a promotional deal and i could not be more thrilled with this product. the phone is a little large, but it's a terrific phone with great features, easy to use software, and is high quality. you can't beat the price .   nitidooooooo excelente. excellent phone, large screen display .   excellent phone .   like it, good phone. if dual sim will be perfect. i am very pleased with this phone, it is such a joy to experience google os without the extra apps. i picked it up a year late for cheap, which makes it a great value .   great phone. great phone for basic tasks responsive and trouble free so far will give further review in 6 months time. i bought two nexus 6, 64gb. one worked well. the battery life is much better than nexus 4. i can use it whole day without recharging it. the other one has sensor issue. the screen does not turn back on again after i finish phone conversation. there was no way for me to hang up the phone or check voice message. it was returned. however, i could not get a replacement phone due to the supply limitation. overall, i like the phone. but the quality check at manufacturer should be more stringent .   it broke after only one phone call and burned out my sim card. nice phone to have it .   nexus 6 works great. no problems with it. unlocked and works great on my sprint plan. shipped right on time .   great phone .   not happy with the spilt screen issue .   the nexus 6 is a great phone. i like the fact that it works on both gsm nd tdma networks. it is robust and wide display allows me to read books comfortably. using it on the internet is a pleasure .   thanks for sale. good phone .   like the phone will recommend. awesome phone running the latest software. it's awesome. all the google apps suite run flawlessly .   great phone, well designed, marshmallow is great .   awsome phone, a lot better than the galaxy s6 .   it doesn't work with those class screen protector, which cause black screen when call in/out, and cannot be recovered unless the other side hang up .   good phone, good price. i did not like it because for the following reasons. 1. very 1st day am seeing i i observed its silver coating is going off. 2- even though i installed the latest software, its always prompt me to update/install the later update,. yes, i bought a 'new old-stock' phone - last year's model at the time of the sale. but it was a good value -- about $250 for an new-in-box, unlocked, 64gb, pure android device that should provide good service for an indefinite period of time. although i've used an ipad for several years and am familiar with the concept of apps and using a touch-screen display, i used to use a feature phone, so i'm not yet using my nexus as a 'power user' might. that stated, it has performed flawlessly from the initial activation with my carrier, and does everything it's asked to do. google sends out android os updates to nexus products first, so i'm assured of having the latest version without having to wait for another provider, such as samsung, who have to customize their versions of android before sending it to their phone's users. it's still early enough that there may be some features or functionality that falls short of my expectations, but i'm a fan at this point. if something significant comes up, i'll edit my review when that happens. for the record, i'm normally hesitant to give a full 5-star rating so early into the ownership history of any product i've purchased. but i've made an exception in this case, because i'm very impressed with the bang-for-the buck and initial performance of this device. hoping that it will continue to delight, as my experience with it grows .   ordered it for my brother in law, shipping was real fast and update to m6 software as soon as you turn it on he said he likes it very much .   excellent. everything great except the camera , the front camera it not good at nigth. i really wanted to like this phone. the battery life was good the screen was nice the phone was big. but that's to be expected when buying this type of smart phone. the problem was with it randomly rebooting all day long. i tried clearing the cache partitions and factory reset running in safe mode but it kept doing it. all google could say was contact the manafacturer of the phone we cannot help any further because it was purchased from amazon. wtf kind of answers is that it's brand new not a refurb not used brand new. so it was returned and thats the end of that story. sorry nexus i really wanted to like you .   good product! i bought two. excellent! brand new. great price .   great phone at a great price. i purchased this for my 21 year old grandson. he loves it .   great phone .   great phone .   i wish it has an led indicator  .   this phone was everything i wanted and more. got an amazing deal on this brand new nexus 6 and i couldn't pass it up. thanks again .   i absolutely love this phone. it is definitely a bit big but i knew that going in and was expecting it. it is fast, easy to use, beautiful screen, and a very attractive design. for reference i upgraded to this from an htc one m7 that i was fairly happy with besides the camera being absolute garbage. the camera on the nexus 6 is decent and gets the job done. takes relatively good pictures. overall this is a great phone and is worth the 300 dollars i paid for it .   why do i open the phone box to see a lot of dust as well as mobile phone screen protector on the phone screen film with bubbles. this phone is not someone drained away .   perfect perfect perfect! excellent phone and no hiccups. used it with at&t network with no problems and now using it with google fi which is fine but probably going back to at&t since fi for work is not working out (when connects to sprint network can't use data and be on a call at the same time which it is causing me some trouble). anyways, the phone feels great on my hand, use it with one hand all the time. updated to marshmallow the day i got it. my only complaint has been some light scuffs/ light scratches middle bezel/frame that i have no idea how it happen since i been super careful with it, making me think that it is very sensitive. i finally got my nillkin slim border bumper case, my dbrand skin, and temper glass all together, and the phone looks great. the charger charges the phone within a few hours which is very convenient. the battery rarely last a full 8 hours but i do use it for work and it is in constant use, plus the browser for work is a battery drainer so can't really blame the phone. after handling the phone for a few weeks now my sgs4 feels super tiny and don't see my self getting anything smaller unless it is a 5.7" phone but not less. the features in the phone are great with marshmallow and it is a good feeling knowing that you are running the latest thing and that you are getting the next update first (at least for a few years). definitely recommend this phone to anyone unless you have smaller hands and feel uncomfortable handling the phone with two hands. at the current price i will pick it over the newer flagships. excellent buy .   bad battery performance. nice phone but, too big to carry around .   i was excited when i received the phone. but as it was installing apps, it would get hotter especially on the screen. i tested the camera and it was okay but when i went back to watch the videos, i got a notice "cannot play video". other than that this phone is fast. i have an lg v10 and that phone takes better photos but when you're under sunlight, it is terrible as you'd have to turn the screen all the way up. for $250 "32gb model" you can't go wrong .   the best phone i've ever had .   phone works great with the exception of the default camera .   i love it .   this is the best phone i have ever owned, and one of the best value phones as well. at under $300, you're getting a phone that's faster than most other phones, is updated regularly by google (currently with android 6.0 marshmallow), and has a beautiful 1440p 6.0" screen. i originally got it because of the screen, but i really love the entire package. i have pretty big hands, so holding it is not a problem, but if you have small hands it might be like using a small tablet. i haven't run across an app that it can't run perfectly. the battery life is very good, i'm able to go from 11:30am to evening ending at around 30%, keep in mind the 1440p screen does drain battery life faster than a lower resolution one, but it is well worth it. i love this phone .   i love love love love my nexus 6! i can't even imagine using a phone with a smaller screen after being spoiled by this thing. it is the perfect size and fits in my pocket without any issues. my only complaint is with the google now launcher that you can't shrink the icons, but i downloaded zen ui launcher and fixed that issue. this is the perfect phone for the perfect price. i will only own nexus phones going forward. i also am switching to project fi at the end of the month. i highly recommend purchasing the nexus 6 or the nexus 6p .   awesome phone. i had it for two days and my experience was not good. it froze up (i got a bad one) and it was too big to comfortably carry, too awkward trying to meanuver the very wide phone it into any pocket, too wide to operate it with one hand (and i wear at a minimum large men's gloves). it looks great. bright screen. when it wasn't frozen it was fast with three gb ram. but the large phablet form factor made these positives irrelevant. i would not recommend this based on my experience. i went back to my slower but handy fire phone .   too big and too good. great phone and in my case it eliminates the need for tablet. very happy with my purchase .   this is a huge phone. it's fast. and coming from an s4, was a great upgrade .   a whole new experience with android, love it so far. love the phone couldn't be happier. we must have gotten a lemon. ordered this phone for my son and he loved it. this phone is super large, lots of great features, you can use it with any service provider - what not to like about it. however, gps as well as data synchronization would not work on our phone. read online, that this is a common issue, can happen with any android phone, and is caused by some hardware bug. will be sending it back and reordering .   love it! best phone ever. paired with google project fi, this is a great combination .   very good. best smartphone i've owned .   i gave this phone to my dad as a christmas present and he really likes it .   the only downside is that its too big and it barely fits in his pockets due to this reason he lost it once already but found it again thank god. we love the quality of the camera and the 64 gb it fits lots of info .   a good phone, i'm satisfied .   i'm giving it 4 stars because of the phone, which i have used before and i know is great; but to my specific experience buying it here, i would give no stars if i could. the phone arrived with several dents on its body and a lot of fingerprints all over the screen, like it had been manipulated a lot. i know it's not a big deal, since it works fine, but i'm used to higher standards from amazon. i'm almost sure it was a refurbished phone, when according to the description it was supposed to be brand new .   brand new - day one crashed 3 times. totally unreliable, couldn't even make it through day one. volume fluctuated up and down on calls for no reason, screen froze when placing a call, and this morning when receiving a call. both times required hard reboot, which took exceedingly long - longer than any other phone i ever owned. camera is abysmal .   met all my expectations. great all-round phone .   great phone. easy to use and great battery life .   i have had several nexus phones throughout the years. this phone is definitely the fastest in terms of processing and general moving around. it is a bit large, but you get used to it after a few days. i bought it on sale for $250. you cannot go wrong with this phone at that price. it's a steal. especially when you talk about timely updates straight from google and the latest android operating system. i will definitely stick with google nexus products from now on .   i tried for two weeks to get this phone to work reliably on lte with t-mobile. - speed test shows very different numbers, in the same location - anywhere between 0.5 mb - 12 mb download speed. - streaming music while driving was almost impossible, the stream disconnecting every 3-5 minutes - strength signal chart shows mostly orange and red, when according to t-mobile lte coverage map i should have excellent signal i opened a ticket with t-mobile to investigate this problem, and they said the problem is definitely not on their side. i tend to believe them because my old phone (nexus 5) works perfectly in the same places and same conditions. very disappointed in this phone. perhaps this particular model does not have all frequencies used by t-mobile .   this phone is amazing, has all the features i need and ask from the smartphone. it has very nice screen, with glorious colors. no hesitation in operations (i play mortal combat x), high stereo sounds, very good fast charger (included), very high photo quality. i feel like it's very mine. the only thing i don't like is flashlight which is not so strong as i expected and is white-cold colored -> i like yellow colored flashlight, but for them who likes this color and big screens, for such price nexus 6 is one of the best .   just received my package today and i am very pleased with it. swicthed from iphone as the price diffeence was impossible to ignore. i really love it .   the nexus 6 is one awesome phone. very fast phone, excellent battery life, excellent support for the latest version of android, and it's unlocked. using at&t, and works flawlessly. normal usage, i can get around a day and a half on a single full charge. watch out for a few apps that can drain your battery. this happened a week after having the phone. used gsam battery app to determine it was a bad app. removed the bad app and battery life is back to a day and a half. the only downside i could see about this phone is the screen size. i have an iphone 6 and had a htc one m7, and the nexus 6 made both of those phones feel extremely tiny. it's somewhat challenging to use the nexus 6 with one hand. but aside from that, the screen is clear, colors are vibrant and resolution is incredible. i would definitely recommend the nexus 6, especially since the prices have been slashed recently .   amazing phone. excellent price. it is very big but i'm getting used to it. i like to get unlocked phones that are a year or so old and put them on a prepaid plan. granted only had this phone a couple of days but really seems to be best phone i've owned. phone runs a ton of updates to get to marshmallow 6.0.1. group text works in the native app which is nice as prior phone required a 3p app for it to work. the two front speakers really make a big difference as well. nothing alarming about battery life yet as i've read the updates help that issue. i would recommend giving this phone a look. i haven't seen a better value out there currently. received on time and great buy .   exelent cellphone so very fluid. very very nice phone , i recommend any one to get it. very good. good performance, good design, good quarlity .   the phone is big, and sometimes not comfortable to hold with one hand, while the big screen also could give a fantastic visual experience. due to the big screen, the battery is not good as i expected. the quick charge is very useful, i won't need to worry about the battery .   hope is still so cheap $199. little oversized but great value for money .   i wanted to hate this phone because the nexus fanboys wouldn't stop talking about it, but it lives up to the hype. great camera, beautiful screen and design, decent battery life, and, of course, pure android. this is a steal at the prices being offered .   this is a very good phone, it feels great to hold and it isn't very thick. the battery is great too. and for this price its amazing .   killer device! motorola and google knocked this one clear outta the park .   price is intresting but has a manfacturing defect, volume decreses automatically when played in loud speaker,and frames struck when playing youtube in portrait mode, i googled it, it was clear that it is manfacturing defect, i need to replace it,waste of time. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/nexus/84nsai1btxc(volume issue). plenty of glitches, randomly closes various apps. after 6 months of ownership it stutters and is extremely slow. the internet is spotty when used with project fi. you have to go into the phone settings and set it to lte only every time it disconnects from wifi or you'll be connected to really poor internet. in general, my second disappointing motorola phone in a row and third disappointing android in a row .   it's a excelent phone for my fingers. is a great phone, batery life great, charges fast, really fast performance, sadly is not working the 4g lte in mexico, need to check with movistar what's going wrong. great phone for a great price. i was worried about the size but now my old phones look tiny by comparison and i can't imagine how i got by without the larger screen. the phone is fast and because it's a google phone it gets all the software updates very quickly. also, durable, i dropped this phone on the pavement the other day (no case) and it did take a chunk out of the plastic but did not break the screen or the phone. this was a great purchase and i cannot see how anyone could think otherwise. buy with confidence. ps - i received the us version of the phone and it works on t mobile with no problems .   at first this phone was great until after a few months the volume just start blowing for no apparent reason and the google nexus 10 has no idea why this happens and no one wants to take responsibility for fixing this issue now i can't return my phone do not buy this phone .   great android phone for anyone looking for a clean, android experience .   unfortunately, i'm oversea customer. i just got it recently and encounter problem immediately. the screen split half occasionally and found out the it is quite a problem for every user on the internet. i strongly believe it is factory recertified or known defective item. that's why they made a huge discount! i'm still finding a way to return the item. please contact me through my email to guild me. what a great phone. it's large but you don't notice it, and you can't beat the price for a great smartphone that's unlocked. don't buy it from a carrier they charge too much. this phone is my favorite phone i've owned. phone worked well for one and a half days. but then the phone turned off every time it went into sleep mode, even when the battery read 100% charge. apparently this is a widely known issue and no one really knows how to solve it. i spent an hour and a half with motorola going through the options that i already tried and that is on every android/nexus 6 message board. if you get lucky and get one that works it will probably be an amazing phone. amazon customer service on the return was not good. they had bad phone reception and we got cut off. when i called back they refused to connect me with the previous representative i spoke with even though he gave me his extension. in the time between purchase and return i had been forced to get a new debit card because chase is moving to new cards with chips in them so who knows when i will actually get my money since they are refunding a debit card that is no longer active(it was that or amazon gift card). oh and just getting a replacement phone was not an option .   dropped the ball here amazon .   it does everything i need it to, and best of all, it's it was brand new from amazon and motorola. no having to take someone's hand-me-downs like on swappa .   i love the phone itself. the size is perfect for me and great for people who do not put their phone in their pocket. i keep mine in my bag, so i don't need a small phone. i like the large screen, the large print and no fumbling trying to locate the phone in my bag. when waiting for an appointment, i enjoy reading newspaper articles, so the large screen makes it very comfortable. the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating was because there were a couple of minor problems i had to seek help to straighten out .   best phone i've ever purchased. got it when i got my project fi invite and so glad i did. pure android experience .   excellent product and value for mine. i was looking for a backup phone, and i just got this phone. (again) previously i have this nexus 6 and i missed a lot. for the price amazon is given this phone it is difficult to pass this deal. best of all, it has the latest android os, nice build and good specifications. pretty happy with this purchase. thinking in buying another .   this probably one of the best cell phones on the market. it's slightly larger than the samsung galaxy note or the iphone 6 plus. but despite it's large size, it's surprisingly easy to hold. it may not have a fingerprint reader like newer phones, but it makes up for it by being unlocked (able to use it with almost any carrier around the world). also, even though it's "older" than some of the phones you would find in stores, it's still fast and responsive. lastly, being a google nexus phone, it'll receive android updates and new features first. i really can't think of any negatives. did i mention it's water resistant? something the iphone or samsung can't say, lol .   great pure android phone for the current price. i used it on at&t first and they refused to activate hd voice (volte) option because it was not att branded. changed carrier to verizon for other reasons, and i had the option to activate any features it has from my account. works flawlessly on verizon with hd voice option and full lte data speed. battery is great with android 6.0.1 and it lasts for 2 days with normal use .   i bought this phone while it was on sale as a backup for my t-mobile branded note 5. the phone is actually bigger than my note 5 which means it's pretty massive, which honestly isn't a bad thing. people say "oh that phone is too big" but really when you get a big phone you get used to the size and can't go back to a smaller device, i can't even stand any iphones below the plus models and any android phone smaller than 5" is a joke to me. the screen is huge and the quad hd provides the same resolution of my other phone, plus a little extra real estate to use. i ended up returning the phone because i was comparing the actual coverage i got and for whatever reason my t-mobile branded note 5 got better service almost everywhere, possibly having something to do with what lte bands the phones supported. the nexus 6 had terrible service in the classrooms where i work at, little to no service while my note 5 had between 30% and 80% reception at all times. overall the phone was great to game on and the front facing speakers make wayyyyy more sense than bottom facing speakers, i have no idea why apple and samsung haven't figured that out after 10 years of smartphone manufacturing but apparently it's still a mystery to them. also i will add that my samsung gear s2 3g worked with the nexus 6 just fine while connected through bluetooth, but the remote connection features hardly worked and were very spotty with the device, my note 5 works perfectly with it but of course they are both samsung devices so go figure. not having an s pen also made me feel weird because i kept trying to pull it out of the nexus and it wasn't there. if you're looking for a cheap premium phone, buy it, if your a picky techie like me, you might want to get a model from a carrier on sale or pay more for exactly what you want .   first of, i always opposed the idea of having a phone bigger than the size of my hand, but i wanted to give this one a try and it was love at first sight. so let me point out few things: the phone is great full of amazing features when compared to my iphone, apple got a lot of catching up. the system firmware is a definite plus of course. the 13 megapixel camera has a great quality, pictures but it takes few seconds to stabilize the picture dual front facing speakers, makes one not need an external speakers, very loud, and sound is clear. the turbo charging is great but nexus isn't only phone with that feature. as a added bonus it can charge wirelessly ( if you have the qi charger) with that in mind, they are few kinks that i disliked, like the crashing of certain apps, or how it takes an unusual amount to turn on again. but for the price, the specs, the firmware, it is the best phone worth my money. great phone for the price. great phones for the price,large size screen .   so incredibly glad i got this phone. no more bloatware and limitations imposed by my carrier. significantly faster than my previous phone which was newer and supposedly a more feature-rich phone and a "flagship" phone. glad i got the larger capacity too. looking forward to a similar phone with a finger print sensor and updated hardware in the future. until then, i'll be loving this phone. as much as one could love a machine/inanimate object anyway .   i'm upgrading from an lg optimus l9 with a malfunctioning wifi connection that lg could never fix n lg keyboard app that erases words. this was also never addressed. but enough about that. i waited for the price of this phone to drop n when it did, i pounced. i've had it for six (6) months now n it hasn't disappointed. i find the pure android experience to be refreshing. no bloatware to deal with! in fact, when i popped in my t-mobile sim card, it offered to transfer all my apps including the t-mobile apps. i unchecked all the t-mobile apps, so i have no t-mobile clutter either. i'll be in mourning when it's time to upgrade n i can't find a comparable phone .   great price. i upgraded from a note 3. after going back and forth over several phones. i chose this at the $300 price. it's great and if you know the specs i'm not going to take stars off for lack of features. i just wish ir and external sd existed, but there are other phones that can be selected. but not at $300 .   brand new phone came 2 days ago and started overheating the first day. i'm looking for a solution but will likely end up asking to exchange it for one that doesn't overheat right out of the box. i love nexus and am loyal but i'm disappointed with this phone .   what can be written that hasn't already been said? let me try. this is my favorite version of all the nexus devices that i have owned. i was worried that it might be too large, but it is not much larger than other devices i have had, particularly ones that have otterbox or lifeproof cases on them. the nexus 6 is actually quite slim, making it also easier to fit into a front pocket. i was worried about the screen brightness, but this just hasn't been an issue. the screen is actually brighter and easier to read in the sun than both my nexus 7 tablet and my htc one m8 phone. the included turbo charger has been life changing however. i never knew how liberating the ability to throw my phone on a charger for 30 minutes to get 20-30% additional charge. that said, i am getting more than a day of use before needing to throw it on a charger. the battery life has been better than all my previous phones, and that includes several galaxy models and a few htc devices. i do wish there were more high quality cases and screen protectors available, but there are a few acceptable if not full coverage out there .   i am big fan of nexus phones, this i purchased during black friday offer for just $200. it beat all my expectations, battery life, performance  .   what not. very happy so far .   what a great phone! no complaints so far (except the stupid proximity sensor issue but thankfully most tempered glass screen protectors now take that problem into account) .   still one of the best phones ever made to date! have mine for over a year and now got this for my wife, at $249 it was a price i couldn't refuse :). could be an awesome phone if it worked! it reboots every 2-10 minutes randomly - no pattern. battery drains completely in a few hours - even when turned off. software updates continually fail. my research shows the rebooting problem to be a well-known one with no solution that i've yet found. am returning this. no solution in sight. no matter how great the display is, the speakers are and how snappy the processor is, it is entirely worse than useless if it isn't reliable! back to iphone for me .  i was really hoping .   best android phone i ever use .   bought this when it was on sale for a flat $200 and prime shipping. woah dang. this guy has everything: huge qhd display, 6 inch screen, great battery life (once i update to marshmallow and found a few rouge apps, it lasts a day and a half for me). what's really great about this particular model is the following: 1. carrier support. the big 4 are all here in their completeness. no bands forgotten 2. updates. i feel i'm at the cutting edge with software support. the only drawbacks are the typical ones about android in general. of especial note is that i bought another phone for my father in law (who had an iphone and didn't really take to it) and he really took to this phone. he loves it and uses it much more. sometimes wifi will lose its connection and only way to get back wifi is to reboot the device. very frustrating .   i will contact amazon to return this device .   great screen, good stereo speakers, performance is excellent. well worth it at current ($300 or so) prices .   got this on cyber monday. quite a deal. having been an iphone user for the last 6 years i'd say the android user experience is still not there yet comparing to ios. this being said, it doesn't stop me from calling the nexus 6 the best android phone hardware you can get for a little over 200 bucks. and when it's combined with the latest android 6.0, it really demonstrates the superb system capability google is offering. in general i call this phone an all around balanced smart device. it's supposed be a humongous device but in reality is surprisingly easy to hold and carry around because of the ergonomic design. i do need to take it out while driving though as i don't want to bend it in my pocket. the 6" screen and dual front facing speakers make it an ideal mobile entertaining solution. youtube videos and games are just better on this big device. i have to mention about the core benchmarking when reviewing any communicator device, its performance in both cellular and wifi connections. the fact that this model was actually developed by motorola makes the telecom side of this phone very convincing. it actually outperformed my wife's iphone 6 plus in both lte and 802.11 speed tests. i guess the bigger size also helps to optimize the device's multi antenna performance. there are whole lot of good things about this phone. i'm not gonna list all of them here. instead i want to talk about a few things that i really don't like about this device: 1. battery life is poor, which you don't expect from such a big device (and therefore massive battery?). this kills a lot of fun especially when i intended to use it as a 'multimedia on the go' electronics. turbo charge tries to help but isn't really helpful. 2. you will need a protective case, preferably a thin and clear one cause you don't want to hide the quality feel of the device. not doing so, you will hate the dirty sticky marks on the back lid in no time. the marks are not permanent, it can be wiped off with some effort, it just ruins the neat design of the device. 3. camera performance is average. pictures tend to show a yellowish hue especially at low lighting. so seems something still can be improved on the white balance side. focusing is slow and noise is high at low lighting. and the panorama stitching performance varies compared to ios. so far i've been using this as my daily driver. i still looked back at my iphone 5s from time to time as everything is nice and smooth on it except the screen size. maybe the latest iphone 6/6s plus still hold the leads in almost every aspect, but for 200ish bucks and the stock google ecosystem experience, this is a no brainier .   and you google it, it's a known lollipop issue .   good phone but long delay in delivery. i bought the cloud white for my wife. after about one week normal using, the speaker suddenly crackled. i contacted amazon customer service have it replaced. while i was excitedly opened the package, installed all the apps, registered imei and paid the swapping fee. after all those i took out sim card tray, put sim card in it, but can not insert the tray all the way into the slot. the phone which i want to send back has no problem with the sim card slot. i also tried to use the same sim card tray on my classmate's nexus 6, no such a problem. contacted amazon have it replaced again. the second day after the request was submitted, i received a letter from amazon, warning me that my account will be closed if it happens again. " however, you seem to have had an unusually high rate of problems in your account history. we'll evaluate each account on a case-by-case basis to determine if additional action is necessary, including closing the account.". i had a one us one before this and sadly was a disappointment , with the battery dying too fast. this phone however had taken everything thrown at it and world like a champ. google flagships never cease to amaze fast os with no bloatware , fast updates, super good price, good camera which was kind of a surprise to me for nexus devices were not known for it, vibrant screen, good sound, world great with a chromecast. great shipping speed as well .   fast shippong, really nice cell phone! i have never tried android phone before, but it was amazingly good and easy to use. the size is a little bit large however you will get used to it .   pretty big, excellent battery. i love the specs on this phone, and it's gorgeous. however, buyer beware, this phone is completely breakable. my husband had one in a rugged case, not an otter box type case, but one with padded edging, and with less than a 3 foot drop on the bedroom floor, the glass screen shattered completely. if you are even remotely clumsy with your phone at all, consider buying an otterbox style case for this phone, as it will break your heart to destroy it, since it's largely no longer available .   i love this phone, although a bit expensive than black friday. love the phone. purchased 4 for the family. the whole experience with amazon.com was great, the device is wonderful and exactly as described. it works excellently here in saudi arabia. i recommend that for all of my friends .   screen is fantastic! a great camera. all day battery for $ 250 this is a huge bonus .   this phone is freaking awesome! i love that it is already on marshmallow (android 6) and the fact that it comes with straight up android and none of this bloatware nonsense. my wife uses this phone. i have a samsung galaxy s6 and i am envious of this phone, lol! we are using this with cricket and everything is perfect .   great everything if you are coming from a s3, moto g 1, 2, or 3rd gen. it gets android updates frequently .   i totally love this phone! at first, i was unsure because of its huge size! but it took me just a day to get used to it. i love the design and features! :). nice phone .   this phone has a lot of positives going for it, as you've read in the four and five star ratings. however, this phone was not suitable for me because of these reasons: 1. poor battery life. i don't use my phone much, mostly text several times a day and maybe a handful of calls. i lose at lease half my battery if not more during that time. not acceptable. 2. echo during phone calls. i sometimes hear an echo (i can here myself talk a half second after i've spoken. quite annoying.) 3. questionable sound quality during calls. everyone sounds muffled, and i guess i do to. i had two people ask me if i had a cold because i sounded different. (no, i didn't have a cold.) 4. slippery. the back of the phone is very slippery. hard to hold when you combine the slipperiness with the oversized phone. 5. size. i had to try it for myself, and yes, this phone is so big it's unusable for me. live and learn. cool looking phone. if you have bigger hands and don't mind constant battery recharging and sounding congested, go for it .   i bought this on sale for $250 plus tax (missed the black friday sale of $199) for my son. it took about an hour to go through several upgrades in the firmware but i finally got it to the marshmellow. the screen is really nice and the phone is fast. i like the fact that this is running stock android and i can't think of any brand new phone for $250 that can beat the specs of this phone .   cheaper than any other seller. and good quality .   this phone is huge but still fits into pocket with no problem, the camera is very slow to start especially the front camera, it either freezes or just takes awhile to load whenever i activate the front camera. a lot of apps drags especially instagram video, it doesn't play it very well compare to my oneplusone. the battery of the phone is running out in a 2 hours. the phone heats up. its a lost cause. i need to buy another phone now. $200 down the drain. thanks. this is my second nexus 6 (64gb). i ordered my first one in september and was so i'm impressed with it, when i saw it on sale for this ridiculous low price, i had to get another. i use my first one with project fi and i plan to use this one as a standalone gps/entertainment unit with the project fi data only sim .   i like it .   when i first got it it would regularly restart on it's own, not enough for me to notice a trend for several months. now it'll activate the camera on it's own. everything works great except those two random things that happen on their own, mostly just a short inconvenience .   its pluses: it's a google phone and it says it all - you always get the freshest and newest android in no time. good overall performance and 3gigs of ram. you can easily open 10 desktop tabs in google chrome - all of them will be active. stereo speakers with clean sound. amazing display. good cellular/wi/fi reception, universal lte. the ability to wake up when you take it from the table. its minuses: what sucks about the original nexus 6 though - is its pathetic battery life. when left unattended it wastes battery like crazy (in battery stats it's indicated as "idle") - never seen anything like that before. the phone lasts only about five days even if you don't use it all. it allows only about 6 hours of active usage. its oled display is amazing with deep blacks however when brightness is set to very low levels the screen becomes reddish. it's a known issue though. i owned a nexus 5 and what i've noticed about the nexus 6 is that its ui responsiveness and speed are measurably slower however i wouldn't call the phablet laggy. other thoughts: the camera is strictly so so - its more or less unusable under low lighting conditions. my next phone will be a nexus 6 something based on snapdragon 820. i will skip the nexus 6p. bezels could be quite narrower .   purchased this phone over the thanksgiving holiday for $199.95 and love it this nexus phone. i brought 2 more for my family member for $249.00. it is well made and i was allowed to upgrade to google latest operating system marshmallow 6.01. the battery life is great compared to my samsung s4 and s5. i don't have to charge it every day! the only negative is that the phone is a little bulky. other than that i have no complained. this phone is compatible with att, verizon, sprint, tmobile and ringplus. currently, i have project fi with the phones. huge phone. defiantly need 2 hands for a lot of usage (and i have big hands). super fast, good camera, nexus! at $250 it's a no-brainer .   i wish i would have bought 2 .   the best android phone i ever have. battery life is great with android 6.0 update .   excellent phone. brilliant performance. great battery life. regular updates from google. well worth the price. the size appears huge at first, especially if you come from a smaller phone, but you get used to it. however, note, the screens can be very iffy. i ordered two, one for me and one for my wife. the screen brightness between the two varied greatly; we replaced my wife's with another one that has a brighter screen. also, note the screens may have "burn in" or "dark spot". download a screen tester app on your phone and view it on a full white background. if you have one of these flawed screens, don't be afraid to ask amazon for a replacement .   for $300 awsome pure android experience phone with killer specs just got mine has official android 6.0.1 (downloaded not out of the box) 4k video recording buttery smooth cel highly recommend it to anyone .   ps came with turbo charger 12v. =). very good .   they really should add more stars for this phone. i've wanted this phone since i saw a review of it against the iphone 6 plus. at $700.00, it was out out of my range .  when it went on sale for $300.00, i jumped on it .  have always had a thing for motorola since it was my first .  yup, that old grey brick we all had 25 years ago .  well, not you youngsters but those of you with gray hair will know exactly which phone i'm writing about. google and motorola spared no expense in putting this thing together .  it is loaded and i mean loaded. comes with lollipop but as soon as you add a sim card, you'll be able to upgrade to marshmallow 6.0.1  .  one of only a handful of phones that will work with any sim card .  k, gotta go play with my new phone. hope this helps .  love ya later. i had an old iphone 4s, it was slow. i found this huge phone for only 299$, it's perfect for me. is fast, is big (maybe too big) and works perfectly. love it .   great phone .   awsome phone. made the move from my old iphone 4s to the 64 gb nexus. at first i thought it was a little on the big size, but after 4 days of using this i'd never go back to the iphone. nexus is a steal at $299 .   great product, good deal. great phone, all around .   actually i loved it - or at least the smart part of the smartphone with wifi. i had to wait 2+ weeks to activate on my verizon prepaid plan because otherwise i'd lose my payment that was in my current account. so i used it with wifi for all kinds of apps - just no texting or phone. i liked the responsiveness, i liked the size, i liked the camera and the screen. didn't come with the tool to open the sim tray, which needs a smaller thingee than the end of a standard paperclip. when i went to verizon, they put in the sim, changed me over from a 3g account (motog 1st gen) to a 4g account, took a new payment and activated the phone. didn't work. no sound on dialing out. no sound for incoming call. no sound on the phone at all, although streaming through wifi had good sound. restarted the phone. nothing. immediately switched back to old account and old phone (which is trying to die), but that meant i lost 5 days payment on the old account because they restart the prepay account on the reactivate date. i get a $10 credit that i cannot get a refund on, can use for data but cannot use on the plan unless i pay all but the exisiting $10 on the next (new) payment date. so i have to turn off autopay, pay the new payment in feb., then put back autopay. what a hassle for a great phone. and the big question is, does it have a microsd slot in with the sim or not. verizon's info on the nexus 6 says it does not have a microsd slot, google's hardware tech info on it says it does have a microsd slot. when we held the microsd up to the sim tray, the msd was wider than the sim tray. so what's that about? does it have a hidden one somewhere? and now i can't return it through no fault of amazon - because the snowstorm over ice on the ground, etc., this past weekend knocked over a tree near my front fence, leaving trunk and branches everywhere on the fence, gate and sidewalk, with the base on my side of the fence, it will be 3 or more days before the city gets around to cutting it back to the fence and hauls it off, so neither i nor anybody else can get in or out from street to my front porch, including post office and ups! so there goes more $$ and i can't buy another until i return this and get the refund! maybe i'll just go back to basic flip phone or something, hahahaha. i have a few of those in a drawer somewhere. (;-0. it is a very good smartphone and looks beautiful ,i like it very much  .   best. i love this phone. big, big step up from the old galaxy note 2 i had. love it .   nice product. best phone i've ever owned. i've owned an iphone 4,5, and a few samsung galaxys and this phone blows them all out of the water .   as delivered and used on att with 5.1.1, the phone was great but the battery life stunk. after manually upgrading to 6.0 (no thanks to at&t here) it's excellent all the way around. i think literally my only complaint is i wish they had managed to get a good fingerprint sensor (was supposed to be on the back where the moto m is) for it. oh and the lack of an sd slot, but such is life on high end phones today. i upgraded from an lg g3 which already had a high res screen, but the amoled is vastly superior, and i like the extra real estate. the phones responsiveness was a big step up too. going to switch to project fi when at&t raises the legacy unlimited data rates in february .   fantastic phone! very happy with it .   awesome phone, super fast and supports quick charge. this made me switch from my iphone to android. totally worth it for using on the google project fi network .   att customer here .  purchased this 64gb nexus 6 in the daily deal. brand new phone .  went from g4 to this and must say its better in my opinion. took out of the box, skipped sim card insertion and connected to wifi. within 30 minutes was upgraded to android m 6.0.1. no issues .  lte is perfect, calls excellent, wifi is stronger with this than the g4. apps transferred seamlessly except those only optimized for lollipop which for me were 2 useless games. extremely fast os with qi charging working excellent. even with the supcase unicorn beetle pro as the case and techmatte 3 coil qi charger, this phone charges quicker than the stock charger and i felt no excess heat from the unit or phone. definitely recommend. initially i really liked this phone and it performed well on verizon's network. but after a couple of days after receiving my nexus 6, my unit started to overheat really bad. changing location setting to battery save mode stopped it from overheating. after solving this problem i thought i was in the clear and i could enjoy this phone. i was completely wrong. the next day the phone started loosing complete connection with verizon's network. even in areas with really good verizon coverage. the phone would just cycle between "no network connection" to "1x" to "3g". mostly displaying no network connection. i then put my sim in my old verizon iphone and it connected to the network right away and had no issues. thinking it might be a bad sim card, i went to my local verizon store to see if they could help me with my issue. they were very nice and replaced my sim card with a new one and changed a couple of settings on my verizon account and on the nexus 6 itself. on the nexus 6, they switched the phone from the global network setting to the lte/cdma setting. this solution worked for like 12 hours and then i was faced with the same network connection error problems. i called verizon's tech support and they suggested i turn off the advance calling feature 1.0 in settings. that did not work. so i let the phone sit for a couple of hours and then the phone mysteriously connected back to verizon's network and i was getting good lte reception and everything worked. thinking that the problem was officially fixed, i went to bed and plugged the phone into the charger. the next morning i woke up and picked up the nexus. it was disconnected again from the network and would not connect. at this point i decided to just reset the phone to factory condition before i went off to school. after completing the reset process, the phone connected to verizon's network right away and worked for like 5 minutes. at this point i had enough and decided to go back to my old iphone. i can't switch cell phone carriers because verizon is the only carrier that provides decent service in my neighborhood. sprint only has 3g service in my neighborhood, at&t's service does not penetrate inside houses well, and t-mobile's service is just flat out bad here. i guess it is just best to buy an official verizon supported phone for the time period. i loved the aesthetics of the nexus 6, i just wish it could have worked out in the long run .   excellent features at half price compared to other brands. screen and sound quality were my priority which are best .   the phone is not 64gbits has they pretend it was a 32gbits. great phone, i bought it on black friday. large screen makes it easy to see things. that being said the glass is very fragile, it broke a couple weeks after i bought it. a relatively minor drop shattered the glass, which i had to replace. lots of processing power. there is an issue that i have experienced with the screen after i updated the phone. the screen blacks out during a call and can't be brought back up till you finish your call. i read it might have something to do with a proximity sensor. that is very annoying .   the phone itself is fantastic. ordered a 64 gb, but instead received a 32 gb phone .   nice phone but seems like prone to damage easily if fell .   i thought it would be a huge upgrade coming from the galaxy s4 from at&tt considering that this has a faster processor, more ram and none of the samsung/att bloatware. sadly, it's only slightly faster. the front facing stereo speakers are much better than the rear facing single speaker that i'm used to except that they are kinda quiet. also the screen is very easily broken. i have never broken a screen before. i dropped this phone from less than 2 feet above the ground and it shattered. i've dropped my past samsungs several times with barely a scratch. i will definitely be going back to samsung next time .   i get defect phone .  very sad. got on sale - great .   amazing device .   so sad it's not available any more :(. very fast device with new android6.0.1 .love it. big maybe too big. i purchased this phone on black friday at $200.00.i m very happy.the image, the sound ,the battery life and the wireless connection (4glte ) are excellent. i love the size to .   i couldn't bring myself to pay full retail when it released, but for half that, i couldn't pass it up. this is the best phone i've had. stereo speakers, good camera (contrary to some naysayers), fantastic screen, and great battery life add up to one great phone .   great phone. bought three of these for myself and my siblings. two of them works fine but the third overheats and now it won't even come on. there seems to be a line that looks like a crack on the inside of the phone. its never fallen or been dropped or anything. very upsetting and my brother is so disappointed .   here is my first impression, the device is getting hot, when i start using , it's like taking phone out of oven, it's getting heat very quickly, like when we do heavy operation. it seems amazon sent me defect peace. in my experience this has been my best and favorite phone that i have had so far. size is a bit of an issue but after a week, i don't think i could go back to anything smaller. i'm an average 6' male, and i don't think my hands are huge, the size is now fine for me. although it will not fit like other phones in your shirt pocket, you will be able to have a better time being on the internet. typing texts is awesome due to the screen size. battery life can me an issue, but changing settings like email frequency for syncing helps significantly. marshmallow 6.0 took my battery life from less than a day to almost two days. with 6.0.1 batter life was horrible as in less than 6 hours. after changing things like email syncing i'm back to two days. i needed wifi calling and i also want updates right away and i get that with the nexus. i had the motto x pure edition and had to return that due to lack of wifi calling even though that phone is physically capable of wifi calling, it is unclear if and when they will enable it. with the nexus 6, no problem. a huge plus is the amoled screen, reminds me of my old galaxy 2, which was the phone i would reminisce about and that was due to it being an amoled as well. everything else seems to work better such as bluetooth connectivity is stronger. last phones i have had were htc one, and a nexus 5 and with some bluetooth headphones i would get cutout and choppy sound at times, no problems again with this nexus. fast charge is good too .   nice smartphone but actually falls flat in terms of call quality, which is what we buy these products for. even turned all the way up, call volume is abysmally low. i often have to tell people to shout so i can hear them. google this problem and you'll see that it's widespread but google has done nothing to address it. i'm generous in offering 3 stars .   great phone for the price, great camera and screen, speakers sound great, can't go wrong with this one. why this phone is bad: - both buttons at the side, making it very difficult to screenshot - once out of battery charge, it takes 20-30 minutes to charge before it can come back up - big, heavy, having trouble with most mobile holders in car and selfie sticks. bad bad bad .   upon it's initial release i wasn't too excited about this phone, not because it was under performing or anything, but just because of it's launch price. however in just a few months the price of the n6 started to plummet from 650, to 500, and in under a year to 350. it currently goes on sale for 250, or even 200 for those that were lucky to grab it before it went out of stock during bfriday. the nexus 6 at it's current price point is the single best phone you can possibly purchase, there is absolutely no reason to go with any other phone unless you are absolutely adamant on having a current gen flagship, and even then, the nexus 6 competes without faltering much compared to the s6 and the note 5 and even the 6p. yes, it's an objectively inferior phone to those mentioned but the performance scaling is almost non existent. do yourself a favor, if it goes on sale and you're wondering if you should buy it, don't. just buy it, if not for you, make a gift. it's a monster of a phone, make someones day .   update- no heating issues now except when charging. wifi still an issue when restarting. great phone except these 2. bought this with much hope but already facing issues with few hrs of use 1) heating too much while charging or even using you tube for 10 mins 2) wi-fi taking long time to connect after restarting the phone (close to 10 mins). same wi-fi network connects through other phones in less than a minute. not sure if i got a used phone. anyone having same issues? thanks .   excellent phone. ~$280 well spent! enjoy all android updates which is the priority for me .   i love this phone. yes, the screen is a bit warmer than other screens but i like it. i don't think it's too yellow at all. i love how responsive the phone is and the fact that it is unlocked so i can use it easily overseas. i don't think i'll need a new phone for a long time .   i got this phone on dec 31st. really excited. amazing reviews and all. i took the expected measures to maintain my phone in the best conditions ( adjusted brightness, unused apps unninstalled, no overnight charging) battery used to last 17-20 hrs (max 30% charge) . now 4 months later (4/4/2016) my phone's battery barely holds up to 10 hours ( 25% charge). overnight it goes down 15%, all apps closed, no backup running .   this 64gb beastly phone has everything i need. i have large hands, so love it. i wish it was a bit lighter but that would be the 6p, which cost much more than this one. out of the box, it needed several lengthy updates, i think because it was climbing up to android 6.0 .   after 2 months with this phone, no problems have arise so far. gotta love android 6.0. i love this phone. i got this phone in nov '15, and i like the phone. i feel this is best among the ones we have in the market for this price. but only problem i have is with volume control buttons and power button, they are very close to each other. and only way to reduce/increase volume is go to the buttons, no privilege to control on the screen(else go to settings and change it). i get battery for almost a day or around 16 hrs(could be due to some apps running in the background). apart from that i like the phone .   like it, works fast and nice, and i got marshmallow 6.0.1 and that's very good. though, the battery doesn't last much .   it concerns me a lot because it is non-removable and i want this phone to last at least 2 years. i don't think it can be possible with this issue. not satisfied with it .   absolutely nothing to hate this phone. let me list all the pros first pros: - qhd amoled screen - stereo speakers - spill resistant - above average camera with optical image stabilization (latest gen nexus devices lacks these) - more memory - quickcharge 2.0 - best battery life with marshmallow update. thanks to doze feature. cons for the price i paid for this device i am happy with the phone. but i can list these as general cons - too large and heavy. not for compact phone lovers. - no black color option - no 64-bit processor here comes my review: after i used galaxy s4 i fell in love with the beautiful super amoled from samsung and after loosing i got a htc one m7. where i had lcd screen but the stereo speakers made me use it much longer. but when i tried to upgrade i was kind of hoping that my next device should have both amoled screen and stereo speakers. my immediate choice was nexus 6p and i went for it. but except for the lightning fast fingerprint sensor and sleek design nothing else impressed me much. camera was too good for stills but i had a horrible experience with videos. so returned it and went for nexus 6 in thanksgiving flash sale and no regrets till now. right from the awesome price i paid and the fast delivery from amazon this device ticked all the boxes. massive 6 inch qhd amoled screen and stereo speakers stood out. as soon as i powered it on i got the marshmallow update with latest security fixes for the device which is very rare with the previous contract phones i used. standby lasts for days and it gives decent screen on time for a qhd screen device. i do miss the fingerprint sensor but i can live without it till the nexus releases. no full black color option available so i bought a diztronic matte black case and dbrand black skin. for the first one week i found the device to be huge but got used to it later. still its tough to use with one hand. currently its selling for 299$ which is still a very good price for a google device. i bought another phone for a friend 2 weeks later and he is also happy with the phone .   love this phone, i have very large hands was able to palm a full size basketball at age 12 if that gives you an idea, and the second i opened the box and put this phone in my hand i knew it was a great fit for me! i am coming from an lg g3 that i picked up on launch day back in summer of 2014 so this was a nice upgrade. sure its already over a year old but for $249 it is still a great upgrade and going from a 5.5 inch screen to 6 inches makes a huge difference! i love the built in wireless charging and the reliability of using pure andriod. i highly recommend that as soon as you get it out of the box you do not insert a sim card and rather connect to your homes wifi and do a series of updates, for me it was about 3 updates to get it from 5.0 to marshmallow 6.0.1 i recommend you do this as i have heard if you try updating with a carrier sim card in it sometimes you will get carrier specific patches which will ruin the pure android experience. i am using a spigen clear back case on it and the phone still is not as big as a iphone 6 plus with a case on it even though it has a much larger screen! this is because iphones have ridiculously large bezels which most android phones have been able to trim down. at this price buy one without hesitation, i mean common, 3 months ago it was still $499 directly from google! good luck. product was sold saying it support lte speed, but i am getting only 3g internet speed, same location, friend sitting next to me he is getting 4g, same carrier and type of sim card, only difference he is using iphone 6. great phone, still using it .   i've had the nexus 6 for almost 3 months now and there are many good aspects of the phone, such as the screen is fantastic, the performance of the phone has been great and having straight android without bloatware is very nice. the call and speaker volume are very good and louder than many others i've heard. the one problem i've been having is with the hand off from wifi or lower data speeds to each other. many times when i leave my house on wifi and go outside, the phone does not automatically switch to lte or any data service. there is absolutely nothing you can do except reboot the phone, which takes a few minutes. i've tried airplane mode, turning off data and back on, searching providers, resetting other data settings, but nothing works. i've called motorola and they had me go through a few things, but the problem still exists. on forums online, others are having the same problems and have concluded that it is the phone, not your provider. if i was still under the 30 days from purchase, i would return the phone and get something else. for now, i deal with it and will have to call motorola again .   i have been using android smartphones ever since i started using smartphones. my previous smartphone was samsung galaxy s3 which i used for more than three years. i found the nexus 6 to be extremely large compared to s3. but i really like it because it's easier to read books and browse internet. after upgrading to marshmallow the charge profile really improved and it lasts for at least a day even if i keep gps, wifi and lte turned on the entire day. the updates are also available sooner as expected .   this is the most annoying piece of sh-t of a phone i ever had to put my hands on. android lolipop is garbage compared to the older kitkat. everything in this phone is google garbage. you can't open an app, listen to a song, dial a # without running into the word google. whatever you try doing on this phone, any app you try to open you have to log into a google account. i know this is google's own creation evil phone but come on. let's be real. i don't wanna sign in, i don't want you to know what my location is and most importantly i don't want you to know who i am. let me use the phone dial feature the way i want to, let me listen to music the way i want to. i don't give a sh-t about hangouts or google play. i want to use the phone the way i am used to with the older much better kitkat android without interference. has google taken over the world? what the hell .   i don't like this phone neither its new android version one bit. there is no freedom using this phone. i tried to install the game solitaire and as soon as i opened the app i was bombed with ads and crapomercials running on the screen. what the hell .   i just wanted to play a game and not have to read your bullsh-t ads. this is inhumane. this is what the corporate google does to people who use their nexus phones. this is terrorizing phone users. i am fed up and will be sending this phone back. no more boogle, croogle, shtoogle. i want a normal phone. i want to have a normal music player on my phone, a normal browser and a normal dialer. the simple and practical things. stick your hangouts and your chrome in your as-s. pure android experience? my asss .   this is the worst android platform. i even contemplated signing for project fi. hell no .   i've been terrorized enough by simply exploring the phones features without even putting a sim card in. the only good thing about this phone is the speed at what the information is processed. it is fast. but that's it. the huge size does not make it useful. i believe the phone was designed large so you could read the bullsh-t ads better which will eventually get in your way while you do simple tasks, something google is good at. i hate google, i hate their nexus phone, i hate these bureaucratic parasites. i want a simple life and i need a practical phone. therefore i'll be sending it back. thank you but, no, thank you .   i bought this phone on black friday for $260. for this price it's easily among the best phones i've ever used. it is very large but, using it for a few days you'll get used to it. if you have small hands, this phone is likely is not for you though. i definitely think this worth at least $500 .   love it .   been a great device .   once you get used to the size, you'll love it. it's great for youtube and videos .   great phone. being a 6" phone, it's almost a tablet. it's comfortable to use with two hands, but even with my large hands i find it difficult to use it with just one. still, the screen's beautiful, and everything runs very well. battery life is also good, as i've no issues getting through a full day on one charge. i listen to music all day at work, and read books on it on my breaks, but i've always got around 60% battery left when my work day ends. that's pretty solid .   good good good. nice case~~. the phone is having problem with the top speaker. there is some sort of hissing/crackling sound that comes from top speaker. made a mistake buying nexus 6, so please be careful before you purchase it .   good cell phone shell, good quality, good use of mobile phones. i love moto phones and have three. this nexus 6 is not as responsive as the moto g. perhaps i received a defective one. . the screen size is perfect for me. i prefer big phones as i'm less likely to lose them. it has become more responsive as i have learned to use it. probably will get a galaxy s6 next tine around. after using this for a bit longer, i'm happy with it. i have a dead samsung s6 which i also liked, but it does not like moisture .   great phone at great price .   it's a stunning phone. feels good in hand. i ordered it from amazon when it's in stock for $250 for the 32g model. however when i opened the box the phone looks like it's been opened. the screen protector has dust underneath. i turned on the phone and immediately tried it out. the volume of the phone is not working right. i turned on a youtube video and the volume would randomly fluctuate and got loud and soft without me changing anything. it's going back to amazon tomorrow .   a great phone at a great price. i ordered this phone because my current nexus 6 had the screen shattered and the battery life was failing. the day after i ordered the new nexus 6 my old one died after being dropped from about 15 feet. i didn't opt for faster shipping when i ordered the new phone but luckily for me the seller sent it 2-day prime! i can't rate this seller high enough. also, the phone was exactly as described, unlocked, new in the original box .   fast and crisp display, speakers are so-so. the curve back is not good design for my magnetic car mount. falls off when going over bumps .   phone's really nice. design is ok. speed on 4g is on point. ðÿ‘ bought it on black friday. awesome phone. pairs with the project fi plan well. best phone plan i've ever paid for .   excellent phone. huge screen and fast, robust .   i got this phone on special the week of xmas. a steal at $249. for the most part i really like it. the screen is very bright and vibrant, and definitely big enough to really enjoy videos or reading content. it's plenty fast and responsive, and gets better than average battery life. but it is a nexus phone. for some that is the greatest .   pure android. i admit that it is very nice having no carrier-added bloatware, and it's great to be unlocked so that i can take the phone to any carrier. but there are some things i miss as far as customizations and features that makers like lg and samsung add to their devices. bottom line is, if you want stock android, and a very dependable phone .   you can't go wrong with the nexus 6. very good device for what it is .   woah. this thing can do everything! minus one star because there's no dongle hole to put my maneki neko charm .   i saw lot of negative reviews for this phone. this phone came on sale for $249.99 (lowest was $200). my experience does not differ from others where this phone has some bugs. however for the price and unlocked feature and android 6.1 (phone upgrades os from 5.0 to 6.1 or 6.2 automatically ) os, makes it less bug free. for e.g. you cannot use a standard screen protector, i had to return one because proximity sensor (hardware) does not work properly with screen protector. i give a 5 stars just because this is damn powerful phone and signal reception is also looking good. snap of a second, things get done. battery is reasonable. touch screen sensitivity and camera are looking good. i got some nice photos even in the dark. videos downloaded very quick, wi-fi performance is really great. i got about 800mb of marshmallow os (6.0) downloaded and installed in less than 15 minutes. 13 mega pixel camera (only in 4:3 mode - 16:9 would be 9.7 mp) and 2.1 mp front camera compliments video chat in a better way. preloaded with google apps which are really great. overall i am very satisfied with the phone .   the oled screen is very yellow. and top 1/4 of the screen is red-cast. and camera failed after a week. terrible quality. i am very disappointed .   big phone with lots of memory and pretty decent cameras. battery life is decent (1 day with average usage) and so far has worked great. happy with the purchase. this is an excellent phone and i'm very tempted to give it 5 stars, but i think the missing features are a bit too key for that. i was really still happy with my galaxy s5, except that it was a verizon banded phone and was having trouble finding towers in new locations after i switched to t-mobile. first, the good: 1) pretty! 2) fast. 3) large battery. i don't use my phone much and normally have 80%+ left by the end of the day. even browsing for 2-3 hours straight used about 25%. 4) no bloatware. a battery saving app i installed said the t-mobile account app was draining the battery. i uninstalled it and no more battery drain. 5) 32 gb storage doesn't seem like much, but with no bloatware, it's actually plenty so far. 6) wireless charging. when i tried qi charging with the samsung oem wireless back cover and my galaxy s5, it ran really hot. i haven't noticed that with this phone. i have a tylt vu charger, which is nice. 7) i have tiny little kid sized hands and i don't have a problem holding it. 8) getting all the os updates right from google. it spent about the first 24 hours i had it installing updates. the bad: 1) no sd card. 2) no removable battery. 3) usb 2.0 only. 4) no fingerprint sensor. 5) the email app has been merged with the gmail app in marshmallow and it has a bug and can't connect to my hotmail (luddite here!) account. and the outlook app just isn't very good. the weird: 1) no notification light. 2) curved back - makes it feel nice in the hand, but it doesn't lay flat on a table. 3) the glass is curved such that a screen protector looks really crappy. i've opted to go without, which makes me really nervous. 4) in order to add a custom ringtone or notification, you need to connect the phone to a pc and copy the mp3 file into a specific folder on the device. you can't just long press on the sound file and get an option to set as ringtone, as with other android phones. overall, i'm happy with the phone, though .   wish i had gotten the black friday deal, but $249 is still a steal for 32gb. fast and prompt updates, since it is a nexus phone. can't decide if i want to keep this phone or my note 5 as my daily driver. great phone and deal .   i bought it for family in india, and they can't be happier with the device. it's unlocked, works flawlessly. it has awesome display and loud sound, plus it has latest android version from google, it's perfect. the only disappointment is the front camera, knowing the specs, can't complain but in selfie days, it's a downside .   working great right out of the box, brand new. got it during the holiday special. very very happy. will always stick with nexus line. enjoy it if you got one. my cell phone carrier could not unlock the phone for service. very nice. amazing phone for the price. the screen is much larger than normal, but after a week, you get used to it. very fast and snappy processor, and bright screen. highly recommend for those looking for a flagship phone at a mid-tier price .   died after 3 months. xt1103,i love u .   my phone just went off and now it doesn't come up. brand new, only one month use! i would like to get an answer on this, as the phone is brand new and it is not working .   first off, i can say that this would be a fantastic phone if not the the defects in the unit i received, which had trash under the screen protector straight out of the box. the top speaker hisses whenever the phone is performing tasks (this becomes louder as the battery becomes low; the top speaker will also produce crackling noises when playing media at any volume. this is not software related as i updated the device to android 6.0.1. aside from the detects, the phone is great. large, beautiful display. very zippy processor. great photos. pure android experience, no bloatware. i am returning this phone for a refund .   definitely love the android experience. it's fast and fluid. i love how everything ties together. i love the section that gives you hints about japanese because i'm living in japan. the screen is big and that might be a downsize for some but i just use it like a tablet that doubles as a phone. i can't use it one handed because it's way too big but it's not a big problem for me to use 2 hands. the front facing speaker is really good. i was an iphone user so the whole android camera took a lil getting used to. overall i can't really find much to complain but everyone has their own preference. if a big device that seems unwieldy is not your cup of tea then you should skip this. if you're too ingrained into the whole apple ios scene then you should skip this. at 250 this is a steal .   speaker, screen, size, operating system, premium build, and awesome camera! everything you could want in a phone. i love this phone, buttery smooth, great 4k video, and just you get alot of fone for a low price. best value. if you're on the fence about getting this phone if you're worried that is not going to be that good don't worry because this is the best phone for the price and i guarantee you're going to love it and the size the size is not that big you get used to it within like a day or two so don't believe the negative stuff that people say about this phone because its not true. love it with the custom rom. the best phone out there, imo. i work in mobile app development and have access to a lot of phones, but this is the best by far with respect to price vs. performance. we have 4 of them in our family .   i love the phone, the screen size and the functionality. however, the wifi keeps on dropping, even tried firmware update and still not improving .   upgraded from nexus 5, loving the big screen and the speakers ,and the turbo charger. though its pretty big i love the big screen. the main reason of i buy nexus is the purã© andeoid that travã©s ios in the dust and is more user friendly than ios. i just bought this because of the great $299 for 64gb deal. it arrived really quickly. i was updating the phone while charging it and for some unknown reason the phone turned off and wouldn't turn back on. i have tried multiple times to power it back up but it was not turning on at all. you can feel the vibration that the phone was trying to turn on but the screen stayed black and nothing was working. i tried this for over an hour and nothing seemed to work. googling the issue did not turn up any results and it seemed like nobody else had experience this same problem before. after i had submitted my return request with amazon, i tried one more time to turn it back on while simultaneously shaking the phone a couple times, lo and behold the phone magically turned on. i used this opportunity to factory reset it and delete all the information i had just imported. i was hoping to order another one once this return was shipped but disappointed to see that is now all sold out. i now have a bunch of nexus 6 accessories that i cannot use and will have to return as well .   does what i want plus pure android. fast and good value for the price paid .   plus it has wireless charging, double bonus .   it is stated as a new phone. but the seal is broken on arrival. the pre applied protector is dirty. it looks like an used one .   perfect. awesome mobile nothing is wrong with it, only wished for a removable battery, but for 250$ i can't complain. wonderful phone and still relevant in 2015. great phone after rooting and optimizing it to suit my needs. out of the box, the phone has terrible battery life, usually lasting half the day with moderate usuage. background apps and the high resolution screen killed this thing quickly. i looked online and found an app called doze to help kill the background apps when the screen is off. also, i lowered the resolution to 1280x720 to further lower the demand on the battery while using the phone. both fixes let me use the phone all day and into the night, averaging about 18 hours with moderate usage. beyond the battery life, i love the phone and its speediness. good job google and motorola .   it was ok i ended up having to root it and put another os on it wi-fi hotspot with broke they wanted me to call at&t and i'm on cricket cricket said they didn't care so i rooted it and all is good this is a great phone does everything it even has wireless charging and rapid charging. i ordered 64 gb nexus 6 but the phone i received is 32 gb. the 32gb version was available for 249$ when i ordered this one for 299$. this is simply pathetic; did not expect this to happen. simply ruined by new year surprise .   please look into it asap .   i have previously owned a moto x and iphone. i purchased this phone when amazon ran a black friday sale. i love the stock android and the nearly instant os updates from google. i also enjoy not having the bloatware and tacky logos that carriers, especially verizon wireless, load on their phones. if this phone had a 5 inch screen and the native motorola camera app, i would probably rate the phone a solid 5. however, the 6 inch size is just too large, making the phone much less portable and user-friendly. it doesn't fit well in a pant pocket. in fact, i can't even sit down with the phone in my front jean pocket. i do hope google chooses to use motorola again for a future nexus device as i really like motorola devices (other than the verizon-corrupted droid line), but please, make it a 5 inch device. bigger is not always better .   ----------------------------------------------------- quick first impression: 12/31/15 i got the phone today, and was really excited to open it, but as soon as i got the box opened, i was immediately disappointed with what i saw. even though it came wrapped in the original packaging, i am not sure if i got a new phone as there were some marks on the back of the phone. i tried to clean them off, but they wouldn't come off, as they appeared to be either from the manufacturing (poor quality control) or that i got a used unit, sold as new. as for screen resolution, i put a fire phone next to the nexus 6, and the images and videos look much better on the fire phone. the nexus 6 has a more tinted look to the screen and the white is not as white. sound is pretty good, but not as good as the iphone 6. i am glad i didn't pay too much for this phone ($299 plus tax), as i feel that this isn't a premium phone, and it isn't as good as other android phones. i am sure i won't be buying motorola products in the future as motorola mobility's been sold to lenovo. motorola used to have quality products, but that's no longer the case. ---------------------------------- 1st update: 1/1/2016 just noticed today that when playing music/video the sound gets distorted when volume is set high, but not at maximum. at first i thought it was because of vibration from the case, but problem persisted after removal of phone case. this phone is getting bumped down 1/2 star as a result of this. now it's 2 1/2 stars. this reaffirms what i posted before .  this is not a premium phone. i guess i got what i paid for .   too big for my hands. excellent. do not buy this phone .  overheats alot and worst battry backup .  restarts many times in a day .  not even worth 1star. i bought this phone when the price is $250. it is really good phone and strongly recommend it to people who like big phones and values .   love the product .   i love my nexus 6, i unfortunately ordered my phone just before the price dropped to $249.99. this phone is probably the best value for android phones currently on the market. it officially has marshmallow 6.0.1. i love the wireless charging feature .   excellent large smartphone. comfortable and beautiful design. good autonomy with a very high-quality display. stereo speakers give good sound. good hdr + camera that makes high-quality images even in a dark room. good communication and keeps the battery for long enough .   my wife is an iphone 4/5/6 plus user until she dropped her 6 plus in the water. while she was hesitant to dish out another $900 for another iphone, i let her used my nexus 6 temporarily. i now has claimed it permanently. she does miss the fingerprint sensor on the iphone but she likes the turbo charging and wireless charging capability and the large screen .   very nice. by far the fastest phone i ever owned .  the phones looks and feels like good quality .  the phone runs super fast and doesn't hesitate or skip a beat .  which is the main reason i desperately wanted this phone because its pure android with the best hardware which makes for super fast accurate phone .  i got this phone for 249.00 on amazon, and initially i refused to pay 650.00, but when i saw the price 249.00 i didn't even think twice i brought it quickly because the phone is worth more .   i was on the fence buying a phone this big .   but i am glad i did. this is a great phone and having pure android is an amazing software experience .   awesome phone! still prefer it over the nexus 6p and 6x .   all of the great things about this phone have already been stated. my only gripe is being so large people have a hard time hearing when using the phone as a phone. i have to make a conscious effort to position the mic close to my mouth .   i have really enjoyed this phone. prior to this i had a nexus 4 and a nexus 5. loved the 4, but had constant issues with the 5. still decided to go for another nexus after accidentally dropping my nexus 5 in water. so glad i did! this had been my favorite nexus phone so far. zero issues and i love the large screen size .   model:xt1103.too big~my iphone6s like a boy~ 2k super amoled so amazy. i will buy it again~. this is first time i am using motorola, i see this product is not quite good as we have samsung lg .  its cache gets fill quickly .  its waste of money .  wtsup .  fit application gets crash all the time. fit is not even opening .  same issue with some nexus in built apps.i raised submitted reviews with google too .  i wont suggest this phone .   the phone is good, but the dramatic drop of price makes me feel like i am fooled (less than 2 months ago, i bought it for $350; now it is $250). i just bought this phone less than a month ago as the us version (white with 64gb of storage). i also own the new huawei 64gb nexus 6p. i use both phones with project fi through google. i always wanted to get the nexus 6, but there was always some issues; pricing being one of them. well, with these prices it's fair to say this is a non issue anymore. the second issue was one that i encountered in two different areas, both with the same phone. got the phone and installed a verizon nano sim card at a corporate store; upon installation it immediately updated to android 5.1. however, when it attempted to update to android 5.1.1 a system error occurred stating that it could not fins an application named: (com.android.nfc). also, as soon as i began charging the phone the back panel started detaching. i returned the phone immediately for a full credit. i knew there was some build issues with this phone when it first launched, but i always thought that those were ironed out by motorola and google; apparently not. recently, i read that motorola made a commitment to replace those phones that had a built issue; being aware that both the system issue and built issues were isolated ones i decided to give the nexus 6 another chance. this one has been just perfect so far. great battery life. i love the size and form factor; small phones make my big hands and fingers feel handicapped. so sar i like the phone, but there are a few things that need to be sorted out. and since it is my first nexos and marshmallow just came out, i am still not sure if my issues are hardware or software-related. phone is fast and i like the many features it has. i got it hooked up with sprint with no issues other than sprint taking almost a month to send me the proper sim card .   6" inch  .   i don't use my computer anymore  .   and i got it on black friday 200 dollars deals. the hand set had issues with the power switch, usually one need to press the button 4 - 5 times with the hope that it would switch on. its really sad amazon selling such item. hence had to return the set, it costed me with the cost of paying for the screen cover. i would like amazon to see into the matter and return the amount deducted for the screen cover. overall would not recommend as well as amazon need to make sure they sell good product. i have been a long time iphone user and have always loved to play with new android phones on the market. i've had note 4,5, galaxy s4,s5,s6 edge and s6 edge+. none of them have impressed me as much as this phone. this phone deserves 5 stars. i won't make this review long. here are the things i love about it: - larger display in same size phone when compared to iphone 6 plus. - really well finish. high quality all around. i have the white one and the white back with chrome nexus logo looks classy. - really fast and snappy. thanks to quad core processor and 3 gb of ram. - pure android experience. fast updates. 6.0.1, say what! - high resolution screen - wireless charging - price, price, price. i got it for $200 on black friday. no phone comes close to this specs at this price. this is what you pay for the cheapest iphone on a 2 year contract! i decided to give it 4.5 stars because of couple of issues. since amazon does not allow half stars, 5 stars it is. the two issues with the phone are: - camera is bad. i mean it's bad! - i wish the back was flat instead of curved. makes it easier to set it on a flat surface .   at 400 this phone is the best bargain you can get with these specs for hardware .   i was a little afraid of it being last generation phone. but it was unfounded. it is plenty of fast, and have a good camera. and the screen feels so nice under the fingers, (and eyes of course). it updated to marshmallow and while i wanted to root it at first. it already have everything i need, so i am not even doing it. i had to root and flash htc, that i had before. i absolutely love it .   absolutely love my new phone. i thought it might be too big, but now i am used too it and can't understand how i used those smaller phones. it is really fast, has a beautiful screen and has a ton of support. i bought it to use on google fi cell service and it performs perfectly. i find myself not going to my 8" tab s hardly at all anymore since this is big to suit my needs. this means i do not have to have two devices laying around. i love that it is qi compatible and works perfectly on my wireless charger. the turbo charger it comes with is fantastic and charges my device in minutes, not hours. very handy when you are in a hurry. i have yet to test it overseas, but hopefully soon as it seems to have a ton of support for wireless bands. the front facing speakers are definitely a plus as well. i don't have to turn it up so loud to hear my audio. being this is a google phone, you get the system updates much quicker. i am already on marshmallow and enjoying every minute of it .   the phone is very good.it have a good price.the screen is more orange but i can accept it.the phone have a smooth and stable system .   the nexus6 phone exceeds my expectations, i purchased the 32gb version of this phone for $250 on amazon.com for my wife for christmas. i (nate) have used a samsung s5 for the past 2 years now and really like the s5, but to be honest i am a bit envious of my wife's nexus6. the screen seems significantly larger than the s5 screen and the nexus6 came with no pre-installed crapware. my understanding of the nexus6 is that it is sponsored by google and receives all of the firmware updates as soon as they are released; meaning this phone wanted to install quite a few (6?) firmware updates after turning it on and connecting it to wifi. the camera on this phone works great for still images, though i find that the video mode has issues with maintaining a reasonable focus, and continues to try to pull focus by over-correcting then under-correcting like a 1 semester videography student. i bought this item as a gift for my dad who travels internationally. he mentioned that it looks as if someone had carefully opened the package but the phone looks good. he didnt think much about it until he got to his destination to find out that there was no charger in the box. can't send it back before the return date since will be gone for the next 6 months. please check all contents .   counter-intuitive user interface, full of glitches, very touchy. it looks nice but it fails at the most basic level--can't receive incoming calls. spent a lot of time reading forums trying to resolve the issue but to no avail. you're better off finding something that actually works. a waste at any price point. update: i reset the phone to factory settings. calls come in--some of the time. the phone runs hot, and battery life is poor, even after tweaking the phone's settings to optimize battery life. i stand by my earlier review that this phone is junk. update: after working for a few days the phone will not receive incoming calls again. i have read on forums that this might be due to a glitch caused by the sim card switching between sprint and t-mobile. i will be returning the phone since it's defective. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this phone .   i'm have spotted an issue with my screen on the 4th days of use and i see this blue blotch on the bottom right corner and it seems to look really ugly. i have a screen protector and it's not the problem. is there any way i can get a replacement? how do i add an image to this review .   frankly this is my first smartphone so i'm not qualified to give a comparative review. i can say i like the heck out of it and have had no functional issues. i'm like a kid with a fantastic new toy. it's faster than i expected for a mobile computing device, and i'm approaching 100 apps without putting a significant dent in the storage space. a device such as this is somewhat like a 'gateway drug'. the phone itself is just the beginning of what you end up buying: a case, armored glass, various holders, premium apps, external gadgets and toys which work with android, so forth. i guess that's the whole idea, isn't it? so yeah, i'm now a thoroughly hooked fish, but not complaining because it's fun so far .   looks that phone was used condition. there are fingerprints on body and screen .   transaction was great. got the product fast. works on both cdma sprint and gsm t-mobile. wish it had more apps installed but i guess it better than 20 apps you don't need. i would like to see some more widgets too. i guess i am just spoiled from my htc. that had a voicemail app and a post to fb without using the fb app (which drags) .   let's hope it don't break on the first drop like my friends nexus 5 .   device will not update to marshmallow. i specifically purchased a nexus for the quick updates. like the phone but i may return it and spring for the nexus 6p .   this is a really, really big phone. it's not for pockets, pal. but the specs are excellent. if you can handle the size (it does matter), then this is a great deal when it's on sale .   its way to big to hold in your hand. i had a screen problem in less than a month after buying, it had a black line as screen defect. the music quality is good and happy to get 32gb memory. 6 inches screen is not a piece of cake .   the screen cover is starting to peel off after being in place for a day, not very promising. the case itself is lightweight and seems sturdy enough .   very pleased .   as somebody who likes to get a new phone every 6 months or so i have a lot of experience with a lot of different phones. this has been my favorite phone top date! it will take a lot of getting used to if i go back to a smaller phone than this one. i have found that this definitely takes two hands to use comfortably, which is fine by me because i was expecting that coming into the purchase. the nexus experience is great! fast updates and no carrier installed bloatware to deal with and worry about it slowing down the phone. i do find with certain apps i will get some lag on the phone, but i'm certain that is an app issue and not a phone issue. definitely would recommend .   i think i would be it over again. does feel big as soon as u start using it. excellent. good. a perfect huge phone if you want to protect your eyesight .   battery drains very quickly .   suddenly, the network coverage is missed, what i should to do .   great phone! very fast, great picture and overall quality. i was a little worried about the size, but it actually not as bad as i expected .   the best price for specs and size hands down. too bad that typically means google is officially done and moving on because i'm pretty sure at $250 they could have covered the earth in instances wanted by eager folks looking for an excellent phone at an excellent price .   nice phone great price .   if you don't own a nexus, try one. with the exception of the 6p - this might be the best phone available on the.market .   other than camera this is a great nexus device. can't pass for the price i paid .   love this phone. i've been waiting to purchase this phone when it went on sale and definitely would recommend it. the size of the phone might not be for everyone, but i really like it and it still fits well enough in my pockets. also the battery life is not hindered by the screen size, plus it charges extremely fast. the phone itself is a little slick, so i would recommend a case. works great on verizon .   don't let its price fool you; it's the best android phone! no, i mean it's the best cell phone out there .   when it first came it was a double click type of thing and no swipe or touch worked. i was able to set it up with having to double click everything but spent hour+ with tech in philippines and he was good but couldn't fix it. he gave me the 800 number of motorola tech and tech there was able to get it to work the way i had seen on you tube. i am going to get project fi sim card and get off straight talk. my wife has a nexus 6 and had to go through a lot to get it set up but she really likes it and i sure hate to part with my lg g3 but can't get on project fi with it. i had decided to return it to amazon but now i am going to keep it. had label printed and never thought it would work but it is ok now. it is super easy to get your stuff from the other android phone by putting them back to back for just a few seconds. got it from amazon's black friday deal. tried with verizon, at&t and now my son use it on walmart family mobile(tmobile). this might be the best phone in the price range. two things stands out: 1. it comes clean without any bloat wares. i have to download some google apps considering this is a nexus. 2. thanks to #1, the battery life is superb. with a full charge, my son uses it on web browsing, game playing, camera remote controlling for almost a day .   love the phone just not the battery life. great screen, nice camera, great reception and pure android. it's definitely a winner .   great phone arrived quickly. nice .   phone for the size and price .   the phone arrived on time. it is a decent phone for the price .   the first copy - dark stripes on a white background screen. amazon sent a replacement. second - peeled lid swollen battery. goodbye motorola .   this is a great phone. the stock android os allows for a clean and efficient operation. moving from a 5 inch phone to a 6 inch phone will take some getting used to in terms of altering holding patterns. the screen is slightly curved therefore be careful when ordering tampered glass screen protectors. there are no notification lights on the phone as well which can be inconvenient. the battery life usually lasts an entire day and the quick charging feature is extremely convenient if you drain the battery. the front facing speakers provide clear sound. note: a quick charger is included with the phone, however headphones is not included. overall a great phone with a good balance of simplicity and features .   motorola did an amazing job when designed this phone and now day is a year old is cheaper, its probably the best price-performance ratio you can get. all on this phone is top notch and can easily compete with any other flagship. ps. the camera can take really good photos with good light but on low light is very overwhelming .   phone seems very good, hardware is good/very good, build quality is very nice, screen is excellent. the camera is adequate but not spectacular. at the current prices (dec 2015) is a real bargain. however, a huge issue if you are using at&t that people need to be aware of - if you put an at&t sim card in the phone, it becomes "locked" to at&t and the updates do not come from google as with other nexus phones - the updates are dictated by at&t. somewhat defeats the point buying an "unlocked" phone. as of now (late december 2015) at&t users still have not received the android m update over the air. there are work arounds for this if you are techy, but they shouldn't be needed when you buy an "unlocked" phone. while you at least don't have the at&t bloatware, this lack of updates direct from google is really a deal killer for me. i would rate this 4.5 stars for non-at&t users, with the mediocre camera being the main negative point. but if you are on at&t, beware that google has allowed at&t to dictate the updates for your phone. thus the 3 star review .   i really like the size of this phone. for some people, it might be too big, but it is a perfect side for a phabet. i wish google incorporate the finger scanner on this phone like the nexus 6p .   i received 2 phones and package was damage and phone box was damaged also and phone is has scratches in screen. just what i wanted to replace my sluggish lg phone. i used to own nexus-line phones and became so accustomed to custom roms, developing my own rom for the past several years. then i got a cheap lg volt to try the ringplus serivce and just couldn't use it as it felt like a toy phone compare to a nexus 5 i was before. i couldn't use nexus 5 for ringplus as it's an international version so i bought this american version nexus 6 and couldn't be happier. also the big screen really helps as my vision is getting worse due to aging. quick-charging is awesome as well. now off to building my own rom for nexus 6 .   good product #love nexus. the phone is working well. using the phone on project fi network .   update - its been a few days now since i've used the phone. its doing well. signals on tmobile are great, wifi calling is working and i'm on marshmallow 6.0.1. i initially had a scare about the batterylife but after the first full charge i'm getting awesome battery life compared to my previous zenfone 2. now i have a case to protect this beautiful phone. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” arrived before christmas = +100 i have not turned on the phone yet since my nano sim card has not arrived. that said i can't wait to use this phone and leave my experience here. one thing i'm worried about is the back cover. i understand the n6 has an issue with the rear cover coming off due to bad adhesive or a expanding battery. the placement of the rear cover around the metal border/sides of the phone doesn't look quite even. the crease on the right side looks wider than the crease on the left. i don't care much for the aesthetics but i hope my phone does not have issues with the rear cover coming off in the future. also hope this is not a sign of a used or refurbished product. i already have a tempered glass protector installed and do not plan to use the phone til my case arrives in two days either .   this came in as expected. absolutely love this phone i was going to get the new nexus 6p but i decided against it because this was only $350. let me just say it probably isn't any faster than the nexus 6p but it probably isn't much slower due to only a year difference and that the newer processors aren't as focused on speed as they are on processing power and more cores. so in the end i'd get this over that especially due to screen size being 5.96 in vs the 5.7in screen. great phone! great camera, very fast even with 3gb ram since it doesn't have all of those bs bloatware from other phones .   small scratches on the earpiece .   my first experience with a google phone was with the nexus 4. fantastic phone. minimal bloatware. very fast, snappy processor. great, great phone. i made the mistake of purchasing an mt8 after the nexus 4 and regretted it from the start. now that i've learned from my mistake i've upgraded to the nexus 6 and am once again enjoying all the perks i loved with the 4, plus a few added bonuses. experienced some battery drain issues when initially upgrading to android marshmallow 6.0 but that was quickly corrected with the release of marshmallow 6.0.1. huge screen, good front-facing speakers (finally! why don't all phones do this now .  ), exceptional processing speed and very sharp resolution. highly recommended .   amazing phone .   bought this phone when it was $249.00 what a buy. previously had a oneplus one which died, physical size was about the same but has a better and bigger display but feels lighter. wish it had the double tap to wake and some notification lights however. charges pretty fast. my "phone" needs to do a lot of things for me, i still don't know why they call them phones, they do have that capability but i use more for other uses .   great phone. works with cricket .   wow, better than you think. very good quality. fast delivery, good stuff, thank you very affordable price .   as soon as i got my phone i couldn't open the sim tray. there was no resistance when placing the tool in. i tried other tools like a needle and paperclip but still nothing. love it .   i received my nexus 6 today i immediately checked and did receive the correct model xt1103. very happy with purchase quick shipment correct model as promised. big beautiful screen ,popped the sim card in and connected to lte network for at&t worked perfectly. at this price you can't go wrong. it updated about 4 times and i now have the marshmallow operating system. using nine email application i setup my server email again no problems.great phone .   got mine delivered today and im surprised to see price went up again. bought it for 250 such a steal and a great phone overall .   love this phone! best phone i ever had beautiful screen, all day battery life, front facing speakers, and of course stock android! a steal at this price what are you waiting for .   great phone, 3 cons i found - horrible camara, feels like we are back in 2006 by photos quality and its big thick and heavy. other than that its a very good phone, its very fast, andriod 6.0 is great, battery life is very good, setero speakers are amazing. only thing i could ask is for headset, there is no heatset in the box. other than that its maybe the best phone 300 usd can get you. battery consumption is too fast, the other is very beautiful. very good. awesome phone .   this replacing my nexus 5 which got the boot loop of death. can' t wait for it to come in .   plus we t was $250 plus no interest for 12 months. score .   now now both my phones are nexus 6s. work and family lines .   great phone. haha. i got a chance. i bought this item with good price. thank you .   i purchased this phone with great hope, but once i updated it started to crash. i'll never buy motorola cell phone w/ android os .   great phone for a man! originally, i think this phone is not as elegant as iphone or samsung's note. but after i put in a black case which matching with black frame very well, the phone looks pretty masculine, i like it! not as feminine as iphone! also i really like the simplicity of pure android os, without a lots of bloated applications. simple, and masculine phone, i like it! ice on the cake, i got the phone $250 as black friday deal .   i got this phone for 199 on thanksgiving from amazon. i received a phone which is good in all functions but had a very inherent problem where the screen was splitting into two halves. i called amazon about a week later and told them about my problem and no questions asked, they sent me a new phone in the next 36 hours. i'm writing this review from this phone and its totally amazing. advantages: - large screen makes it easy to the eyes - great processing power (clocks about 69000 as brand new and about 62000 with all apps loaded and upon regular functioning on antutu) - makes people turn their heads or at least notice the phone - i ran whatsapp, a 62mb size game, several internet and twitter pages and it can run everything simultaneously without any effort. - front side speakers. you will notice the advantage once you start using it. downsides: - camera doesn't give the power of a 13 mp. i think google camera sucks and not the phone camera. - size maybe an advantage but sometimes a disadvantage too this was a really great buy for 199$. ******recommend it******** .   love my phone. only wish it had the "tap the screen to turn on screen" feature like my lg g3 did. other then that, its super fast, takes awesome pictures, and no bloatware. plus i got it for $199 .   state of the art! manufactured under google specification with no performance or memory hogging "bloatware" from manufacturer (motorola) nor from your service provider! the display is soo big, you will rarely use a tablet, as you can read web articles with a lot of screen content before scrolling. google specification with manufacturer motorola combined for a "home-run" on the nexus 6 .   very goooood. love the phone with the bigger screen. some might think its too big for a smartphone but it didn't take much time to get use to the feel .   this phone get hot too fast and even i could not talk without speaker. do not recommend but looks good .   i ordered nexus 6 on black friday sale. amazon sent me a faulty piece. it hangs and its screen display automatically splits into many parts. i have to restart my phone to get it back to normal .   as expected, awesome phone. motorola nexus 6 is a beauty and the beast  .   . beautiful screen . very sharp and vivid colors . extremely fast . awesome camera . light weight compare to it's size got this flagship on sale so it's a win win for me. what can i say? this phone is not only the perfect size, but it's also incredibly fast. i'm in love with my phone! wont need to upgrade for a while .   it's a good product by moto and google. however, there's some problem globally. there's a chance that if you set the volume max when the battery is blow about 60%, the speaker will drop after 1--3 seconds. and it can't be solved until now, more than a year since it came to the world. the only way is to have a replacement until you get a workable one. maybe you have to try many times replacement. annoying .   was a great phone until the gorilla glass over the screen shattered. the whole thing is just glued together so it is economically unfeasible to get the glass replaced. the whole screen has to be replaced and at $179- $230 for the repair (motorola and independent respectively) that is more than half of the cost of the phone. it's a shame it's all glued together .   working nearly flawlessly. android updates come quick. battery life has gone down a bit since i started using it, but it still is really good! user interface and customization is wonderful. works great with ting mobile .   i got my phone on thursday, took it to verizon for a sim card and my life has returned to normal. this is a great phone, but i am concerned about the charge. it doesn't keep a charge all day .   screen cracked the first time i dropped it. the edge of the screen is broken with the protector covering it .   great phone, especially if you like em big. two stereo speakers mounted on the front, like they all should be, provides loud and clear sound. 6" screen which makes viewing video a pleasure. fast enough to be compared to phones costing twice as much. the only problem i've had to date, is sometimes the android os goes nuts and quickly drains the battery. it's only happened twice, and it should be a known issue. otherwise i get 2.5 days easy, but i'm not always glued to the phone .   great phone besides the subpar camera and you will probably need to charge it every day. i went to this from an iphone 4 and it's a whole new world. love it .   it's a bit quirky. for some reason they designed the phone so that the power button is next to the volume button. i'm constantly locking the phone while watching videos which pauses them and forces me to log back in .   this phone is excellent. i love the speakers on the front, and the large screen is great. i went from an htc one m7 to this phone, and i was worried about it being too big. it isn't. it fits nicely in the hand, and i can slip it into my jeans without issue. it is fast and capable, and the camera is nice. mine came with a little unevenness in the screen backlighting, but it's only noticeable if you have a totally white image on the screen, otherwise you can't even tell. i also haven't yet received the android 6.0 update for some reason, but i'm really picking nits here, this is a great phone at a great price, and i highly recommend it .   love,love,love. a great device. easy to mod. you'll always have the latest android os first. battery life is decent .   this is good for my friend. got updated to marshmallow directly :)! loved the midnight blue! i must get used to the 6 inch! charging super fast .   i was lucky to get this for $199 through amazon's black friday sale. it is a great phone for the price and i have it connected on google's project fi. in the 2 weeks we've had, the phone has been just great. the only negative would be the size - but, i guess people already know it when buying the phone .   great phone to use with google fi. wifi doesnt work .   so nice and i like it .   i got this phone so that i could switch to project fi instead of verizon and have not been disappointed. while it may be a bit on the larger side the battery is excellent and can usually go an entire day without me having to worry about the battery dying in the middle of the day .   my wife loves her new nexus 6 .   good pure android phone .   great thing ! i love it. i bought this n6 with a lightning deal price $199.99. and after about 15days shipment, finally it arrived in china. most service is not available in domestic due to some we-all-know reason. in spite of this, n6 is still a great phone with amazing performance, fantastic and huge screen is great, although its brightness is a little bit low. the photos taken by n6 are too colorful, not like those taken by samsung note4 .   it was real good, amazon its very good, they realy help me when i call about item. thanks amazon. love this phone! easy to set-up, speedy. super fast updates. great price. it's my first unlocked phone, and this won't be my last. love the nexus 6 .   i managed to get one at the two fifty mark for 64gb which makes it an almost surreal bargain (compared to the close to four hundred it goes for currently). pros big, battery life, performance, mild weather resistance, gets the latest updates from google (up to 6.01 as at 12/17/2015), pure android, good phone reception, good wifi reception (both compared to my previous galaxy s3), plenty of memory. great screen, great sound. cons big, battery is built in (i went through 4 replacements in 3 years for my s3, but they were dirt cheap and i could always carry a spare). camera is somewhat disappointing (not a whole heap better than the s3). no expansion possible for memory. i bought a supcase case (seems good, but not tested in anger yet) and a t-mobile sim (just as well, as the s3 sim is completely different). took about 15 minutes to set up. no need to go to a store - i just called my own number to get through to a t-mobile rep, gave them the sim number and i was up and running. biggest annoyance for first day or two was the multiple updates required to get to android 6. make sure you have wifi to do this - it sucks up a lot of data otherwise. i got updated to 6.01 a few days ago (no noticeable difference in my humble opinion). i'm still getting used to native android, the camera app is rather basic (considering getting an app for that to see if it improves anything). not tried taking any videos (not really my thing on a smartphone), but have no doubt it will be at least adequate. i do like that there is no carrier or manufacturer bloatware - some of the samsung apps were very annoying, and poorly supported. i enjoyed my s3 for the 3 years i had it - it took a lot of abuse (dropped many times without a case, had cracks and holes in the frame and cover, but the glass is still intact), was soaked on a couple of occasions (ruined one battery), but still kept on working except of a dubious connector on the sd card slot. it will be kept as a hopefully not needed spare. i can only hope this phone will give me the same service .   s***. the only minor issues i have with this phone is: 1. i would have preferred that that it came just a tad bit smaller, so it would fit more comfortable in my hand. 2. at various time i accidentally press the power button on the side when holding it in my right hand. 3. it rotates when placing it flat on a table. besides those points i'm pretty pleased with the phone .   got a great deal for cyber friday .   i am an iphone user but wanted to try to test out the andriod platform on a large display phone. the nexus 6 is a great phone .   there is a bit of a learning curve if you have been using an iphone, but it's not too hard to figure out. so far so good .   i really love this phone. i never thought i would own a phone of this size but it is fantastic. the screen resolution is great and the battery life outstanding. can't go wrong with the nexus 6 .   good,. by far, the best phone i've ever owned. have carried both apple and android. the android experience is hands down a winner. but this hardware defines the overall experience. beautiful screen, fast processor and plenty of system memory. while 32gb is sufficient for most users, people who take a lot of photos, video or who like to keep a lot of music on their device should consider the 64gb version. i traveled with the phone to europe and used it with sim cards from different carriers abroad. worked perfectly. this is more a testament of the phone's os, but is still one of the devices strongest selling points. i couldn't be happier with the performance of this device. battery lasts me all day, even if i shoot pictures/video and talk for a few hours. excellent build quality and a good fit in medium sized hands. light enough to carry in a shirt pocket, strong enough to carry in jeans .   64gb midnight blue! it's a well-built nexus with dual speakers, a 6" screen, wireless or quick charging, and a solid camera. the battery life is enough for daily use but nothing spectacular. it doesn't have expandable storage or a removable back to exchange batteries, but that comes with the nexus territory. honestly, if this had the 6p camera sensor it would be the perfect phone .   phone has two front facing speakers which are excellent and phone speed is great, i can play n64 emulators on it with no slow down and psp emulators also with no speed drawbacks at all. phone battery lasts me untill about 5pm before i start to worry about charging it with full days use, phone has fast charging so i plug it in for 20 min and im good again, great phone 5 out of 5. side note i am a bigger person, 6'2" and hand span of 9 1/2 inches, phone fits good in my hand i can reach to whole screen except i have to stretch my thumbs a bit to reach top corner of screen, it seems like it would be hard for someone with smaller hands to use .   best phone ever. picked this up as a black friday 2015 deal. i am currently on verizon prepaid and this was easy to get activated. this phone takes a nano sim card and my previous phone also had a nano sim card so i just had to take it out of my old phone and put into this phone. then i logged into my verizon account online and made the switch. as for the phone it works great so far. it is a little big but still fits into my pocket .   love this phone.big sreen .nice setup.would recommend. first unlocked and google nexus phone. my lg g2 started acting up and intermittently not responding to screen commands, so i needed a new phone. a friend of mine mentioned he had an unlocked google nexus 6. i liked the idea of an unlocked phone and one stripped of phone manufacturer and carrier bloatware. the 6's size worried me a little, but i thought i could live with it. ordered the phone and had it shipped to my sister's place (whom i was going spending the holiday with). the day before i got there, she confirmed she got it. we had our thanksgiving, and i went down to the verizon store in downtown seattle on black friday to transfer everything over. the service rep installed the free micro sim card and initiated the porting process. for a change, everything transferred over via the cloud (wasn't clear if it was the google or verizon on)- contacts, apps were reinstalled. the last time i ported over, i didn't realize the phone was using my data plan to pull down all of the apps- the rep ensured that the updates were being delivered over the store wifi. i had to log back in to the apps, but i was soon able to use waze gps to get back to my sister's place. the only things i needed to upload were: songs, photos, and some of the app back ups (notes, contact photos, and car fuel and maintenance records). a month later, my impression is mostly favorable- good battery life, pretty zippy performance. but it is a little too big for my hands- miss being able to one-hand type a text message. the stock goggle interface is just that- pretty basic. some of the widgets that i was used to were lg based - weather app, ringtone selector, alarm, flashlight. luckily the goggle play store had some good analogs to what i was used to. and if i go ahead with a switch to another carrier like i plan in the near future, it will be a simple matter to swap sim chips! wish i got the 5x instead but still overall a happy camper with this purchase .   overall phone was new but the volume button was damaged, and came with a used charger that belonged to an older generation of phones(1.5amps) could have replaced it with a new one .   the handset i received , neither wifi nor the cellular data working . too bad. surprised at the great quality. it really was practically brand new. this phone is great, i love it .   as being sammy fan with touchwiz i was little skeptical about pure android. but noticed this giant phone is so snappy, no lag at all. i had a doa with first one but then amazon replaced so quickly. got a marshmallow update right away, this thing is huge. i liked blue one better than white but again its a personal preference.no con so far. overall with my first nexus device pretty happy with it. amazing phone. got this on amazon black friday. my last phone was a windows phone and before that 2 samsung android phones. windows cannot make a phone, i wanted out after 2 months .   luckily a 5 year old + a sewer drain helped me out. the samsung's made me not enjoy android because both were so slow! i click on an app and 3 seconds later it opens. (i guess i am impatient, but seriously my 5 year old "standard" laptop opens software engineering programs faster). this phone restored my hopes in google's android. fast, powerful, battery lasted 7 days (i do barely use it but i listen to tune in radio 8+hrs a day and podcasts). spent 5 hours (during the 7 days of battery test) updating it but after that smooth it was rolling. theres even more .   or well less i guess, no stupid benign uninstallable apps .   just google apps .  which can actually be uninstalled. i literally had 5 apps on the phone desktop. this phone also works in germany (it's the usa version). i highly recommend getting a woodback for this phone if you get it. i got the padauk; sooo beautiful .  classy and modern. oh and the camera .   i could keep going on, just get the phone :). great. it's xt1103 .   arrived a day late, but hey it is a very busy time of the year. love this phone! sellers said it was like new, and they told the absolute truth. this thing is beautiful. top of the line phone. easy to set up and very fast internet, messaging and phone. had to delete a couple of apns, but that was all i did other than install the sim card and set up my account. working very well with consumer cellular. sim card loads easily without having to remove the rear cover or the battery. could not be simpler. takes great photos and has lots of storage space .   i've had this phone for over a month, and its on track to replace my old samsung note 3 as my favorite phone of all time. pros: + super fast and snappy. no lag. + great signal all over the place + unlockable, root-able, quick android updates from google (great for devs and android hackers) + front-facing speakers will change the way to buy phones from here on out cons: - no sd card slow. c'mon motorola/google! - it's huge; it's like holding a tv screen - microusb port is very temperamental and tough to get plugged into. amazing phone, arrived on time .   no issues so far. smudges/scratches on back right out of the box. replacement ordered. will update .   it is a beast .   great phone, but it gets pretty hot while charging. i've owned countless android devices and this one is definitely my favorite. this is my 2nd nexus device and i will never go back to buying a phone from a cell phone carrier. you can't beat getting android updates first. my only complaint is that when you add a case, the phone is massive .   it is a very responsive phone. battery life is also great. the down side is that it can get hot while using it for youtubing or playing games .   great phone with very few flaws pros: 1) pure android experience 2) 5.9 inch screen: simpy great screen, wide viewing angles 3) snappy processor while switching between apps 4) great battery life if you disable motorola ambient display 5) cons: 1) screen little dim under sun 2) experienced low sound from ear piece (sound) but speakerphone is loud. may be my phone or everyone experience i'm not sure 3) screen size may be little big for few people.for me it is perfect. 4) phone gets hot while charging with turbo charger (the charger it comes with) heard it is expected. i use normal charger .   the phone's box has no earbuds in it .   and i have used this phone for two months till now and the buttery is so bad and i can't end the day with one charge even if i don't use it still running sooo fast , first time i thought i have the option to charge it without fast charge like samsung because i know this kind of charge eats the battery life but unfortunately i was wrong , still not sure if the problem from the battery's quality or the fast charge itself, because i don't feel that fast charge is a feature to me . especially after only two months of using it  .   out of the box, this cell phone worked fine but it had a few glitches. it is bulky, and with a case it becomes huge. the activation of the camera, the time to get focus, color balance and switch to video recorder are slow. the regular phone calls drop relatively frequently (i cannot blame the service provider, because my previous iphone 5 worked fine with the same calls). but what was bothering me the most was that the phone was draining the batter really fast. i have installed android 6 marshmallows, and i have seen a major improvement in the duration of the battery. thumbs up to google for that. except from the camera, this device is fast, snappy and responsive .   love it! however lack of an sd adaptor. the phone was great and everything, very powerful and sturdy, however it came with a camera issue that did not allow any application to connect to the camera. i tried factory resetting the phone many times, cleaning the cache of the camera app and even booting on safe mode and nothing helped. i ended up contacting motorola to get it either replaced or fixed. i sent back more than a week ago and still no email or anything for motorola about it. this has been a really frustating experience and that issue seemed to be in a lot of devices. if you do some research online about the issue you will find many like me .   the specs of the phone are great. apps run smooth and multitasking is a charm but the battery is poor and the reception is poor. it's a cellphone not a tablet. on my opinion these are key features of a cellphone .   love this phone .   the $350 amazon deal came in handy when my screen messed up on my lgg2 still in contract .   pros: turbo charging, 4k video recording, qhd resolution display, super fast updates directly from google, smoooooooooth cons: slightly on the heavy side, camera could be faster, selfie cam is low resolution at only 2mp i'd buy another in a heartbeat. so nice i love it, the best choice do far .   im having problems activating this phone with sprint. does anyone have any suggestions .   love my phone .   nexus 6 .   excellent phone. very fast and looks well made. picture quality is also very good .   best purchase i could have made for my better half .   for the price, this is the best phone i could find. i little bigger than i would have liked, however .   so far - i love it. it's big, but that's what i wanted. i found a great case via amazon, fits well and so far - i am happy. so glad i got in on the bf sale. verizon - in-person help  .    .   useless .   had to use online / chat assistance. not only did verizon online send me a nano-sim card for free - activation was a breeze ! now - if only i could find a compatible bluetooth for the nex 6 .   any suggestions  .   loveeee this phone. it was ready to go for my first day use when i received it. as it didn't have all the unnecessary apps that makes your phone sluggish and tons of space for my music and photos. only thing was it look like ipad mini when next to my face because its so big. beside that, i would definitely buy it again .   good value. excellent condition. have only had the phone about a week but its nice upgrade for me from the galaxy s3. have unlimited data and hot spot works nicely. was afraid due to being an unlocked phone i might have a problem but verizon hooked up no problem. great decision to purchase .   i bought a new one but it's back has a scratch .   love the large screen. well built .   there are a lot of scratches on the phone .   great phone! i popped in a cricket sim and everything just worked. coming from a samsung s4 the phone feels a lot faster. camera quality is as good or better depending on light .   perfect for international location. i gifted this to my brother in india and it is working without any glitch and pretty seamless with the network. nice display and features. one of the best unlocked phone. data transfer was easy too .   i love it, just getting used to the "raw" android. i do miss some of the features i was using with the nova launcher, but i can always slap that on if i really need to. one nice feature is that i setup my car as a trusted place so when the bluetooth is connected the screen pin is disabled. no more having to fumble to unlock my phone while driving (i know!). got the black friday deal, so $450 off original retail for a 13 month old device, you bet i am happy .   great smartphone, high quality. the only problem is that the screen is yellow tint, and not so bright .   good. i never liked big phones but this one changed that. cannot use with a single hand, but for that i like most of the features. the phone might be a little heavy or huge for some. at first. but, i was using this phone to replace my htc one m9. so, was using this without sim. i should say this phone grew on me. according to the reviews, the ergonomics of the phone is really good. i am not denying that a smaller size would be more comfortable. but, bear in mind a smaller size phone with bad ergonomics have prevailed in the market. i was a fan of the smaller phones myself and even made fun of my friend who had a samsung galaxy note. :) having said all that, what made me hang on to this phone: - stunning display. the colors are absolutely brilliant. especially the black looks like black. not grey! gaming and videos are an immersive experience! - the display is awesome, yes. but, the marshmallow os is so fluid. no lags! i thought i would like htc one m9. i moved from a nexus 5 (broke it, my bad!) to htc. but, htc's sense has several issues. the dialer and contacts app was a big headache for me. never liked it. htc doesn't make use of the marshmallow ui's fluidity. but, when i switched back to pure android on nexus, i feel how much pure android has improved. love the new dialer app in nexus. i would say android or rather google has concentrated on the most important elements of the phone now. dialer, settings, lock screens. everything looks beautiful. and, app permissions! - the phone itself is beautiful. looks like a sturdy phone. metal sides. nice curved glass. but, i guess i need a case, just because i should be cautious. the dimpled logo on the back is a good design to rest your phone in your hand. - battery life. i guess the battery life is good enough. if you are an average phone user, the phone can even last a day. i guess marshmallow does have battery optimizations by hibernating apps. well, whatever! this one has a good battery life. especially for such a large display. if i have used lot of games, obviously i would go down. standby doesn't drain battery a lot as it used to in previous versions of marshmallow. a big plus. - wifi calling. i am using t-mobile. so, thank goodness, this phone has hooks for t-mobile wifi calling. yes! you read it right. i got this phone from amazon, not t-mobile. and, wi-fi calling works perfectly, just turn it on in the settings in your phone app. well, unlocked phone and a nexus means no bloatware crap! of course nexus means some useful features not available. but, this is android! you can always fill the gap with apps. and, only with the apps you need! motorola and google have done a good job! they are not the same company anymore right, ? ;). wow. amazing phone from google. very happy so far. it is little bit big and i understand now why everyone settle on 5.7 inch:-) set up was smooth. it took 2 hour to apply all the os updates. phone is very fast, fluid and screen is really nice. thanks google and motorola for making such nice phone. only problem i have is on grip of the phone. it is very slippery. i found a nice case for it .   made by poetic. it fit perfectly and makes it even nicer .   the box protect very poor,has bee hit or fall pong. fantastic! it is factory unlocked and sold new. it works beautifully with my carrier (consumer cellular). outstanding phone, world-class camera, great storage capacity at 32 gb, super fast processor, very stable platform. can't wait to get android 6.0 (marshmallow) any day. let's go, google .   i am using it to write this review. it is us version updated to marshmallow 6.0 by itself. i love it. recommended .   the phone is generally great. having an unlocked phone and everything that comes with that is really nice, and it was easy to get it activated online without having to call (verizon.) i was worried about that b/c i'd seen a lot of people complaining about what a pain it was to get them to activate it on their network. obviously it's pretty big, but i like the size- i don't have huge hands, and i can pretty comfortable use most things one-handed, e.g. sending a text. sure it's easier two handed, but given that it's freezing, i like to keep one hand gloved :) i had an htc one m8 before this, which is a bit smaller, but the size was awkward- i had to use two hands, even though it was smaller. the setup was easy, transferring all my contacts/photos etc. was easy. i did it through importing from the cloud instead of the tap thing b/c my old phone wouldn't work for some reason, but it really wasn't a pain. photos are great quality. some people might not like that the back is plastic instead of metal, but i am really happy about that b/c it makes it way less slippery. the biggest problem i had with my htc was how easy it was for it to slip out of your hand, hence cracked screen if you like to live on the edge and don't have a case or if your overpriced plastic dot case broke and was annoying to have on anyway. the cons (which aren't that bad, just want to be specific about the things that bug me): 1. the google keyboard is designed so you have to switch to punctuation keyboard every time you want to use a question mark, exclamation point, etc. i've been trying to figure out how to change that, and i suppose i could download an app to fix the problem, but i haven't gotten that far yet. 2. the camera seems to be kind of slow in processing pictures. this might be a setting i can change, i'm not a big picture taker so i haven't tried yet. 3. you can't change the app overview appearance to tiles instead of tabs, so if you have a number of apps running/chrome tabs open, it's a lot harder to dig through them to switch back and forth. you can make chrome tabs separate from app tabs, but that doesn't really solve the problem for me- i generally have a few apps going at once. i also notice that i accidentally leave a lot of apps running at once when i thought they were closed b/c you can't see very many at once, if that makes sense. there was one more negative that i had in mind, but now i can't remember it, so i guess that must mean it's not that big of a deal :) all in all i really like the phone- i have been busy since i got it so i haven't sat down and set everything up exactly how i want it/tried to change much besides switching all my old junk over, but w/the experience i do have, it's a great phone .   i got this phone on a sale from amazon. i have been a galaxy note user for long (note 2 and note3). i wanted to try nexus phones as i heard much about them in the past and i did. my feedback is mixed but mostly on the negative side. here is the summary of it: * design - the phone seems to be on good quality. does not feel cheap on hand. having that said, the grip of the phone is terrible and was not comfortable at all due to the curved back + big size * performance - this phone is a little faster than the note 3 i had before, specially on web browsing. however, watching movies and youtube was better on my galaxy note 3. for example, the galaxy note 3 had seamless rotation of the screen while watching a movie. nexus had a pause. * upgrade - this was the main reason that brought me to the nexus (being able to receive android updates on time). i believe many people have this perception as well. well, this is not accurate and there is a fine print here. for example, once i added my at&t sim in it, it updated the firmware to that. i was surprised to learn that at&t has to approve the android 6.0 update so that my phone can get it ! this was a huge disappointment. some people have a workaround to flash the rom yourself. but come on, why do i have a nexus if i will end up doing all the dirty work user experience - this was the biggest disappointment in the phone. i have not recognized how much samsung has invested in improving the note experience until i tried the nexus. the nexus 6 is simply a big phone with very basic ui (some may like this because it makes the phone a little fast as i mentioned earlier). however, there no software and interface to take advantage of the big screen. samsung note series has the multi-window display, full integration between calls/messages/ .  , s-pen and soooo many other enhancements that makes the note series a very unique android phone on its own. the bottom line is, do not only compare the hardware specs (which may be the same between many phones today). think about the usability/performance/support. personally, because of the surprise that at&t controls my android upgrades + the very basic usability, i sold my new nexus 6 and bought a more expensive used galaxy note 4. as a side note, i see many reviews from others who upgraded from galaxy note 3 to nexus. they gave nexus 6 4~5 stars. however, the contents of their reviews speak more about how good the note was .   overall the speaker is also possible that the bar will move .   pros: excellent voice and display quality, and reliable, fast internet using t-mobile. cons: buggy, annoying software. example: if i receive a phone call while the phone is locked, it is impossible to answer the call. even after entering my pin to unlock the phone, it continues to ring but i cannot answer the call - i can click every icon, and swipe in every direction - to no avail. i have to wait until the caller hangs up, then call them back. this is apparently a known problem, and the workaround is to disable the locking feature, so my phone is now less secure. or, i could go through the frustration of trying to follow all the steps in the multi-page troubleshooting instructions, ending with "revert to factory settings," but i don't want to spend my time trying to fix buggy software! maybe i'm expecting too much, but based on my experience with every phone i've used since the 1960's, it should be a no-brainer to answer incoming calls! now i've paid hundreds of dollars for a phone that requires me to be a technical expert and work around buggy software, just to be able to receive calls. it is infuriating .   this really disappointed me. the cell phone i received is not 64gb. the total storage size is 25gb. i'm thinking it should be 32gb .   the phone is fine (although i am not a fan of some of the unnecessary "updates" to the user android interface that are yet again forced down our throats -- but apparently all the operating systems feel they have to do that all the time even tough there is nothing to improve, only a couple of buttons to hide for no reason -- but at least it's not like the stupid microsoft tiles .   anyways, i digress .  ) but: the charging cable is a fire hazard  .  : about 2-3 three days we wanted to pick up the cable for charging -- and burnt the fingers (slightly), the micro-usb end was scorching hot, the plastic had started smoldering and the whole place started smelling accordingly. sure, we left the charger plugged in while carrying the phone around, but who doesn't ? so, be careful, the charging cable is dangerous  .   i bought this about $250. nice price gives nice work. i love pure android, nexus series. and this one works better and faster than 5x. but finger print .   this phone is fantastic. out of the box (as of december 2015) you are able to upgrade to android m. the quad hd display is great. when paired with the 6 inch display it makes for an excellent media experience. you also don't have to deal with any carrier bloatware which is fantastic in my opinion. it is disappointing to not find some of the motorola features you would find on a motorola phone .   like moto assist .   and moto display .   but is all around a great phone and worth the cost .   i've had all nexus phones and this is by far the best of the bunch. great battery life (especially with android 6.0 and updates) for someone coming for nexus 4 and 5. fast charger is included and is indeed quite fast. nothing i can add that the video reviews don't already say. if you find this phone for under $400, buy it .   great phone. i love the camera. i hate how google tries to sync everything though, but on the plus side you can install your own os on it. yay opensource! :). got this on black friday for my wife. i like it better than my samsung galaxy note 4. it doesn't have the lag like my sammy and the interface is a lot cleaner and seems faster too .   i so want to keep this phone. i got this during the black friday special, however it constantly restarts at random occasions, in addition to that when its mounted on my car deck, i have a hard time unlocking it for some odd reason? google badly needs to update. if i return this, i shouldn't be penalized if this phone can't run most applications. in addition .   notice how my widgets don't show up on my screen initially, i have to restart my phone to get my widgets to show. https://goo.gl/oyuidg. simply the best phone i have ever owned! the screen, while large, is bright with great color reproduction. while researching, i heard stories about strange tints in the screen, but i have never experienced it, so i'm assuming it was fixed in one of the many firmware updates this has received. i am now on android 6.0 and the phone is blazing fast. the most amazing thing is i now can go a full two days without charging my phone on regular use. that with a huge screen and wi-fi and bluetooth always on! camera is very good, with quick shutter time (as long as hdr is turned off) and accurate color reproduction. truly remarkable phone and at these prices, it is the best value out there. one other tip is i am on project fi with this phone and the service has been excellent. i would recommend giving it a try to any owner of the nexus 6, 6p or 5x .   upgraded from an s4 only thing i miss is the ir blaster. love this phone got it for 199.99 on black friday couldn't pass it up. its my first nexus and i feel special. only things that bug me just a bit the front facing camera doesn't do well in low. the rear camera handles it better but not better than my s4 but the nexus does take better pictures in normal lighting. overall very happy and its unlocked i got it for t mobile and wifi calling works. my girlfriend got one too for verizon though it was a bit of pain in the ass for them to activate it. if you already have a nano sim just pop it in .   nice and fast phone . i got it for 200 $ in thanksgiving deal. well worth the money spent. pictures from back camera is good. front camera is just 2 mp, so not very good for selfies. a little bulky, but i stlll like it. its kind of phablet, it has big screen ,s o if you read a lot of stuff on phone, you would like it for the money spent. i upgraded to marshmallow(os) and i love it .   i like the software and most things about the device, but just wished the battery life and camera were better. overall a great device especially with the recent price drops and project fi. i just need more battery life without having to enable battery saver, and a camera that can focus .   had the phone for about 2 weeks now and haven't put a sim card in. loving everything about the phone. my only regret is i did not get one more of it while it was on sale. i love the phone's size, 6.0 inch, a perfect comprise for getting good experience on video viewing, browsing, messaging, doodling. should have ordered more than 1 .   got the phone but it had a few tweaks. i contacted them and they replaced it almost instantly (: i'm extremely happy for it. nice design'ï¼œbut not thin enough. would have given it 5 stars, but it didn't right out of the box. it would not update to android 5.1.1. had to fix it myself .   black friday good chance. good price. satisfaction .   what a great value on a super big pure android phone. my wife and i love ours .   i have bought two nexus 6 phones through amazon - the first for myself and the second for my wife. i initially used mine on verizon but then switched to project fi. i bought my wife hers so she could switch to project fi also. excellent phones with a clean android experience - and since i bought them from amazon no carrier bloatware .   had to get verizon to add the imei number to their database. this process took 5 days and 3 levels of tech support. after it was added everything went great, love the phone. hello android 6.0. heavy and big . it is not easy to scrap in hand. i am in the usa. but i put a chinese sim card in it .the phone automatically believe i am a american,so i can not down load some necessary apps of china .   fantastic phone and a really awesome price point($350). walked into verizon and got a new sim card and was up in running in 5 minutes .   amazing bargain for this price. super nice phone .   this was an excellent purchase. this phone is great. i just got android marshmallow so this review is off that. the phone is super slick and smooth. no lag whatsoever. the camera is surprisingly good, and very fast. battery life is good and will get you a day of use easily. the screen is gorgeous! overall a great phone and a great value for the 64gb version. unfortunately the screen gets scrambled quite often, you need to press the main button and press again to see the screen fixed again. apart from that issue, the phone is nice, but for that money i could have something better .   after 6 month of moderate use it stopped working. got a good deal on this phone for $195 on black friday 2015. this is my second smartphone to replace my samsung galaxy s3. big difference in performance and i like the big display which is easier to read and to type on a much bigger keyboard on the screen. took me awhile to upgrade my android os to marshmellow. i haven't had a chance to use most of the features yet, but i have no complaints so far  .   simply amazing. amazing phone. incredibly happy with my purchase! thank you google .   good but doesn't fit on all the way. will leave behind a strip of non stuck glass protector resulting in a big bubble strip. barely noticeable unless that stuff irritates u but for me it wasn't too bad .   amazing phone. had a little trouble at the store getting it activated, but the tech was able to do it no problems. been playing with it all day. couldn't be happier with my purchase. i was a little worried about the size, but it's not as much of an issue as i thought it was going to be .   $199 on black friday,good deal .   great phone with super high end specs .   if you like new android os update on tie from google. this is for you. can not ask more for 199$. love this phone, i was actually going to return the phone because it quit working after listening to my carrier telling me how to set it up. being a 60 yr old women i got on line and looked up what to do  .  easy breezy .   i did a factory reset and google took it from there . i got all my pictures and contacts .   score .   i purchased this phone in the 64gb flavor and i really like it. the picture quality is good. the responsiveness is quick. the feel is substantial and solid. the only negatives i found were that it is a slick phone; in other words, i could have seen myself dropping it very easily and that it doesn't have a "restart" option. you can restart in safe mode but you cannot opt to simply restart. so, you must completely turn the phone off and then power it back on again instead of simply choosing a restart option. the problem of the phone being slick was easily solved with the purchase of a full body rugged hybrid protective case; but the restart issue is here to stay unless i opt to root the phone. some don't like the size of the phone claiming that it's too large .   personally, i find the phone to be a perfect fit in my hands, but i'm 6'5" and 250lbs and have large hands. i chose this phone because it was a large phone as my eyesight isn't what it used to be. with this phone i can see everything clearly; not so with other cellphones that i have owned .   good deal , and very good product , love it  .   good. got it on sale for $199.99 on black friday 2015 .   love the phone .   will never go back to a 5inch screen again 6inchs or nothing .   the phone is super fast and i love the charger it comes with ( turbo ii and turbo i and basic charge mode ) if you look at the charger on the back it tells you the voltage and it goes as high as 9v 2a on turbo ii mode i thought that was cool havent had any other phone that charges at a dynamic rate .   great deal through amazons black fri sale. this phone is a yr old, but it's still on par w/ everything being put out right now .   i bought this phone about two weeks ago, and it worked very well until today it was dropped from my desk which wass no more than one meter from the floor, the whole screen was broken .   great phone. great phone. i found that i wanted a small tablet in my pocket and tried an international version of the galaxy tab s 8.4 with the phone features built in, but i missed having the lte speeds and it was really just a little to big to hold with 1 hand. when i found this phone, it was perfect. same resolution as the tab s, but only 6 inches instead of 8.4. i have been loving it. quick responsiveness and never seems to get bogged down .   simply good works as a tablet and phone ;-). save money by buying this instead of buying phone and tablet .   amazon customer service just admitted that they were knowingly selling defective units by saying the following when i asked for a replacement unit the second time for the same issue - bubbles under the screen. really disappointing. "i'm sorry to hear the replacement motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 32gb, cloud white (u.s. warranty) had the same problem as your first order. this certainly isn't expected. since it's likely another replacement would arrive defective, i won't trouble you with another replacement.". very good products. product arrived a day early and just as described. phone is excellent! thank you for such a good experience .   this device is less than a month old and the back cover is already peeling off. does not feel premium in your hand and boring. insane prices. mad performance. it's screen looks like stadium. everything is perfect .   best phone i've ever owned bar none! high tech specs, huge screen, good battery life, and it's gorgeous! the best part, i got it for $199 on black friday! i would have gotten it at amazons price regardless which is still a steal! motorola made one hell of a phone. if you're undecided, don't think about it just buy it, you won't regret it. peace out .   huge phone but easy to get used to .   can't be more satisfied with this phone .   upgraded from nexus 5. expecting to be awesome. lets see after 3 months of use .   very pathetic .   too big to handle .   earpiece volume very low .   do not buy it .   i got the brand new phone and camara and bluetooth are not working .   best ever, fast - both nexus 6 & amazon .   this is a great phone for watching youtube and movies. the speakers are loud and clear except that i had some issues. with the top speaker. sometimes i have to jiggle it for it to work. also the volume rockers got stuck once but i fixed it. other than that i love this phone. great screen quality, camera, sound and design. the size doesn't become a issue. coming from a less than 4" phone i got used to this in less than a week. fantastic phone, especially with marshmallow update .   with the black friday deal ($199 for 32gb, $259 64gb), this phone can't be beat. even at amazon's normal price it's a great value and avoids those expensive contracts. i stayed with my at&t gophone plan and only pay $40 a month with unlimited text and talk, 1.5gb of data. most of my online time is via wi-fi so that's more than enough. the phone's extremely easy to use and the huge screen is a plus. i was worried about the size until i got it in hand. it's crisp and bright, great for those of us who are getting far sited and have to take our glasses off to see the screen. it's also good for gaming. it is a little bulky in the front pocket which takes some getting used to, but after a while it's not noticeable. skinny jeans people will need to find another way to carry it. everything is really fast and smooth. voice recognition is accurate and a fun feature to play around with. just say "ok google, open camera" and it goes right into camera mode. you can open all your programs by voice as well as search the web. the dual front speakers are excellent. not a lot of bass but loud and clear. as long as you use the supplied wall charger it charges lightning fast. not so much via usb though. if charging on your computer expect a few hours to go from nearly depleted to 100% full. one problem i had initially was getting my windows 10 pc to recognize the phone to transfer files and allow it to charge. to fix this, go to 'device manager', 'portable devices', then right click on nexus 6. click on 'update driver software', 'browse my computer for driver software', 'let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer', 'standard mtp device', 'mtp device', next. it will download the drivers and your phone will be recognized and start charging. maybe this will help anyone who has the same problem. other than that little bump in the road and slow usb charging i love everything about the phone. the nexus 6p is now available with slightly better specs (albeit a smaller screen). personally i don't think the improvements are worth paying hundreds more outright or getting it through a contract. maybe next black friday, but this is the perfect time to get the nexus 6. overall it has enough bells and whistles to keep this picky camper happy. if you're looking for a big, fast, fun phone, go for it. highly recommended .   best android phone i've had. the antenna reception on this is amazing and it is as good or better than my iphone 6. i'm not sure about other android phones, but it is much better than my galaxy s3 (fair reception) and note 3 (terrible reception, worst i've had on a phone). the camera has some issues maintaining focus at times, so that leaves a bit to be desired. otherwise it's fast, has the best reception and is a nexus, what more can be said .   it could have been better but a good camera phone  .   very nice phone. loved the simplicity of the phone. needed to stream or play video through usb cable to mhl/analog converter for chevy entertainment system. road trips with kids. reasearch indicated that rooting the phone might be necessary. not an option for me. returned to amazon and purchased htc m8 .   the phone is awesome , it just that i didn't get a good piece . screen cover was stuck back on with particles beneath it and lot of dust and fingerprints on the top. faint scratches on the corner of the device .   black friday "special" was obviously a return. screen cover was stuck back on with particles beneath it. stickler on box war broken. faint scratches on the corner of the device. no like for like exchanges .   we use utlize batter saver mode. great phone that works on project fi .   this phone is awesome in my opinion best smartphone value for the price. it is a pure android phone, was i turned it on, it immediately updated to android 6.0. the phone is fast and has a brilliant display, and great battery life .   i have got it for less than a week. during normal use of youtube, half of the screen freezes. later, the phone keeps rebooting every 30 seconds. the phone won't complete a start and won't stop rebooting. i guess only the drain of battery can stop it. hopefully, i just got a defective one. i am contacting motorola to get a replacement, and i paid $25 in order to get an "advance" replacement in 4 business days. let's see how will everything go .   was able to get verizon chip installed with no problems at the verizon store. don't love the camera on this device but other than that it is a dream to have an operating system without bloatware installed .   absolutely loved this phone but after a month it stopped working completely. it's never been dropped, its never gotten wet. it's a shame because i'd love to give this phone a 5 star ratingðÿ˜¢. holy balls i got this for 200 dollars. it's freakin awesome! i love black friday sales. love everything about the phone except the volume. whenever i'm listening to music, watching a video, or talking on speaker the volume dramatically decreases automatically where i can barely hear it even though the phone says its on full volume. i don't know if its some kind of hardware mess up but if i pay for something i expect it to work properly .   this phone is amazing. i had recently owned a note 3, which i sold thinking i wanted a smaller size display. after seeing the price drop of the nexus 6, i had no choice but to ignore the urge for a smaller display and to pick up this 5.96" goodness. when i first got the phone, the colors were a little on the yellow-ish side, but that went away over time and now the color display is awesome on android 6.0 marshmallow. the phone is quick and has not lagged for me, and although some reviewers do not like the camera, i have nothing but glowing reviews from some of the pictures i send to friends. i always use the hdr mode, it really helps color balance and night shots. i will definitely be keeping this phone for a while to come, when it's time for a newer phone this will become my backup. i may even use it as a tablet because media consumption on this device is astounding. great phone from motorola .   wow! awesome phone , couldn't' be happier. after years of trying out different brands htc, samsung, sony and dealing with their bloatware i decided to go with a stock android phone. this is a beautiful phone with awesome features .   great product amazon is amazing .  , **** warning sprint could not activate this phone .   the first phone i got from amazon was very glitchey with the software even after updates so they sent me a second model and it was working perfect for about 2 weeks and then the textile feedback from the power rocker got weaker and weaker n now that doesn't work but its still a great phone and if you get a perfect built on you could use it for a very long time. expensive. excelente cell phone, quality vs price. 10 ptos. here is a quick pros and cons of nexus 6 (first hour) : pros: 1. it's a pure stock android experience. in other words, you know what is inside. it's a big pro. 2. fast updates. when i got this phone, i connected it to the wifi, of course without inserting the sim card. after the first couple of immediate lollipop updates, i was able to download and install android 6 marshmallow. all of it without even inserting my sim card in the new phone. this is account of the first 20 minutes after this baby came into the world. 3. the material design of android goes perfectly with the hardware's big flat real estate. my initial experience after i started using this ui is packed with fluid and fast interactions. the resulting feel is phenomenal. 4. fast charging. just a big whopping wow! 5. perfectly sized. though, a bit wide perhaps, however, it holds nicely in the hand. i know i'd be disappointed with anything smaller after using it. the last statement is a bit subjective. cons: 1. body protection. this baby will slip and find some rowdy ground. it's only a matter of time when. even if you are using this as a secondary phone, get a nice bumper protection. a must, imho. 2. gets a little hotter while charging. 3. the back of this phone gets really slippery if you have oily hands.furthermore, it invites a lot of finger marks. get a nice wooden or leather back cover to mitigate this .   nice phone, good battery .   you must know by now that this is a great device. it is zippy and fast but still it is an example of a nexus device lacking few key features. 1) quality control - the screen is yellow. some call it a warm screen but this one is too dull and too yellow. 2) battery drain - i have not installed many apps and have not even put a sim inside. it updated to marshmallow but still there is battery drain, battery drains in a day. 3) heating issue - earlier phones used to heat under heavy activity but this one heats even for casual browsing .   i can't believe i got a very good deal on black friday. this is the best phone i ever had in my life. the pictures are so great, the speed, ram, memory all is perfection .   what is it? as the name suggests it is the 6th phone in googleâ€™s nexus line as well as their first phone sporting a 6 inch screen. well technically it has a 5.95 inch display. whatâ€™s hot beautiful amoled display. not the prettiest one but a really nice one. price front facing speakers nicely built inductive charging supports google fi network qi wireless charging whatâ€™s not motorola tramp stamp while the camera is one of the best ones found in nexus devices it still mediocre at best. no removable battery no expandable memory camera while not terrible it's just mehâ€¦ design for the most part, all of the nexus devices were designed really nicely. with the nexus 6 it is no different. i has a hard plastic back and a metal encased by a metal chassis with a 6â€ amoled display on the front. the front of the device is devoid of any buttons or indicator lights which gives the nexus 6 a clean look. it has front facing speakers that are built into the screen. the left side of the nexus 6 is clean. the right side has the volume rocker as well as a rigged power button. bottom has the microusb port and the top has the sim tray and headphone jack. i wish the volume buttons were located either lower or on the left hand side of the device. i always seem to press them when i pick up the device. plus itâ€™s a lot harder to take screenshots w/ one handâ€¦ performance: i was a bit shocked, but i havenâ€™t ran into any harsh performance issues. there is a slight bug that i was getting when using spotify (at times when opening into the app it wouldnâ€™t play any volume while the song was playing. this may be a spotify bug or a bug with android 6.0 because i donâ€™t remember this while i was on lollipop.). the phone does run hot when playing gpu intensive games. the audio sounds great coming out of the front facing speakers. the arenâ€™t the best i heard but definitely still only second to htc boomsound. the camera is probably the biggest disappointment of the the device in my opinion. it isnâ€™t a terrible camera, actually it is a really capable shooter with 13mp w/ ois and an aperture of æ’2.0. the real killer is shutter lag, and meh camera app (get one from the play storeâ€¦). iâ€™m not a huge selfie shooter but if you are you may be disappointed due to it only having a 2mp shooter on the front. battery life originally i would have gave the battery life a 3 - 3.5, but since the update to marshmallow i can easily get a day of you out of it with 4-5 hours screen on time. price / value probably the most controversial issue is the price. originally when i first used the nexus 6, way back when i would have never forked over the money for it. i just didnâ€™t seem like $650 was the right price for what you are getting. now that it is $349 itâ€™s well worth it and i highly recommend it. it puts it in the price range of the middle to high end devices. in other words it a no brainer. if you want android in the purest form but donâ€™t want to break the bank for the nexus 6p get this. final thoughts: so the running question that i have been receiving a lot lately is why i went back to the nexus 6 over going to one of the newer devices or the nexus 6p. the simplest answer i can give is that itâ€™s the best value available. i doesnâ€™t have the best camera, nor the best display, battery life, processor / performance but, it just worksâ€¦ (kinda reminds me of another device that just works .   ). this phone is tight. any price below $350, this phone is unbeatable .   i purchased this phone to use with project fi. it works as well as can be expected from a high end phone, and a flag ship one at that. the phone updated to android marshmallow. it is the pure, unskinned version - the way google intended. there are no lags or gripes that i have using this phone other than that it is slightly too wide. it takes some getting used to .   speakers sound better than the nexus 6p, and you get wireless charging. motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 32gb, midnight blue (u.s. warranty)do not buy this phone .   i had this phone for about 2 weeks, if that. i was sitting in my chair and dropped it less than 2 feet (onto carpet) and the glass shattered at the bottom of the screen and chipped in the front on bottom where it hit. 3rd generation gorilla glass my butt .   first, they were suppose to send me the midnight blue phone .  instead, they sent me the gray one .  then after a less than a 2 foot drop onto carpet, it broke. do not trust them .   i am going back to sumsung who cares about customer satisfaction .   i spent all that money for nothing .   now, i have to buy another phone. they tried telling me to send it into them to see if it can be fixed. yeah right .   i'm not that stupid .   and while they have my phone, doing absolutely nothing to fix it. i'm stuck without one! go with sumsung .   do not use motorola .   thought it would be too big coming from nexus 5. it is too big, but you get used to it in a day and the nexus 5 seems too small .   i am using project fi this with nexus 6. it has performed well. the speed is fast. the 6 inch screen size is great. the battery lasts until about mid-afternoon time with heavy use and through the evening with moderate use. the battery life could be improved. the camera and picture taking indoors could be improved. android is my favorite part. i would buy this phone again though .   purchased this phone last month and for the most part, i've been satisfied with most aspects of the phone (battery life, functionality, usability, etc). however, i have already had two problems. from day one, occasionally the screen will malfunction where half of it does not line up with the other side. when i turn the screen off and then back on, it corrects the issue. then, today i was sitting on a sewer cap and the phone slipped out of my jacket onto the sewer. i went to pick it up to read a text and was shocked to find my screen cracked. i've dropped phones from many heights and had no damage. i don't event drop the phone, but rather it slips out of my pocket onto the sewer from a few inches and it cracks. customer service rep paul told me that they cannot do anything about could the split screen malfunction because i did not report it prior to the cracked screen. it would cost $175+taxes to repair the cracked screen. i'm incredibly disappointed with the durability of this phone. not happy about the situation. one last thing, as some others have mentioned issues with the back cover. i did notice from day one that part of the back screen is slightly raised relative to the rest of the cover .   it get hot easily. very slippy. it resolution is great in all, but lack support from other apps to use it full potential .   super fast. beautiful big, bright screen. nice build quality. upgradable to 6.0 marshmallow. works perfectly with my t-mobile pre-paid plan. i couldn't ask for anything more in my phone. recent price drops around the holidays make this phone quite a bargain. one of the best purchases i have made this year and is a great upgrade from my nexus 5 .   really good phone. i'm just going to talk about my personal experience with this phone coming from the oneplus one. since they're in similar brackets, i figure this might help someone make a choice between the two. i've had the oneplus one for over a year. good phone but plagued with software issues. then i saw the nexus 6 go on sale and thought this was a chance to try something new. nexus 6 is a nice phone. pretty much everything i don't like about it is small nitpick stuff that i can live without. but when it comes down to it, i would probably stayed with the oneplus one. i like big phones and nexus 6 is definitely a big phone. it feels solid. everything is tight and feels good. i can hold the phone nicely but it is on the big side if i want to wrap my hand over it. screen is sharp and beautiful and i found it to be snappy and fast. battery life feels good to me. usually after a 14 hour work day, i would have 60% battery life which is on par with my opo. i like the simple design. the camera and ring flash looks sleek even thought he ring flash is worthless and shouldn't be called a ring flash. the speakers on this thing is awesome. sound is full and deep. so here are my nitpicks. the screen is sharp and the colors are great but the screen is dimmer than the opo. there is an obvious yellow tint to the n6. i don't mind the yellow tint, i like warmer colors but it would have been better if the screen was brighter to make the yellows in whites less pronounced. i don't like the button placements on the n6. i would have preferred the power to be lower and the volume to be on the other side. holding the opo feels a whole lot better. i don't like how the n6 doesn't have an led light. just one glance at my opo phone and i know if i have a text, email, or if my phone is done charger. with the n6, i'd have to turn on the to see. additionally, i find it incredibly annoying with android 6.0 that there's no confirmation of plugging in the charger and no confirmation of turning up the volume. i find it annoying that i had to turn on hidden options to do simple things like showing the battery percentage. camera experience is nicer on the opo. n6 does a good job at taking quick photos though it takes longer to load. voice search on the n6 has gone off by itself quite a bit and it's pretty annoying. overall, this is a decent phone and i do like it much. multimedia experience on it is great. however, i found the day-to-day use is much more enjoyable on the opo especially now their software is getting more stable. i still have both and planning to sell one. i don't mind whichever sells first. they're great phones. but the n6 isn't a slam dunk over the opo if anyone is considering the two .   i bought this phone to use with tracfone's bring your own phone program. i used the tracfone (byop) sim activation kit and so far everything seems to work great. i was able to transfer my old phones minutes and service days to this phone. wow is this phone light years ahead from anything tracfone sells. i love the big bright clear screen and great camera. android marshmallow is a great step up from kit kat too. love the way it saves on battery life when the phone is just sitting around not being used. i don't feel the phone is too big. again i like the big screen. i know this is not the newest phone on the block, but it sure is much better than the phone i had, and will last me a long time if motorola builds a good phone? they seem like they do, but time will tell. in all money well spent to me .   its charging quite slowly. indeed through out the night it charged from 20% to 73% only and i am having this problem right from 1st day .   i ordered this phone during thanks giving deal. i received today and when i opened the box, i found some air bubbles and scratches on the screen protector layer provided on the device. not sure if it's a used device. i am skeptical if i had received new product or not .   got the bf deal and received phone today. it is a beautiful phone, love it. the only and big issue is the phone becomes pretty hot during charging. hope it can last me well. it came with android 5.5, and i just followed the below link to successfully upgrade my nexus 6 to android 6.0.1: http://www.techinfobit.com/manually-upgrade-nexus-7-to-android-marshmallow-6-0/. for the price i give 5 stars. i wish it had supported light notifications as a standard, without rooting! would be happier if it had worked similar to nexus 5 in terms of tethering with grandfathered att unlimited data plan. though i don't tether usually, i would like to have it available for an emergency. the first and main reason to root nexus 6! one the very first unfortunate fall, the screen cracked. had to shell out another $200 to have it fixed by motorola .   i previously owned a oneplus one and the nexus 6 is an improvement in almost every way except perhaps battery life, but this is more than made up for by the insanely fast charging of the nexus 6. pros: - the display (big, great colors, awesome resolution). - quick charging is a huge win and gets my nexus 6 up to full power faster than any device i've ever owned. - front facing speakers. - the device is fast. - no carriers to get in the way of timely os updates. - speaking of carriers, there is no carrier bloatware on this device. - phone reception is fantastic. in comparison, calls on my oneplus one were a mess and people constantly complained that they could not hear me, but on my nexus 6, i've never had a complaint about call quality. cons: - battery life could be better, but this is the price you pay for having such a big display. - display isn't as bright as i would like it to be which can be annoying on particularly sunny days. - camera doesn't take the greatest low light shots .   got this to give my old eyes some relief. it'll take some getting used too as it's bigger than any phone i've ever had. coming from a windows phone, android is alien, but i'll get used to it .   decent phone but the battery life sucks. i also wish thebpowe button was not on the side. it's touchy and right where i grab the phone. excellent. love the phone great condition, buy if you can .   picked up this phone on black friday for 199.99 at part of an amazon promotion. coming from the nexus 5 this is a familiar experience, but just a bit more refined. pros screen ( size, sharpness, and brightness) good camera in outdoor lightning very responsive zero lag turbo charging front facing speakers cons front facing camera is a bit lower quality that expected rear camera in low light environments this is a great for for the price. i would hesitate to get one at full price but if you can find anything under 250 its a steal. great buy, unless you are constantly taking low light photos this may not be the phone for you. p.s the phone is large but coming some a smaller device may require a bit of getting used to. it's a 2-handed device in most situations. but in my opinion the advantages of the size far outweigh the drawbacks .   great phone for its price that i payed for, which is $260. my wife needed a new phone so i decided to wait for black friday. i was very lucky to catch this sale because it sold out really fast. i have a lg g3 that my wife will be using now, because i thought the nexus 6 would be too big for her. i still think the lg g3 is more polished phone than this, in terms of little features like: different wallpaper for lock screen, customized icons, tap to unlock, etc. i would not buy this phone for its original price. but the specs are really good. if you like watching movies/videos, play games on a huge screen, the this phone will get the job done and more .   i like this phone .   i have had it about 3 months. purchased when it was priced below four benjamins .   the size is huge but i have quickly gotten use to it even though i am petite and have very small hands. i use it to read a lot, like a mini tablet. i bought a case that has a strap hole and put a strap on it so i don't worry about dropping it when taking pictures. the picture quality is pretty good but the google camera app does not focus smoothly and can be very frustrating at times. however, putting on hdr mode will allow very good shots in poor lighting. very nice screen. the 64 gb size is great for downloading tons of videos and music. the sound is excellent- these little speakers put out better sound than my laptop that's a few years old. strangely our household has a nexus 5 and 9 and they both got marshmallow already but this hasn't yet .   excellent product. great phone, however, at&t locked the phone to them as soon as i put their simcard into it. it's not amazon or the company i bought it off of. i am just saying that you might have to call your phone company to unlock it after installing a simcard. great phone, would recommend it because it is pure android. doesn't have carrier or manufacturer bloatware, which is a huge plus .   great phone. device received is defective out of the box. device keep crashing with message, "unfortunately google app has stopped." even i hit ok over 20 times message with continue to pop up. i am very disappointed with this item .   amazing phone, i have iphone 6, bought this for my mom and its lightning fast with awesome camera. great phone, total value for phone. very impressed with motorola, this is comeback phone .   awesome phone if you are looking for a phablet and don't want to waste a lot of money. i was lucky to got a nice deal at amazon  .   so make sure don't forget to see today's deals ::) saved my 100 bucks running android 6 , google always rocks  .   this time motorola has given some decent hardware to back up the google sws. it would have been really nice if there could have a fingerprint sensor instead of m symbol at back --- overall a great phone  .   super. absolutely love this phone. i have been a iphone user for many years but this phone is so far above and beyond anything i expected .   good phone. exactly as described. i recommend it. one package was already opened.one was fine.not satisfied with all. i've had my eye on this phone since the specs were first published and finally pulled the trigger and bought it on amazon. wow. everything about this phone is very nicely done. the look/feel/functionality is exceptional and the screen real estate is perfect. i'm so glad i decided to step up from the run-of-the-mill size phones .   like this phone although i thought i would love stock android and nexus. still at $199 for a black friday deal, i can't complain (too much). here are a few glaring issues i have with this phone after a weeks use. * the phone has a yellow toned screen, not off white not cream colored but yellowish. this is apparently noticeable when held next to my previous phone, the lg g2. i'm not a big fan of the warmer tone as it makes the screen seems dirty and also lowers the vivid colors and resolution in my opinion. this is an apparent issue across the board with the nexus 6. i should have researched a bit more prior to purchasing it. * when running multiple apps, there is no option to "clear all" at once. you have to manually swipe each window you want to close. time consuming to say the least and quite inconvenient. * has a pretty strong vibration which cannot be adjusted or softened. this is very annoying and almost a deal breaker for me. i don't want my phone to be buzzing loud with every notification. this sucks hard! * google camera is almost too plain and simple. but the worst part is the annoying shutter sound which cannot be muted or changed. it doesn't even have your standard shutter sound, instead you get an annoying "blip" sound. super wack! * google photos is too minimal with very few options. there are no enhance settings or the ability to crop photos. you have to download a third party app to get all those nice features. lame! * the charging port is upside down for whatever reason. motorola decided they wanted to be cool and different on this one and it takes getting used to. it just doesn't feel right, it's like learning to write from right to left, no thanks. hell no! * while stock android is minimal and nice, it seems almost too plain with few options. don't get me wrong i like it and the few things it has it does extremely well but sometimes i miss having those extra options the company skins provides, especially in regards to widgets. * camera is just ok. my lg g2 takes better pictures. overall i like the device but those are a few glaring issues that would make anyone think twice about it. yes i love the big screen, stock android with the fastest updates but in all honesty i wouldn't of paid regular price for it. good thing i got in on sale otherwise i would have returned it .   update: after using it for few more weeks i decided to send it back, the biggest disappointment turned out to be poor battery life and occasional heating just on & off. the heating likely is causing the back cover to fail which is glued. battery life is not any better than galaxy s4. hope was that the phone will run longer without at&t and touchwiz although phone is zippy compare to s4. the back cover has big enough gaps almost all around the phone out of the box , not sure if that affects the durability of the phone but this is disappointing to see on a flagship device. it's gonna trap a lot of dust. everything else is great battery, screen, software, performance except front speaker are just ok .   overall review. $199.99 and battery life made the deal for me on this phone. plus big 6inch screen that i try to use with one hand, my thumb is getting exercise & getting longer each day. amazing phone .   great deal on this. dumped lousy sprint and got on project fi. saving a lot of money, better service .   the nexus 6 run's perfectly, fast and smooth and the amoled panel is awesome, but .   after only one month of light use that gorgeous display has some image retention or burn-in and that is in excusable. i should have sent it back as soon as i noticed it .   nice price nice phone. yet to be activated, so will update review later, but just a few warnings when ordering. seems like a great phone so far in terms of operation (easy app/data migration from prior android phone; wifi setup was easy, though long .  ). **but** shipped with an old version of the os (an early version of lollipop), so it took nearly 2 hours to finish setting up as each successive update downloaded and installed and optimized the apps which copied over first. (ended up with the latest marshmallow release.) **and** does not ship with a sim card. i'm a sprint customer and my old android did not have a (removable) nano-sim card to transfer, so i needed to call to get one. (i couldn't find a sprint store in nyc that had one.) the sprint "orders" department told me they didn't have them, either, but transferred me to "order support" who said it was no problem and they'd ship me one to arrive in 1-3 days. be sure you get the right department on the phone! (not the new phone, of course, as it doesn't yet have a sim card and can only be used for wifi data, not phone calls!). great phone. it's a nexus so you always have the latest from google. this phone has an amazing camera, if you are worried about bad low-light shots hdr+ and the dual-led flash compensate for this. my recommended case would be aâ nexus 6 case, supcase [heavy duty] belt clip holster case for google nexus 6 (2014 release) [unicorn beetle pro series] full-body rugged hybrid protective cover with built-in screen protector (black/black), dual layer design + impact resistant bumper, fit motorola nexus 6â this phone has left me with 40-50% battery when going to bed. definetely a good choice for this price after 2015's disappointing flagships .   got the phone on sale, couldn't be happier .   tl;dr phone had crack in screen, told motorola, cost to fix was $0, motorola had phone for week and repair status was "inprogress", called to see how it was going and was informed that they wouldn't do anything until i paid a fee. i love my nexus 6. it is a great phone. i have noticed online that other people have had issues with the screen cracking, and unfortunately i became one of them. i contacted motorola through their repair website, and entered in detailed information about the damage to the phone. it was very clear from the selections that i made that this was physical damage to the screen. i was given a confirmation number, and a cost of $0 for the repair. no credit card information was taken, and there was no mention of payments or fees. i was also told i would have a phone back within 4-5 business days. all of this was smooth as butter. they emailed me a fedex label, and i sent my phone back to motorola. everything seemed fine. a few days go by, and then it was the holiday weekend so i assumed that it would take a bit of extra time. every day i would go to motorola's website and check on the status, which after a couple days showed up as "inprogress", which i took to mean that the repair/replacement was in progress. after it had been almost two weeks i decided to give them a call to see if they had an eta on the repair. they informed me that there was no work order open for the phone, since there hadn't been a fee collected for the physical damage. so, not only were they not upfront about this fee, they gave me a price of 0$, accepted the phone through the mail, and never bothered to contact me about their decision to not do anything with it. i spent an hour and 22 minutes on the phone, talking with 4 different motorola employees, and none of them could help me out. they admitted that they shouldn't have been able to even collect the phone with it being physically damaged without the fee being paid, and that the online system shouldn't have been able to let me get a shipping label. so something went wrong on their end. this kind of stuff happens, i get it. but now they have my phone, admitted they made a mistake, yet they won't honor or acknowledge the information i was given when i made the decision to send them my device. so, my phone is essentially a hostage, and motorola is demanding ransom for repairs. they ship it back to me in the slowest way possible, but they won't even send it back with overnight shipping since they seem to see no problem with what they have done. i am appalled at their attempts at customer service, and how no one seems to be able to or even care about helping me .   this phone is outstanding. to my surprise, the larger size is actually an asset, and makes typing, browsing, and streaming, faster and more convenient than my previous pocket phones ever could. what you lose in "cuteness" you make up in functionality. the one drawback is activation. verizon customers: prepare to do battle. this phone is unlocked, meaning it can be assigned to any network. but if your verizon rep is a dud, like mine , they'll tell you it can't be used. they'll plug in your imei, see if it's already in the verizon network (which it won't be), and tell you to get lost. never fear! request to speak with tech support, or a rep that is familiar with unlocked phones. all they need to do is activate a sim card in another phone (my rep used a floor model) then transfer that sim to your phone. done! you're in network. the process of finding a rep that knew this took about an hour, but the actual activation takes less than a minute. given the awesomeness of this phone, the time spent was well worth it .   great flagship nexus from google in 2014. and amazing price by amazon .   great phone. highly recommend .   best no contract unlocked phone out there. stock android, durable, plenty of space for what you need. for the prices on here it's a steal .   loving this phone .   do some research if you haven't already and you'll find that this phone rivals any of the best phones of 2015 for a fraction of the price. it isn't perfect in every category but it is entirely enough phone for the average user. i was initially concerned with the size but have quickly learned to appreciate it. the screen is amazing, it's lightning fast, and the battery is great! the day it arrived i was immediately updated to android 6.0(marshmallow), which was released only days prior. being androids flagship phone, this will always get the updates first which is a huge perk for me as i love having the newest and best! i am using this phone with verizon prepaid (allset) and it works great. i just walked into a verizon store and they put the nano sim card and activated it for me, free. would highly recommend this phone .   it takes time for starting up, some times suddenly needs restart and after restart takes up too 5 min to recover .   went to verizon and 5 minutes later had it all set up .   $200 on black friday .   my very first smart phone. took a few hours for me to figure out how this phone works. this is my portable video player right here .   love this phone. i bought my last phone used in 2013, so when i finally bought the nexus 6, i couldn't believe how much android had advanced and how many cool features i'd been missing out on. at first i thought the phablet size was a problem, but now i cant' see myself going back to a smalller screen. i love the phone and it's a perfect conversation starter. i work near a college campus and and it's always fun to hear the college girls exclaim "wow, i've never seen one that big before!". good case. thin and light .   great product , cant wait to have it. best cell phone ever, great seller  .   excellent black friday deal, fast shipping, excellent service, and awesome device. i switched from an iphone 5 and the camera megapixel difference is astounding! still learning this phone and android set up, but absolutely love it .   awesome phone, just buy it. i'll skip over the specs which i am sure you have already read many times over. what held me back was size but now that i have used this for two months i emphatically can say that i wish i did not wait this long before getting a phone this size. i jumped from a samsung galaxy s4 to this and remember all of the iphone fan boys telling me that was too big at the time and of course now apple is following the trend with larger devices. with this phone it's easier for me to text, use apps, read (news, social, web pages, etc) and i find that i am getting more value out of my large verizon payment every month.the phone works flawlessly, charges fast and is absolutely pocketable as long as you are not petite and wearing skinny jeans (i don't). phone is also fast and charges very quickly with the packaged charger. also be sure to pick up a car charger if you travel (the one that supports rapid charging) and you will never have a dead battery. this thing is always ready to go! buy it! do it .   buy it as a 24-hour discount on black friday (luckily, i got it). at first sight, it is really huge (in comparison with my iphone). but after a day using, now i am familiar with it. fit in my jean pocket (even with case cover). very high quality screen, and the two stereo speakers are so wonderful. in addition, it has been upgraded to android 6.0. :). huge screen, fast and nothing but pure google! no junk/bloatware attached! i couldn't ask for a lot more in a phone .   i need saler contact with me , the reason i give them only 1 star because when i got the device try to set this phone , the screen rotation didn't work , phone speaker not work either, i know how to use an android phone . i just need some contact me and help me make a replacement for my device , thanks  .   got 2 of these for 200$ each.awesome phone worth the price. the phone i received was the us version compatible with google fi. the only reason for 4 stars is the size. it's awkward to carry in a pants or coat pocket and my thumb can't reach completely to the opposite side of the screen while palming it. ps: google fi rocks .   great phone, just buy it if you can .   really good deal .   awesome price. it is really tight on the phone but i suppose it has to be to protect it .   oh what a nice wonderful phone .   it is was easy to add to my existing phone service too! the camera is extreme! love it! price really great too! i wanted to get an iphone and i am glad i didn't get one and bought the nexus 6 instead .   awesome phone. very good phone. have had the phone since july 2015 and my fully charged battery does not even last 3 hours now. a hairline crack on the screen has appeared although the phone is protected and i have not had a drop .   big and i love it. it has a beautiful screen and so much space. i am playing so many games .   product advertised as usable on verizon network. nope. i did a 2 hour run around ending without access. since i bought this on black friday ($200 = great deal), i can return the product .   but i can't get the same exact phone from best buy --- which is locked --- but would be active on the verizon network .   derp .   this is a great phone, totally unlocked. works great and still fits in my shirt pocket. went from nexus 5 to this nexus 6 .   perfect for my husband with huge hands. converted my iphone addicted husband to android. thank you! oh yeah, and it gave me a little phone envy too .   i have always been an iphone person, but this phone is great. the screen is super bright, fast and easy to use. the battery last me all day. so far i have been able to use all the apps i needed and found some great new one .   i got this phone and i'm enjoying it thus far delivered in good condition the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was due to 1 accessory not being included(headset). however all other necessary accessories usb,charger, pin to open sim slot were included so i'm happy with this purchase. can't believe i was able to get this phone for $199 on black friday! my daughter wanted a new phone and her tastes for phones is getting a little expensive these days and i've already owned the nexus 5 for two years so i already knew about the nexus 6 and how good it was, so when i saw this phone go on sale friday morning i jumped all over it! item arrived in 2 days and i've already opened and tested it and it works with no issues .   great phone! it's 2015, but this late 2014 still runs strong. google has already pushed the marshmallow 6.0 update to this device .   love it, best mobile i ever used. awesome. i gave the nexus 6 5 stars because it is truly an awesome device! the 5.96" amoled display is beautiful, the dual stereo speakers sound great and are super loud, the sd 805 coupled with 3gb of ram is super fast and snappy, and 32gb of storage standard is plenty for the average user. i chose the nexus 6 over the newer 5x and 6p! i like the design and build of the motorola nexus 6. also, qualcomm dropped the ball bad with the sd 808 and 810. i refuse to buy a device with either! i will wait for the 820, which is going to be an excellent soc! i however, received a device that would not power on unfortunately. it happens though .   got the 64gb model for $259 black friday special. was able to activate on sprint without issues. just went online and it recognized the imei immediately. i had an extra nano sim from sprint, so i popped that in and was running in no time. the phone appears to keep lte signal better than my htc one phone, so i am pleased. it is a bit large, but not very bothersome. the screen is amazing and vibrant. overall, a great buy, even at $399 .   is not unlocked, be careful. love it, i came from the samsung line of phones (loved the note line), which are still great, but with no bloatware this was perfect and many great features built in .   just for $199 a nexus 6, wow .   best deal in town. i highly recommend this phone. got two of these on black friday on sale for $200, great phone for great prices .   i got a faulty phone that did not work. as i first turned it on, it kept freezing, couldn't find activate the wifi or anything. once i got past that, it just kept rebooting indefinitely until it ran out of battery. what a waste. seemed like a fine phone .   for the price this phone is selling for this is a must buy for android fans. i have used nexus phone since i saved up for my first smartphone the nexus 4. i had the pleasure of owning the 5 and now i have the pleasure of owning the 6. marshmallow has done nothing but improve my experience and i am loving the support google extends to there legacy devices. yes its big but thats why its awesome. its the do everything pocket pc with wireless charging to boot! looking at you new nexus devices wth .   i have had the nexus 6 for about three weeks now and here are my thoughts .   the phone is big. i don't have very long fingers, but despite that, i am not finding it all that much of a problem to use. i really wasn't sure i would like the larger phablet. my prior phone was the nexus 5, which i loved, but it was getting a little long in the tooth. i picked up the nexus 6 during the recent discounting, and bought the 64gb version to get the additional space. i was initially disappointed that it came with 5.0 android. i quickly got updates bringing the phone to 5.1.1, which made be feel better, but i still missed marshmallow, which i had on the nexus 5. after a few weeks the marshmallow update finally made it to the nexus 6 and now i am happy again. loving 6.0 on nexus 6. the hardware of the phone really seems good and solid. the curved back is slightly odd, but i think it probably does help with the bigger screen. some of the most obvious good points start with the battery. i'm am floored by the battery life with this phone. it sometimes says four days left on battery. after a full day of normal use, it usually makes it down to 70 or 80% of full. the charging time is stellar; it doesn't seem to take 15 or 20 minutes for me to top it off. after watching a video on the phone it was predicting another 17 of video hours left based on the trend. the camera takes some amazing resolution pictures .   and makes big files as one might expect. i've already gotten some amazing pictures and the zoom-in capability is stunning. i am on the t-mobile network and wifi calling is a great new feature i've already used. it works far smoother than skype and solves a signal problem i have at one of my locations. i wasn't even aware the phone had support for it, but now i am, and quite happy with it, and it was so simple to enable it. so easy to use. i've had not problems with the phone, and at the discounted price i am very satisfied. i wasn't willing to go with the original price, but halving the price made this phone an easy choice, i have definitely not regretted .   i received phone not brand new,there are a lot of fingerprints on the back. awesome phone, easy to use, great versatility for everyday needs .   i got this phone for my husband as a second phone. he use an iphone 6 plus and wanted an android phone to use some of the apps that we paid for- home security etc. he loves it. its pure google, just like ios you dont have to wait for any updates. its a pity that people pay over $600 for the samsung, lg and htcs but its full of bloatware, manufacturer and carrier both. also there are people who paid top dollar for last years top samsung ans still waiting for the latest android 6.0 update. his phone already got the 6.0 update and he loves it .   this phone has a very nice oled screen and front firing dual speakers. battery life is really good and reception and call quality excellent. we jumped in on the bf deal and couldnt be happier. all these phones lose value in less than a year and i'm sure todays latest and greatest will be available cheap next year. until then we are set .   the other phones which have pure google are the motorola made moto models and they are also not getting any 6.0 update anytime soon. forget about the lg nexus 5, its quite old and mediocre hardware .   new device right out of the box could not charge even though the lightning bolt indicator is there. battery management shows "not charging". contacted tech support and they had no idea why this happened. switched between different chargers/cables/pcs, and none helped. the usb connection looked fine, and i was able to transfer files between pc and phone using the usb cable. battery drained to 10% while it was plugged .   then i finally gave up and initiated return request .   device as advertised, extremely fast free shipping .   love the phone .   i've gone thru a lot of phones. iphone 6s plus galaxy s6 edge plus m8 moto x pure/style note 4 etc it's good for an older phone and a cheap price. my favorite phone ever. now i don't need to carry a phone and a tablet. this is a large phone/tablet, but it is a google product which means it has straight android and gets the updates first. i am switching to google fi for my phone company in january and this is one of the only phones that you can use on their system. takes really good photos, has strong sound, very clear phone reception and send (on verizon). does work on verizon by the way. no problem and my phone bill dropped as i bought my own phone. big item is that this has wireless charging which google dropped in their newest releases. stupid . . . my wife and i will not buy any phone that doesn't have wireless charging. so now i have this phone and another in reserve for when this one breaks .   the phone came in great shape. no wear or tear, no issues with the phone at all either. â˜º the phone came earlier than i had expected and the owner was very corporative .   it's huge. yes. but it's awesome. it uses the last of the krait based socs (clocked at 2.7 ghz). this phone is a great way to say goodbye to the 32-bit mobile era (whose demise came too soon, thanks apple!). i'm using this with google fi, and the hardware/software experience has been great for the last few weeks. the phone is extremely responsive, and the amoled screen seems to save power, even though the screen is massive. wireless charging works great with some nokia dt-900 chargers. the quick charge is impressive. i had to shuffle things around my pockets to fit the phone, since my wallet and phone would create a rather unsightly bulge in my pants. the camera is good, not great. the shutter lag is disappointing, but i've never considered camera phones that great for android, unless you have an apple iphone (or windows phone for that matter). battery life is stellar. i can eek out 2 days use pretty easily (moderate use). it helps to have a android wear watch, since you reduce your screen unlock/re-lock and just look at the watch instead. gps lock time is stellar, as it has been for the last generation or two of phones. speakerphone quality is good. bluetooth pairs quickly and reliably. the vibrate is way too loud though. the nexus 4 vibrate was soothing, but maybe too subtle. it would be nice to have an option to adjust the vibration intensity. right now, it's set to earthquake mode. it's rather embarrassing in meetings, and it coincides with me going completely wide-eyes, so it's extra awkward when everyone stares at me .   this phone is huge! if you are looking for a massive phone then this phone is for you. its fast and for the price i got it for on black friday, it was a steal .   i have only had the phone for a full day but love it so far. one of my previous phones was a nexus 5 ahich i fell in love with. snagged it on sale during black friday. it is a very big phone but my previous phone was a note 3 so the size was not a problem. i have not played with it as much as i would like and will update this review later after more use .   not recommended. keeps offering an update but never updates when accepted. otherwise pretty cool .   item arrived obviously previously opened. it has a defective screen that flickers constantly. after doing the system updates. now it will not work at all. motorola makes junk. amazon will only offer refund and not replacement. was on a great sale at the time. i am sure i will never buy another thing from amazon again. it is clear they have no intention of helping a customer out. and just so i can keep this on point. i was not that impressed with the phone. it got very hot while doing updates. the camera is not that great and it was hard to do anything with it sitting on a table because it would rock back and forth .   great phone for the price. works perfectly on at&t. just be aware that you will probably have to manually flash to marshmallow since at&t gets in the way of the update. kind of a bummer since this is an unlocked phone .   i bought a warehouse deal unit for a great price, and it arrived. the box was superficially damaged, which is to be expected with warehouse deal items. the phone itself was in perfect physical and working condition. i love the huge screen, and with the dual front facing speakers, make for the best media experience on any phone i've used. battery life is pretty good, but not great. while there is no expandable memory, 64 gb plus google's cloud storage make it unnecessary. the phone is very fast, and as usual with nexus devices, free of any carrier branding or bloatware. i've had the phone about 6 months now, and still loving it .   great sized phone . the large kb allows my clumsy figures to type more accurately. the photo and video quality is great for a phone. i was on a verizon pre-paid plan before i bought this phone. i plugged in a nano-chip for verizon and my install went smoothly after i called verizon. i had to call verizon because my old motorola g was a 3g phone and this is 4lgte. they can't activate from a 3g phone plan to 4g phone plan via their website. you need to talk to a human. they were really nice.( i do need to charge it at the end of each day.). cons: this is sort of going to sound like a rant, my apologies. i ordered a phone when amazon listed it for $400 (64gb, cloud white). had a few issues. the camera was complete garbage and every shot was dark. the batty life was abysmal. the screen has discoloration all over the right side of it (i have removed the screen protector just to ensure that it wasn't the screen protector causing this problem). so i returned it and promptly bought another. the screen didn't have issues on the second one, but a letter was bent in on the backing "nexus" and was starting to come up. i have no clue how this ever happened because the box was sealed. now i'm returning it and have purchased my third nexus 6. i did notice that the battery life was nothing like it was compared to my first order (maybe it was an actual issue with the battery). the screen has discoloration at the bottom of the third one, but screw it. i can tolerate this one more than my first one. quality control is nonexistent for these. a couple of other cons i think are no microsd slot (luckily the 64gb version is cheap), and its hard to find a place to put my phone in my car lol. the phone is also really wide and makes it damn near impossible to do much with one hand. pros: screen size is awesome for web surfing. i prefer it over my laptop. battery life is great when nothing is actually wrong with the battery. it's a nexus so you're first in line for android updates. i was skeptical of the processor included on this phone but i have no gripes with it so far. typing is pretty easy on the larger screen. the phone is pretty thin and fits well in pockets. i love that they raised the back end of the phone more at the top so that the camera remains flush with the body and is not protruding like most phone's cameras do nowadays. the speakers are the best i've ever heard on any phone. android marshmallow is great. comes with a turbo charger .   64gb for cheap. this phone has turbo charging which is a huge lifesaver for a battery this big. this phone also includes wireless charging which was a requirement for me! thank you motorola for including this! once you really get used to using wireless charging (i have 3 throughout my house and one at work), you won't want to charge your phone any other way. all in all, this phone is worth it. if you get a lemon, the return process is great and you can order another one before sending yours back so you don't have to go without a phone. thank you amazon for this great policy .   amazing device, and price. works flawlessly on att network. the missing star is for the lack of micro sd card slot, my kid's moto g 3rd gen has one, so no excuse .   fast delivery. item as described .   so far so good .   i still had been using an older iphone, 4s and it was beginning to have some software issues, freezing up, etc. decided it had been time to upgrade to a new phone, checked out reviews on new phones and my girlfriend had a nexus 5. with the reviews, many had said that the nexus 6 is a top notch phone. also my girlfriend being very happy with her nexus 5, having toyed around with her phone, decided on the nexus 6 from motorola via amazon. i couldn't be happier, the nexus 6 is a fantastic mobile device. from the shape of the phone, it's speed (it is fast), video quality and really loving it's sound quality. i'm very big on having music to listen to as i take a train daily with a total of 3 hours commute time. i picked up the sennheiser cx 300 ii earbuds and i'm highly impressed with the sound that comes out of the nexus 6, sennheiser earbuds combo. battery life is excellent, plenty of storage space with 32 gigs, all the options that comes with having an android phone, it allows for so much control of their software and no bloatware. all apps run smoothly, os (lollipop) runs smoothly, hardware and software controls run smoothly. the only issue i did have had nothing to do with the phone itself, it had to do with using verizon as a carrier. i have read that it shouldn't be an issue to bring an unlocked nexus 6 to verizon but i had called them directly, their customer service and one of their local stores, they said they didn't support the unlocked nexus 6. thought maybe it's because they now have their own verizon, nexus 6? which they're charging twice as much as you can get the nexus 6 here on amazon. in any case, i went to a local at&t store, had the phone up and running in 10 minutes. i actually have a better deal now with using at&t, unlimited calls, texting (internationally too) and 4 gigs of data per month. whatever data i do not use, carries over to the next month. with verizon i had unlimited calls, texts (domestic) and 1 gig of data for $12 less per month. still may try out project fi, i encounter coverage issues in northeastern nj and in nyc with at&t. i like the nexus 6 so much that i bought an additional nexus 6 one a week ago for my girlfriend as a christmas gift. i highly recommend the nexus 6 all around, quality build and brand, quality hardware, quality software which in turn provides excellent sound and video. everything is fantastic about this phone, you definitely won't be disappointed .   fantastic, fast, gorgeous phone. i was afraid it might be too large for my smallish hands but it didn't take me any time at all to get used to it. i've had smartphones for years, all htc, and even though i loved them all, there isn't an htc phone out right now that i'd buy. samsung is out because i have a new samsung tablet and i don't like touchwiz at all. too much extra junk on samsung tablets and phones that just slows the device down. googles nexus 6 phone is very vanilla but you can spruce it up to your heart's content with any app you like. i bought the white 64 gb version and it's a beautiful phone. i'd buy it again. pros easy to see fast, fast, fast pure vanilla android long lasting battery super fast charging stereo speakers cons the speakers aren't quite htc quality but they're still very good .   its big. this device has multiple issues. following are the issues i have experienced with my original purchase and the replacement i have received. you can google every single issue that i have experienced. there are hundreds of people complaining about every single issue. i liked the phone, so i wanted to keep it, but new issues keep on appearing and i was unable to troubleshoot most of them. this phone is only good for texting or web browsing. it is not made for making phone calls. i love amazon for their customer service and support. they helped me a lot in replacement and return process. 1. static noise / hissing sound - you can hear static noise when making phone calls. these noises are gone if you use bluetooth to make calls. i ended up requesting a replacement and the replacement had the same issue. most of us wonâ€™t pay attention to the call quality, but this phone is supposed to make hd sound quality phone calls. no one on the amazon reviews has mentioned this issue. 2. no ringing when you make a phone call to some numbers - this is a very strange issue. you will not hear any ring if you call or you hear only one ring then phone goes silent until someone answers on the other end. you are not sure if the call is going through or no, but in reality the phone is ringing on the other end. it does not happen with all the numbers. this is very annoying. 3. no notification numbers - you will not see how many emails you have or how many messages you have received because apps do not show notification numbers. 4. cannot block numbers - you cannot send a number into block list on this phone unless you add the number into contacts and then send the calls from the number to voice mail. 5. pink hue - this is not a big issue, but it is there. screen turns pink under minimal light setting. only visible in dark. 6. takes long / stuck on factory reset - this phone takes long if you do factory reset. some of the people complaining about phone never turning on after factory reset. mine took 30 mins. i had to do reset prior to sending it back. if you have used brand names like - samsung or apple, this phone is not for you .   its a great phone i love it, the service was great :). wonderful, reliable, easy to use, and the best phone i have ever used .   super good black friday deal for $199.99. incredible phone. best smart phone for this price (350)i was looking also for a moto x (more expensive) and the asus (less expensive) finally i decide for nexus, because i come from nexus 5 and the upgrades and "simbiosis" between os and device are incredible. battery life is so good and display is sharp and clean .   amazing phone but why dosent it download to new 6.0 marshmallow. it's november 27. initially, i could not be happier! i've had this phone for 1 week now. i came from samsung gs-iii. sooo nice to have this upgraded, unlocked and and soon to be project fi phone. and, thanks amazon for the solid you did for me. very happy amazon prime customer. solid phone choice since switching over from iphone. there was a bit of discomfort of adjusting to android versus ios, but i'm adaptable. the experience with phone has been phenomenal. it's fast, screen looks brilliant, and it just feels like a grown man's phone .   got my nexus 6 works very well and omg this phone is fast and sappy wow the snapdragon 805 performance is on top .   the phone is alright nice battery life camera is alright also amazon selling this device is a little concerning due to the fact i bought this item less than 7 days ago for 339 32gb version and now today they are selling the same phone but 64gb version for 259.99 when taking with a rep they couldnt do anything for me in the case of giving me the difference or even offering to send me the 64gb version instead but nothing at all just saying sorry for your troubles amazon is always great and ready to help but in this case poor customer service this is unsatisfactory. bought this when it was on sale for $400. upgrading from a nexus 5. this phone is a beast. fast, no lag in programs. beautiful finish on the phone chassis. awesome display. isn't really as big as a lot of people think it is. fits perfect in your hand. totally worth the money to buy it .   nice phone. i absolutely love this phone! excellent build quality, stock android, great value for the $$$ and it works great with project fi. the only con is i am still waiting for android 6.0 upgrade .   had this phone for over a month now. coming from an iphone 5 to this is amazing. i flip flop from iphones to andriod on a regular and i have to say andriod has come a long way. the last andriod phone i had was running ice cream sandwich and back then battery life was an issue. but with this phone. i have np problems. i can have this phone on all day and after a long day. ill be home to charge it. if you wanna get into the phablet market this is a great phone for you .   fantastic phone. love it! my nexus 5 was dropped into water so i have to buy a new one.i still choose nexus cell phone. the camera is much better than 5 and the screen is much bigger. good deal .   this is my first android phone and i couldn't be happier. this is a high end phone with great specs and is priced right. i bought mine at amazon but this phone is currently available for less than $300 on new egg. highly recommend this phone if you are considering a phablet .   received an opened box, not sure if this was a refurbished item, but the description does specify new. the plastic cover did not stick very well and was dirty. the sim tool was loose in the box. the phone works well, i was surprised to see that the notification led is not working, most likely an android 6 issue .   i love it very much. charge port is slightly off of center. makes plugging in charger slightly harder than it should be .   the best phone i have ever used. but, i bought this assuming that nexus will be the first to receive the latest software(marshmallow) from google. but, i being on at&t is at mercy of the my provider rather than google. a huge disappointment on that front and hence 4*. else, this deserves 5 * phone. for those moving from 5 inch phones, the size might feel huge and takes some time to get adjusted. once you get used, the other phones looks like minions :). great phone. larger than most, but that's what i wanted .   for the price the nexus 6 is going for on amazon now, you can't beat this device! coming from a 2014 moto x that is always advertised as being as close to "stock android" as you can get, i can tell you there's no substitute for real stock android! running the latest android 6.0 marshmallow, the nexus 6 is as smooth and fast as any smart phone i've ever seen. in comparison to the newest droid turbo 2, it is still much smoother. i've yet to see the new nexus 6p in person, but for the price difference, i'm in no rush to upgrade .   this phone had decent battery life; not great not bad either. had to return it because of the display quality. it is impossible to read anything on it at night; it turns pink and if you turn off the adaptive brightness it becomes too bright even on the lowest setting. the speakers are amazing tho. like super loud and super high quality. this phone is worth it if you don't care about the display quality and the battery life .   this phone is very bold and beautiful. love every moment i use it .   its ok. great phone for the price. the nexus 6 may be last years model, but it is fast and seems very well made. i previously used a samsung gs4 for 3 years, and the overall software may be a little more sophisticated on the gs models. however, the newer samsungs are $650+, and for what i do, this fits the bill. i bought the phone for $261 used like new from battery assualt a third party seller, and am very pleased with the delivery speed and the build quality of the motorola phone. the 6' screen take some adjusting to, but after a couple weeks, i am getting used to it. i am pleased with the battery life as i can get 3 days of my normal use. i turn it off at night, and that probably helps. at this price, i can upgrade in a year or two and not be out $600-$700. if you are looking for a phone that is worth what it cost, then this is it. i have nothing against the iphone or the other premium ones on the marked, but i like android and the other $400 doesn't make the phone function any better .   great phone, price, battery life, and updates straight from google. went from a nexus 5 to this phone and wouldn't go back. if you are unsure about the size of the phone, you really should just get it. took some getting used to but now i love it .   perfect cellphone. even a year after release, the nexus 6 is still a solid choice for those looking for a reasonably priced phone that performs well: pros: +stock android, get your updates quickly +no custom overlays or carrier bloatware bogging down the phone +runs smoother than some higher end phones +excellent battery life since android 6.0 marshmallow +awesome quad hd amoled screen displays deep blacks, saturated colors +excellent placement of power/volume keys, they give a nice tactile feedback +u.s. version is unlocked and works verizon as well as gsm carriers. observations: =this phone is huge, but after awhile you get used to it. probably best for large hands. =while the camera is very good, some 2015 models are quite a bit ahead now with detail and options. =while the amoled screen is great, it does have yellow or pink hues depending on brightness settings; several 2015 models have more consistent and brighter white displays. =midnight blue back is a fingerprint magnet, and matte finish wears smooth with extended use, a case is recommended =while the curved shape makes the phone easier to hold, it wobbles when texting on a table. all in all, the nexus 6 seems to hold it's own. 2015 has brought advancements to camera quality, screen quality and a bump to 4 gb of ram. if the absolute best camera quality is your number 1 priority, you might look elsewhere. given that most 2015 advancements were fine tuning already amazing features, the nexus 6 is plenty powerful and feature packed, even now. if size is a concern, i recommend seeing the phone in person at a local carrier store. this is a great choice for those who doesn't want (or have the option of) a 2 year contract. 2015 flagship phablets often run $500-700 so this is a great deal on a solid phone .   i'm absolutely loving this phone, at this price it must be the best option around. loving it .   have had nothing but a great experience with this phone. quick delivery and phone is the one normally sold by google themselves .   its not what i was looking for as battery life is #1 but its a decent phone if you don't mind charging it throughout the day. if you have been considering this phone for a while but were unsure if a phone of this size would be good for you, your concerns weren't misplaced. this is a huge phone and you need big hands to operate this phone. but apart from that, there's very little downside to this phone. this is a snappy phone, which has a battery that you'd find hard to discharge within a day, no matter how heavy you use it. has a great display (supposed to be 4k) and great build quality. the biggest advantage of this phone is that you have stock android running on a very powerful hardware and lots of ram. the result is everything just works seamlessly and app response times are very quick. go for it if you were already considering this phone. now more than ever because it's more bang for your buck. this really is a great phone and the hardware+software (stock android) combination is what makes it so great .   great .   decent phone. only gripe is the camera can't autofocus when taking video. this is a problem for fast moving video as it will be a blur. you have to stop and let it focus .   great as soon as i learn how to use it. i received black & wanted midnight blue .   learning all about it. the price was right and i love the no bloatware. this phone has not been the best i've ever had but it is the one that works on google fi. the battery life is lacking and that is my main complaint. the rapid charger is a great thing, i highly recommend investing in the car rapid charger. other than that, it's a normal phone. good investment, could be better .   love. everything i want. my favorite smart phone so far. haven't used the new nexus 6p but i like it much more than the lg g4 that i had before .   so far i am very happy with the nexus 6. no issues, nice large screen and can be upgraded to marshmallow os. its all google with no unnecessary applications preinstalled .   pretty good .   love the phone but its a bit big. but i knew that .   best phone ever purchase. it updates everyday and i don't understand why, it is too big and not as fast as i expected. i'm not happy with this phone. i'm selling it and switching to something less bulky .   kind of big, but for the cost i got it at a pretty good unlocked phone. came from a gs3 so the more pure google interface took some getting used to .   as described. the bomb! i love this phone .   the best phone i ever had .   0/10. phone was as stated and delivered timely. would give 5th star of the cord to charge wasn't the cheapest you could find, never worked, but why contact for another cheap broken cord .   i am 100% disappointed with this phone. i had high expectations given that both google and motorola are usually reliable. however i found out the hard way that this phone comes with a defect: it re-starts itself randomly several times a day for no reason. i looked it up online and found several complaints about the same problem. i tried deleting all third party apps and running the phone for a while and the reboots kept happening. i even noticed that the phone would reboot itself most of the times i tried to use an app that came with the phone. you would think maybe i downloaded some kind of virus, but the reboots started on day 1, even before i downloaded anything to it. and then one day the flash button on the camera disappeared. i dont know what happened to it, i cant turn it on, so when i need to take pictures with no light i have to use snapchat. this is really annoying. lesson learned: dont buy a smartphone for less than $600 (like the samsung galaxy and the iphone). unfortunately the cheaper options don't work apparently .   by far the best android phone i have used out of 5 others. not sure of the hardware had been revised since release but the camera is perfect in my opinion. includes ois for clearer pictures. the size is perfect to me and many people have remarked that it makes sense to have a 6" (5.96) display. great for reading and enjoying video and games. great battery life even under heavy use .   i purchased this cellphone and it was defected, i contacted motorola, and they asked me to send it back. now they are refusing to pay the customs and receive it .   i'ts not as fast as i expected for a considerably expensive phone, and the size .   i knew it would be big, but everyone around thinks i'm using a tablet and they're surprised when i tell then is a phone .   good nevertheless .   the n5 was a hard act to follow and aside from the huge display and its incredible blackness, the n6 is a step down. the biggest annoyances are the curved back that makes it very position sensitive for wireless charging, the lack of a notification led and the ridiculous oled notification screen that doesn't behave consistently regardless of settings. other than that, i don't notice a problem with battery life; i adopted wireless charging when i got my n5 and i haven't worried about battery since, i just have qi pads on my desks, nightstand and my car console, just set the phone down and it gets fed. no more tethered tamagotchi-like worrying. more about the notification screen: really? lights up the room at night when it decides to go on, then it stays on at random if it is charging. rumor has it that there is a good old-fashion 3 color led hiding behind the top speaker port and it can be activated after the phone is rooted. i operate on call and having custom ring, vibrate and led notification colors is the difference between glancing in the direction of the phone and seeing the notification color and going back to sleep if it isn't important and with the n6 having to roll over, grab the phone, push buttons, interact with the screen and be fully wakened by the glaring. lame. more on the screen: ooooh, so big and pretty .   good nexus .   really want to like this phone. after upgrading to android 6.0, the phone has become slightly lagged. battery life is incredible, consistently going 30+ hours between charges. amoled screen is great for its size, wish it weren't so wide though. the phone is without a doubt, a two-hander. at this price point, it's a great buy .   awesome. love it. great value. i love it! new item in original box, all perfect .   good. very nice screen and functionality. i bought this phone because my cell carrier was slowing my other phone's hotspot speed that i used to download media to my nexus 7, seven inch tablet. this phone is only one inch smaller than my tablet, and now i can download media straight to my phone using my unlimited data with my carrier. being that my new nexus 6 is more like a mini tablet than a big phone, the media experience is just as good as using my small tablet. plus the screen on the phone has better resolution than the tablet. only issue i have is that the battery does not last like it does one my oneplus one phone. my oneplus would last all day on a charge, but i have to recharge the nexus 6 at least one or more times per day. the saving grace is that the phone has quick charging capability and charges fairly quickly using the supplied quick charger .   got mine and it was us version. was able to hook up with project fi with no issues. works great so far .   good. love this phone! i feel like it's an appropriate upgrade and a great as a first time phablet if you previously used a nexus 5 like i have. much more powerful, crispy screen and improved hardware. people who are saying this is a large phone. it is. but i also believe people are overreacting. yes it's big, but if you're looking at this phone in the first place you aren't concerned about that, it's an overall great android experience. i also get lots of complements on this phone too, mostly from apple and samsung users! highly recommend .   love it! really fast. it was ok. the camera didn't meet my expectations. the rest of the phone is very fluid and the screen is brilliant .   got this phone after my previous phone was stolen, was going to go for an iphone (haven't owned an iphone for 2 years) but came upon this one and being last years model the price was so low i couldn't pass on it. i'm happy i chose this phone, the pure android experience is completely superior to what samsung offers (i was tired of touchwiz, that's why i was going back to iphones). at this price it's hard to beat. all apps work great and fast, camera is good, and battery lasts longer than my previous phone (samsung note 3). one thing to consider is if you set up a pop account to the gmail app it will drain your battery twice as fast, sometimes faster. so i set gmail to inbox and set the pop account to cloudmagic .   excelent phone. the price doesn't reflect what this phone is capable of .   the product is too good, but problem is weight. its too much weighted .   this is a christmas present for my son. he picked it out. he was so excited. it is a beautiful phone .   very good phone but shipping to nigeria cost more than 12 thousand naira. great screen (but could be brighter), amazing front facing speakers, great call quality, battery on android 6.0 had been incredible, runs very fast. camera could be better but it's not that bad, i honestly generally prefer the pictures here to the lg g4 in auto the s6 has a better camera and the 6p i replaced this with is amazing if you want a great camera get the 6p. software runs great 6.0 is android refined and it just works. nfc is oddly placed and makes tap to pay awkward. no fingerprint sensor. selfie cam is absolutely terrible. get this if: you want great speakers smooth and reliable performance great battery (6.0 update) big screen respectable rear camera don't buy if: you want the best camera you take selfies it's too big are outside alot (screen is hard to see in direct sunlight) need the newest and best processor and fingerprint sensor buy a nexus 6p if: you want all of the positives from both categories above .   these are beautiful phones. comes clean with no carrier garbage apps preloaded. very nice .   as of this writing, i have owned this phone for about six weeks. though the model is over a year old, this phone is still plenty powerful. coming from using a galaxy s4 and an lg g2, i have come to appreciate the pure vanilla android os that is offered here. some of the gimmicks on the s4 and g2 are missing, like burst mode photos, double tap awake, and the ir blaster. however, the stability i get from this flavor of the os is worth the sacrifice (to me). of course, you may want more advanced features. that said, this is the reason that android is so awesome. because google opens their source code (android operating system) out to the public, vendors are able to tinker with it how they see fit. i was between this and paying almost double for the newer edition of the nexus line (the nexus 6p). huawei (who made the nexus 6p) is still a budding company (in my opinion). motorola has been around for ages, they make solid products, and the battery life of their android phones is far superior of most phones on the market today. if you are on the fence between buying this phone (at such a reasonable price for the specs you get), i say go for it. if my review helped you, please click the â€œyesâ€ button. click my name to check out my profile for my other product reviews and wish lists. feel free to send me an email through my profile if you have any questions or comments .   coming from a virgin mobile galaxy s3, i love this phone. haven't had much lag and it's been amazing for me. big plus for me is the quick charging and screen size. i got used to the screen size in 2 days. after that, my s3 just seems too small for me. the screen is great for reading. no issues for this phone running on 6.0 marshmallow with project fi! although i wanted the 6p, i really don't regret buying this phone. price was a steal for its size and performance! it's cheap if you really compare to every other contract/no contract smartphone .   only downside i have about this phone is that the camera doesn't focus in some areas .   huge phone. worked great and looked cooler. issues i had were with the os which is on google not the phone itself. worth getting big time now that it has android marshmallow which is a god of smooth running .   they get 5 stars for customer service, but the hardware gets 1 star. this is my 2nd nexus 6. motorola was kind enough to replace the 1st phone because there were a few glitches (power button froze at times and the screen didn't turn on when you needed it to). this was mainly a problem because i work on my phone alot. i need to be able to answer every call, but when the screen won't turn on that makes it difficult to answer all the calls. well, the replacement phone is even more flawed. while, it doesn't have the glitch with the power button, i have to constantly turn it off because my text messages aren't sending. this could be hardware, but my guess is that it is software. i get a message that says message wasn't sent, try again. i turn the phone off and try again, but nope messages won't send. i am not receiving some text messages at all. and i have proof because i am in a group text with my business partners and they have been complaining about me not responding to texts. not to mention, i keep getting a system download message even though i have installed the update 3x now, which i why i believe there may be a software issue. i would ask for a replacement phone but the nexus 6 is clearly flawed, so i will have to find a better phone. *sigh* my nexus 4 was so good to me .   why did i wait so long. this phone is awesome, huge, but awesome. big step up from my galaxy s5. camera was a step sideways or maybe down. but nexus gets you into project fi so this is a cheap way to get started. the screen is awesome, camera is ok, speed is phenomenal, and stock android is where it's at. i've had iphones, flip phones, samsung smart phones and this. this is my favorite. i may skip the nexus 6p .   nice phone ,so i update to android newest version, so it maks good experence .   fone is smooth, never hangs. battery life is not up to the mark .   the black siding on the case is starting to fall off. i've had the product 5 weeks and it is falling apart .   i've owned several of this model. it's a good phone, good camera, but the screen breaks way too easily. i've owned a few and i've never had a screen crack from drops so easily. my best friend and i have both owned several. i hope the newer models are more durable because this might be the least durable phone i've ever owned. only reason i kept going back to it was because it's one of the only phones on the verizon network that is easy to unlock and root .   awesome. super great phone for this money .   coming off a samsung galaxy note edge and all i can say is wow. this phone is super fast and free of all bloatware best of all you get the latest android software updates as soon as they come out .   got error when trying to inãÿtall ota 5.1.1 from 5.1 build lmy47d, i installed marshmallow and am liking it .   there is a google nexus help discussion, called "nexus 6 data connection failure - cross carrier, location and os version", which details a huge problem with these phones. search for it on google - i don't think i can link to external sites here. they cannot keep lte data signals. in fact, sometimes i go from lte to no data at all in my own house - i just can't connect to my t-mobile network. it's a huge known issue, and google has done nothing to fix it - it's been known since may. avoid. i love it .   this is my first great android cellphone .   after charging the nexus 6 with 5.0, powered the unit without the sim card. setup gmail account and home wifi then upgraded to the current 6.0. after all updates were done, powered off to insert the sim card. the nexus 6 is working great .   bought it for google fi. works great .   very good phone, took a bit to get it to update to marshmallow but after i got it, phones been good. battery life is ok, coming from a droid maxx it definitely goes through battery much quicker, but understandable. my only real complain is how low down the lock button is on the phone, and how close the volume buttons are to it .   good phone. very very pleased .   the good: supersized display android lollipop better 13mp camera qi + turbo charging the bad: way too big for some no active display pricier than nexus 5 redundant messenger app the verdict: nexus 6 proves that google's nexus program is not only far from dead, it's alive and kicking with a powerful 6-inch phablet that runs its latest android software. i recommend this phone for someone that want great phone but want a pure stock android experience .   yes no glass screen protector can cover the entire screen since its curved. yet this goes on easy with no dust or bubbles. this has saved my phone once so far. i am waiting for the crack to get worse before replacing. some people don't understand these are sacrificial screen protectors and that the glass must be weaker than the screen. if it was stronger it would just transfer the shock through the glass in to the screen .   good price .   legit imei. brand new u.s. carrier compatible. put a t-mobile sim card and it works like a charm. fast shipping .   don't used any other brand android phone beside nexus .   other android phone such as samsung, lg, and so forth got a lot of junk software that degraded the phone performance and battery life .   excellent phone great sound. the system of this cellphone is a little lag and the battery is very hot. basically, you should in-charge the phone twice or even more every day .   unlocked carrier, not unlocked rooted .   i purchased this nexus 6 to use in google project fi, it was a bargain. it is yet to be activated, i have had weeks of aggravation waiting for google to activate the phone, but good news! google has found out that this new unlocked nexus 6 is attached to tracfone, not unlocked and now i'm wondering if it's actually new. i'm shocked that this has happened, google and i have wasted lots of time on this nexus 6. what's going on amazon .   amazing phone for the price does everything you wanted to do the screen resolution is amazing photos look great this phone is a beast .   excellent phone this is my second phone. i have gifted to my son .   as advertised .   i loved the phone since i got my hands on it. it feels premium, durable, grippy in my hands. the marshmallow runs just buttery smooth and i don't notice any significant frame drop or lag when operating the phone. the reason why i gave it 4 stars though is because of the speakers issue i'm encountering lately. when i play any music out of the front speakers it gradually drops down . i have no idea whether it has something to do with the software or hardware. this problem really pisses me off. i wish it'd a software issue. but i made some research on the web and there are many users having this problem and they say it is a hardware issue. other than that this phone is a beast and recommended for android fans who wants a budget friendly handset. finally, i want a response to my feedback by amazon to solve the problem i'm facing at the moment .   big, fast & good battery life. as with any nexus it has no sd slot :-(. phone is great. quite a bit bigger than what i was used to with the samsung galaxy s5. i thought it was a great deal and phone arrived quickly .   good build quality; like the screen resolution .   though not a motorola fan, had a pretty bad experience with motorazor long long time back (around 12 - 13 years back) since then never used motorola again, but this as my backup phone has helped to improve motorola's image for me at least .   there are friends who are big time fans of motorola but somehow it failed to catch any fancy for me .   hope using this for a long time will be good .   wonderful machine .   great hardware, battery life not so great though .   excelent phone  .   great phone but the phones speaker for talk stopped working so one star. great screen and touch system, always updated to the last version of android.great processor also. the downside, no option to add external memory or to change battery. the display is huge if you are used to smaller phones, but when you get use to it, its fantastinc .   big .   freaking .   screen - what else do you need to know .   seriously .   it's a great price and it does everything you can think of quickly and without drama, i, however don't play games on my phone so i can't comment on that aspect but using it as a tool, and not a toy is awesome. what i don't like is that it's almost too big - it fits great in my back pocket but god help you if you sit on it but really, you won't forget it's there. it's big but not an irritant and it's well balanced in my hand, the back is a little slippery so keep that in mind. some have commented on the camera but to me it's great. i'm actually using it more than my nexus 7 for everyday browsing and emails .   it's that good. buy one now - especially since you can find them cheap (also, do yourself a favour and buy a case asap). this is the most unique phone you can buy for under 400 dollars. it has both cdma and gsm receivers in it so no issue taking it to all 4 carriers. you are in for a treat if you are a into google products. with google launching project fi. the android os on this phone is very light compared to samsung touch wiz. no bloat. the quality is top of the line no need for a case unless you need one for other reasons. sound on this phone is these out of every phone i ever owned .   i receive the new nexus today. it looks good, but once i click the screen for action, the upper speaker generate a cracking. this noise is quite easy to notice, i can clearly hear it in the quite room. i am thinking return it .   i'm just glad i received the us version after reading a review that said they received the international one .   google doesn't provide updates for nexus devices that are not sold by google store. this is intolerable, i bought nexus phone for timely updated. and i don't want to flash my phone with pain of reconfigure. this is not true nexus phone. still waiting for update. however no clue on who provides update for my phone. bad experience google not a great support .   very pleased! i have a family of five and choose not to get upgrades through att in order to save money. this means that we have to buy phones outright. i bought two nexus 6 phones to try out and they have been as good or better than our any of our iphones in the past. we are still trying to figure out the music storage and ring tone capabilities, but haven't spent much time on doing this. if these turn out to work as well as everything else then this phone is unbeatable, especially for the price. future christmas gifts .  i think so .   perfect except the back is already coming up. excellent device .   great phone! love the camera quality and the battery life .   as a loyal longtime nexus 5 user, i decided to remain in the nexus family despite suffering from serious battery issues in nexus 5. nexus 6 is a purchase i am delighted with so far. processing speed is fantastic, user interface is seamless and the design is a perfect phablet. brilliant to use kindle reader app and watch stuff on netflix. speaker is good as well. i really like this phone .   this phone is awesome! i wasn't sure if i would like the size and at first it took a bit getting used to. now i can't imagine using a smaller phone! the phone is very fast and smooth as well. the screen looks amazing and the battery life is better than i expected. the turbo charging is very cool. i just charged from 34% to 100% in about 40 minutes! i suggest a nice bumper or tpu case for it though. (i bought the encase flexishield case (frosted white) from mobilefun.com). it is essentially clear and really shows off the beauty of the white nexus 6. i'm on google's project fi and really like that as well. this phone is a great deal for $400 for the 64gb version (i highly recommend the 64gb as the storage is not upgradeable) .   spins and spins. doesn't lay flat, so don't expect to do any gesture typing while it sits on your desk. otherwise, this is a great phone. i'm using it with google fi service .   what an amazing phone. i had the nexus 4 for two and a half years before it slowed down at all. google products are the way to go! my phone is easy to use, beautiful display, good call quality .   absolutely fabulous. now has the marshmallow update. great hardware too .   after the $300 price reduction, the nexus 6 became a deal impossible to refuse. after my asus zenfone 2 stopped identifying touch input without having been dropped a single time spanning months, i was absolutely heart broken, forced to give up the intel based phone @ 5.5" i had grown extremely fond of. the nexus 6, through and through, however, is a better device across the board. brighter screen, higher pixel density, more slender dimensions, much much better sound, improved photographic clarity. at this cost, the device is unmatched .   it's really 4.5 stars. not perfect but a very good phone. great for large hands. above average call quality. very good hd quality screen. above average photo and video. above average battery life for a screen this large. lots of available accessories. no added bloatware, just a pure android experience. cannot add an sd card. very happy with this purchase .   going from a galaxy s3 to this was just ridiculous. at first, turning on the screen felt like i was sitting at an imax theater. screen looks just incredible. feels great in my hand. battery lasts multiple days of heavy use, usually, and quick charge really lives up to its name even if the battery didn't last quite long. there is no substitute for the pure android experience of nexus phones. most manufacturer's insist on cramming the os full of their own crap no one needs or even wants - stock 5.1.1 (which this will upgrade to very shortly after you're using it) is snappy and fantastic. there is nothing any other phone has that i can see myself wanting. if you're ok with the enormous display size, this device will not disappoint .   extremely happy with my purchase. i upgraded from a galaxy 3. i'm connected through project fi. this is a monster phone, especially at this price .   no regrets after two months with this phone, especially at the previous sale price. good voice clarity and a great screen. i typically get at least a day of battery use but the included turbo power charger is amazingly fast when i do need it. the phone has worked great on t-mobile but i've just switched to google fi, which was my primary reason for replacing my previous phone with the nexus .   i love it. i love the premium feel of this phone .   works like a charm and sometimes lasts couple days .   after nexus one, nexus s and droid maxx (also known as motorola xt1080m), i chose nexus 6 as my 4th android smart phone, of course it didn't make me disappointed .   this phone is amazing. i returned the lg nexus 5x to opt to last years google flagship and i am not disappointed. i truly believe this is the best smartphone out for the price .   very pleased indeed .   this phone is great. super crisp display, great camera and very nice design .   i love it! could ask for a better phone  .   good one .   good solid phone, definitely priced just right a real bargain. highly recommended .   this is a very good pphone!phone. the battery runs out very quick. it came on time and no scratches or dents with the phone. a great buy. loving pure android .   great .   fast, i loved it .   fantastic phone! love it and can't wait to switch to google service as soon as it is available in my town! love this so much more and my iphone and my samsung galaxy .   awesome phone .   works great with metropcs ! a top of the line phone with unlimited 4g lte  .   can't beat it. excellent! highly recommended .   my first nexus phone. and i like it. thank you .   arrived before the expected time and works perfectly .   i have had this phone for about a month now. i absolutely love it. the screen is so large and clear, and the device so capable, that it has actually replaced my home computer for most general internet browsing tasks. i got the 64gb version, and i am very glad that i did; i generally do not tote around too much media, but if i find a good wifi connection sometimes i do download large amounts of data, or otherwise use the device as temporary storage for large files. also, the lack of an sd card slot makes the larger storage capacity that much more important to me. i have had many bad experiences with phone microsd cards corrupting and losing data, though, so i actually do not miss it that much. some suggestions to make your phone ever better: - get a microusb -> full size usb adapter, they are available here on amazon for dirt cheap, and let you plug in devices with full sized usb ports. this means that, among other things, you can plug in regular full size usb drives. i have used this in the past without issue; on this phone, i had to install the nexus media importer app to enable this functionality. not a big deal. - generally, i find it easiest to copy files to/from the device by using a combination of the es file manager app on the phone to create a ftp file server using the app's remote manager function, then on your computer (connected to the same wifi network) i used lftp on the command line to mirror the entire directory structure of the device's "sdcard" directory, where most all of the user-data and media is contained, right to my pc. this works great in both linux and on os x (install it with homebrew package manager). it works even better if your computer has an ethernet connection which it can broadcast and share over its own wifi network; this function is built into os x under the share settings. this way, i get transfer speeds comparable with usb 2.0. the advantage to this, especially on the mac, is that i do not have to deal with the horrible android transfer software which is buggy and glitches out and drops connections a lot. - look into project fi for a cell carrier. it seems to be a good deal. i got an invite (non-transferable) but have not switched yet since i don't yet want to give up my verizon coverage. but this is one of the few devices supported by it, so that can be appealing if you want it. - it can get android version 6.0 if you want. mine came with 5.1 installed out of the box and later on verizon got the ota update for 6.0 beyond all that, i do not think there is too much else that you wouldn't find on a standard android device. the camera is decent in bright settings, though really bad at night; don't plan on taking landscape shots of the city lights at midnight with this one. overall, a very capable phone, and while its already a generation old, i don't see why it shouldn't last for a year or two, or more, as is the typical expected lifespan for android devices .   great price for a great alphabet. fast and responsive. battery could be better .   huge screen and it's durable .   good .   awesome phone, even when it has a really large screen it fits well in pant's pocket, so all good for me .   nexus doesn't have the gimmick functions like my previous samsung galaxy note 3. but its a practical phone with high tech spec for its price. only downside i came across the phone its with the t-mobile service, voices breaks in and out like bad reception. i have to rely on wi-fi calling for a clearer reception. i have perfect hearing, and sometimes i have trouble hearing through the speaker part of the phone if i don't place my ear directly at the right spot. and the phone supposedly has this ergonomic curve on the back side, but i find it hard to text while placing it on the table. it will spin or wobble as you press against it .   great phone, it's better than sony z3. the phone is not that much better than my n5. it is however, bigger. n5 has been updated to 6.0 for a month now. still waiting on the update on the n6. 11/10/15. best mobile i've ever owned - and i've been through a few. it is a little big, and takes some getting used to, but after a week or so, one-handed operation is still easily achieved .   a very solid and well built nexus phone by motorola and google. running the latest version of android 6.0 (marshmallow) and it runs like a dream. extremely quick, great battery life, and a gorgeous amoled screen that is 5.96 inches. speaker quality is loud, but does not distort. call quality is both crisp and clear with great signal strength. the snapdragon 805 processor is a beast, and can run apps very quickly. even with the new nexus 6p out, i feel there is no reason to upgrade .   i truly love my purchase. there was a bit of frustration between whether i received to international or us version. i wish there were programming and a manual with instructions (booklet) that would have been included. the only down side that is a little bothersome, is that there is not an option to expand memory, by use of a sd card. overall, this is one that i strongly recommend and would purchase again .   i just bought this one 28 days ago. today i realized that i have dead pixels. that pixel is always red and never changes its color. its so small but im afraid that it may increase and capture the entire screen or getting bigger dy bay day. im so sad about it. i really really liked this phone and i almost got used. im sending it back today .   if you like big phones this is the one. awesome screen definition, great stereo sound with two front speakers, great performance even when updated to marshmallow .   really good and worth it .   it's great for the price. definitely recommend .   i love everything about this phone .   i got this phone only to find out that the camera was not working, each time i try to use it, it keep showing ''can't connect to camera'' .  , i have since returned it about 2 weeks ago, and amazon have not contacted me about my refund, i was very disappointed, .  , i lost money and i lost phone, my dream phone ended up being my worst nightmare .  , i just hope i still get back my refund anytime soon .   this $400 phone was great until it barely tapped the ground and shattered. like, it literally .   tapped the ground and the whole screen shattered. i would understand if it was a bad fall, but it wasn't. seems like an expensive phone would have better glass. should have got a galaxy. highly disappointed. :(. it's been a week and i really am enjoying my nexus 6. it takes great photos and they look great on the 6 inch 2k screen! apps open and operate quickly with the fast cpu and ample memory. android updated to 5.1.1 and google has said the nexus 6 will get version 6 (marshmallow) but no date yet. the nexus 6 operates on lte band 12 so i will get the benefits of 700mhz performance as t-mobile upgrades the sf bay area! (really looking forward to the better range and building penetration provided by band 12.) it is big, coming from a 4.7 inch lumia and just fits in a rugged qx xx-large nxt heavy duty case with the ringke fusion scratch resistant clear back drop protection bumper case installed. i also installed a trushield tempered glass screen protector. my first glass screen protector and i will never use film again! only negative is the lack of a micro-sd card slot for additional song storage. (i have over 100 gb.) battery performance could be better given the phone's size. i have not timed it, but less than 12 hours with bluetooth and wi-fi enabled .   nice super fast phone .   it is an extremely good deal at $350 .   super sweet phone. but, it is frigging huge. does not fit well in any pants pocket .   quality build, prompt delivery and well packaged. large phones are not for everyone, but i had a sprint samsung galaxy note 3 so the switch-over has been pretty easy. i bought a ringke case because it has a small loop to connect a lanyard . i added a pleson screen protector for added security (i hope.) i bought it to use with google's project fi. the nexus 6 motorola is one of three phones that will work with project fi. with newer versions out, this discounted phone was within my budget. it seems to be well built i only had it for a day when google updated to android 6. samsung took a leisurely 5 months to update to android 5. customer support is without peer! imagine talking to a human being within minutes of contacting them (they will call you back, too.) fyi, project fi has the same great customer service. the camera works well, and with camera fv-5, takes raw images- a big selling feature for me. why not 5 stars? i haven't had it long enough to see how it well it handles being out in the world, i suspect it will be fine but who knows? i will update my rating as it is warranted. so far, very happy camper .   excellent phone, definitely a great time to buy it, 64gb is more than enough for me. screen has some yellow tints when it should be plain white, but i think that's a known issue .   nice phone, well worth the money. highly recommend. fast, clear resolution, strong battery. what more could you ask for .   so far has been the best android i've owned to date. at first the size seems overwhelming but you get uses to itbvwry quick. once you do it seems impossible to go back to using anything less in size. the front facing speakers are awesome. those alone make the phone top notch, and that's not even getting into how responsive and quick the device is. well worth the money glad i waited for them to drop in price .   just one thing making me recall of nexus 5,which covered by unslippery cover with good handfeel,but for this nexus 6,the back cover and whole shape is a bit bizzare,which keeps rotating while putting it on the table and keep slippery while holding in hand,not an ideal design from safety perspective .   this is a great phone for half the price verizon is selling it for (as of october 2015). it is pure google android lollipop 5.0 - mine just updated this week to marshmallow 6.0 - with no verizon or samsung bloatware. you can get the verizon apps you need at the playstore. it scared me a little getting it activated, it takes some time for everything to "sync up" i guess. following the instructions on the verizon site everything went perfect except getting the verizon cloud backup of my contacts to download was very slow and awkward. the cloud app menus are not the best. but after an hour or so - as i recall - all was well. the next day the phone was perfect but then the following evening suddenly all my contacts were gone! i went to the vz site on my pc and looked in my cloud drive. i found all of my contacts in the trash can! bizarre. i undeleted them and started "backup" - the wrong word in my opinion - and they were restored to my phone again. since then, about three weeks the phone has been flawless. no stars deducted for what i assume was a verizon issue. great battery life, superior to s5. great, large display and no cheap easy to chip plastic chrome around the glass like on the samsungs. if the description says model 00636nartl it is fully verizon 4g-lte compatible. verizon will give you a nano sim card for free at a company store or mail it to you if you request one online. i used the chat feature and the rep knew exactly what i needed and had no problem at all with this not being an "official" verizon phone. we are apparently in a new era where verizon is cutting rates and becoming more customer friendly. finally .   battery problem returned the product. this is a great phone, and for $350, it is highly worth the cost. the screen is a bright 6 inch high resolution 1440p screen. the speakers are dual front firing speakers, which are great for watching movies and listening to some music, a much needed upgrade from my old samsung galaxy s4's single rear firing speaker. since this phone is a nexus, this phone always gets the latest versions of android in a timely fashion straight from google. overall, this phone is fast. i would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great phone and is on a budget .   personally i like the larger "phablet" sizing. the screen is very sharp, the performance of android "marshmallow" on this phone is very snappy, and the battery seems to last an above average amount of time and also charges quickly with the included 15 watt charger. i'm using google fi service, so i know i'll be saving a few bucks over time. if you like the android os and the size of this phone (it will not fit into my pants pockets), you will like this phone. my wife, for example, will never use this phone because she prefers apple's ios .   i always like to use a mobile phone with best specs and performance and, google nexus 6 fullfils all that requirement .   shipped quickly and exactly as described. worked on verizon wireless .   i am enjoying this phone immensely. so much better than my old apple 4 iphone. it's almost like having a mini-ipad within your reach .   really nice phone, fast processor, crystal clear screen. it is large to hold as a phone, but i'm ok with it. i found it useful to hang it on my belt when i'm working or sitting, and slip it into my pocket when i'm walking .   great phone! works perfect. in my opinion the best product for this price .   a fully capable phone. i like the idea of prompt android updates. the phone is bigger than i thought it would be .   that's not terrible but i probably would have been happier with a screen that was just a bit smaller so it would be easier to get it into my pocket .   nice 6 inch screen. i wish the hardware was the same size as the samsung galaxy mega though. it also needs an external microsd card slot. enclosed battery (not sure how to change it out when it goes bad one day.) other than that its a really nice phone. its a "google iphone" basically .   as expected. i need charge it everyday, but i like moto. as soon as i opened the sealed box and saw this huge phone i fell in love with it! i could not ask for a better phone. it is a very very beautiful device which as completely replaced my samsung tablet for good! i highly recommend this device .   stop looking for a phone this is the best phone for android .   awesome phone. make sure u purchased the us version model item 00632nartl  .   phone was unresponsive. i love it battery life is good i love the larger screen. i was concerned before i got it was going to be too big to fit in my pocket but it fits find the tapered edges on the phone make it seem not nearly as big as it is in your pocket. the only problem i had was the stock charger that came with the phone this is super fast boost charger and overheated the phone while charging. so i have stopped using the stock charger and use my old charger haven't had any problems since .   love this phone! size is just right. screen is perfect size. pictures are brilliant. best phone purchase ever .   awesome phone. best value of any phone on the market plus it gets the latest android versions months ahead of the rest. i just got marshmallow last week. love it .   wow is this a crazy good phone, especially for those who live in rural areas. while other reviews have covered the other excellent specs of this phone, i want to just say what a big deal it is i'm even able to write this review from my phone. with the past two phones i owned, i got edge at my house in rural missouri with t-mobile. now, with the extended lte technology this phone supports, i'm able to get 4g lte and the difference is night and day. while extended lte isn't as fast as the lte i get in urban areas, it's still broadband. (i'm getting 1.5mbps) which is a huge deal for me. not only does this phone support the newest cell protocols, but it also has an incredible antenna. there used to be a special spot in my house where i got reception (2 bars of edge xd) with my previous two smartphones, but now i am getting lte throughout my entire house. it just blows my mind. with the price dropping because of google's newer nexus 5x and nexus 6p i couldn't be happier with the price for performance .   best deal on any phone out there. this phone is terrific! amazing battery life on marshmallow .   or whatever was left of it after an unsuccessful attempt at removing it from what i guess. other than that small annoyance, it is great! especially after using the same smartphone for more than 3 years. great phone. i am so disappointed with all the audio issue it comes along, and it was performing way slower than i was expected .   perfect size for my hands and aging eyes. only minor annoyance so far is the power button is right in the middle of the phone, so when i pick it up on the go, i occasionally hold the power button too long, rebooting the phone. would have liked to pick up the moto-care protection plan, however motorola only offers it if you purchase the phone through their website. bummer. get with it, moto .   works perfectly fine, it's my first nexus and i'm loving it! the only thing i could complaint about is the fact that it didn't come with earphones, besides that, it's a great buy .   fantastic device that worked just as expected. clean stock install done on it with marshmallow and it flies! i bought a 6p but returned it because this phone suits my needs and is $200 cheaper .   beautiful phone. i was very satisfied. the phone is simply awesome .   the size is good if you are like me who is into big devices. the screen resolution and camera are really good and i have to say that android marshmallow is really smooth and so far it has supprised me with a couple new features. 100% recommended .   great phone. came from note 3 and this one is even bigger. pretty much has to be a 2 handed phone. i'm ok with that though. if it had a microsd slot it would have been 5 stars for me. with 6.0 update battery is great. works great with project fi .   the phone is great and i had no problem with the transaction .   good phone. works well. i ordered this phone not long ago i never was much into motorola but i decided to give this a try. it was actually recommended to me and since my previous 2 phone died on me. i wanted to give motorola a try. so far its been running and performing way better than my galaxy s4 and my lg g2 which both of those phones gave out on me and they were fairly new as well. im not too happy about the camera though my lg g2 took photos with much better resolution and in dark areas as well. the camera on this phone takes pictures too dark but thats not really an issue for me. i rate it 5 stars for its speed and performance. delivery was fast as well. actually arrived before the expected date. thanks amazon .   a great phone and an insanely speedy delivery i got it 2 days after i ordered it i recommend it to everyone :). the phone is beautiful, blazing fast and stunning overall .   i am so impressed with this device. at first holding it the size is is large. but after using it it just fits. the screen real estate is luxurious. it has great camera and battery life that lasts all day. after receiving the phone it updated to 6.0. i love having qi charging. i am using project fi as it one of 3 phones that can. i don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this phone. it is a bargain currently on amazon .   wao! this is the best phone i've gotten so far. i've an iphone user for some time now, but needed an android phone for the google services at my work and well i gave it a try and it's been quite smooth. only have used it for 1 day but it's extremely easy to use. only issue is that it get a little hot when using it over more than 10 minutes straight but is not discomforting. give 5 stars as the design fits all my needs and i got android m upgrade right away .   great phone. size too big. the nexus 6 performs great, but the yellow tint on the screen is horrible. maybe i just got one from a bad batch. for a last-generation phone, it still feels like a new phone. everything is smooth and quick, battery life lasts more than a day with moderate use and several hours or more of heavy wifi tethering. it is a large phone though, i struggle to operate it with a single hand .   i returned the product. it came in bad condition. phone was dirty and had a couple of scratches .   this is my first nexus device and i love it. i received the 6.0 update quickly and this improved battery life. the device is responsive (at least with my nova launcher settings i have no issues) and the 32 gb of memory are more than enough for my spotify music and the apps i use. some games such as hearthstone might lag at times (not sure if this was a thing of the past before i played a few matches or if it's the game/resolution that is too demanding). the camera takes some amazing pictures (if you set it at 13 mp with the 3:4 aspect ratio). the camera software will also improve according to google so the quality might improve in time as well. i have not tried making any videos, but i know it can record 4k@30fps. while i was uncertain if the size will be too much for me, i can say that within a few days i got used to the big screen, and in a few weeks any discomfort completely disappeared (i do have big hands and i don't mind using the device with 2 hands for the most part). the amoled screen is great for watching youtube videos and maybe some netflix while the stereo frontal speakers do a nice job with the sound as well .   this phone is awesome. all of my smart phones (in the past) have been iphones. i have been happy with them and apple (but not at&t) so after looking i decided to try google fi. i could have bought a phone from them, but amazon offered a $100 better deal. i could spend the same amount and get a better phone (which i did) or get the same for $100 less. having said that .   the phone is great, the screen size is great (i'm a little older and the extra real estate is great for these eyes). in addition the features are excellent (never really used suri) so i'm not sure there is a replacement for that, but everything else seems to be nearly the equivalent of the iphone. it takes a little more plodding (since this is my first android) and i had to google some of the workings/settings. i will not need to do that in the future. the iphone is better set up for the beginner, but if you have been around a while, you can make your way through this with a little patience and common sense. google fi sent me a programed sim. you have on a wi-fi network to activate it. but everything worked fine. my bill is now $30 dollars (ish) as opposed to $90. 50 or 60 dollars a month adds up real quick .   fantastic phone, excellent condition, very much recommended .   *****. fantastic phone, qi wireless charging is great, screen is fantastic, with android 6 the phone is the most current you can buy .  only missing: laser focus on camera, 64bit cpu, fingerprint sensor. none will be needed in 2016, so save your money and rock the nexus 6 .   good phone! love the size even though it's very thin.most definatly need a case to protect it in case it falls. the size is very over rated.i have average hands and it seem small to me. highly suggest getting a good protectiv case like mako heavy duty case .   very clear bright picture and grafics .  easy to read for my i should be wearing my readers eyes. i am new to the android platform, but i am really enjoying getting to know it .   great. would have gave it 5 stars but i didn't receive any kind of manual for this phone .   i wanted this phone when it first come out but the price was pretty high. i got a moto x 2nd gen.had it for just 6 months then i dropped it. cracked glass. checked amazon for a replacement then saw the nexus 6 had knocked off 300.00. bought it,got it in 5 days, waited at verizon for 45 minutes for a tech. they took the sim out of my moto x and popped it in. everything working in 10 minutes. i'm one happy customer .   it's big and full of power. easy phone that doubles as a tablet. awesome product .   i dropped my ipad and shattered the screen. meanwhile my iphone 4 was getting long in the tooth. i decided to get a big phone and try to live with one device. two months in i'm saying it was a genius move. big in the pocket sure, but big when it comes to web surfing, email, buying stuff on amazon, etc. super great as a gps unit when i travel. holy cow! love, love, love this device .   this is the best phone i have ever had. its rooted with custom rom and its awesome, the reception is great batt life is great and screen is great. i would highly recommend this phone to everyone .   my wife is very happy with this new phone .   it is good phone - although did not realize how big it is till i got it. the camera could do with an upgrade. it is big and so i love it. the battery is also strong, which can last a full day under normal usage .   great phone, photography is fantastic and super easy to use. however battery life could be better .   good. after coming to the nexus 6 from the lg optimus l90, i feel like i've come back into the cutting edge for phone devices. the screen is simply stunning, and the performance is what you would expect from a flagship phone, but with amazon's current price point, it's a no-brainer. i have experience only one moment of slow-down, and that was when i was running a ridiculous number of apps. everything is buttery-smooth in operating the device. great camera, especially considering the wasteland from which i was coming from. i have not tested the latest operating system, marshmellow, yet, but the phone runs stock lollipop extremely well and i do not expect marshmellow to run poorly on this device given the specs that it boasts. the only real issue that i have had with this phone is the battery life, but if you aren't as heavy a phone user as i am (and you probably aren't--i have a problem), you will be able to get through a work day on a charge. the charger that motorola has provided also charges the phone extremely quickly, so if you just plug in the phone for 15-30 minutes, you'll be pretty much back up to 70-85% to get you back over the hump. you might want to wait for a 6p price drop or just get the 6p now, but this is really a stunning phone and if you want to save a few dollars, go ahead and order this incredible phone. it's the best phone i have ever owned .   quite a good phone generally, being native google means no manufacturer bloatware and you get updates the second google releases them. i'm using it on google fi and it's awesome .   nice phone, pretty fast compared to my earlier phone. ok. fast. beautiful screen, beautiful camera. size took a little bit of time to get used to but now everything smaller feels inferior. if you wear tight pants with small pockets it straight up doesn't fit, but there are plenty of alternative options to putting your phone in your pocket. i would absolutely make this purchase again if given the choice, great use of my money .   i love it. it is an excellent phone. beyond my expectations .   pretty good. great phone all around .   i received my first phone last friday, set it up with att and proceeded to explore my new phone and that's when i discovered that every time i hit contacts it would flash and not open. i reset the phone and still the same issue so i called tech support. we tried a few more things and it was determined that it was a hardware issue and that i should talk to motorola. they also advised me that he did not know if it was under warranty because i bought it from amazon. he transfer me and before i could talk to the tech we were cut off. i decided to call amazon and before i could finish my story they had a new phone on it's way and a return slip for the faulty one. i received my new phone on sunday. kudos to amazon for the awesome customer service. this is one of the reasons i am a loyal customer. for point of reference i went from an iphone 4s to a fire phone and now to the nexus 6. i love this phone and have already ordered a second one for my husband. it's fast, easy to use, the screen is beautiful and i love the front facing speakers in fact there isn't much i don't like about it. the size is a little cumbersome but i think i will be able to get use to it. after reading a million reviews that said it was huge it was actually smaller than i thought it would be when i unboxed it. the one thing that i really dislike is where the on/off/volume buttons are. i have turned off the phone numerous times because it's where i tend to hold my phone. this is going to take some adjustment. the nexus 6 has won me over to android permanently. good bye apple! i am a little concerned about the warranty and whether the phone actually comes with a warranty. right now i'm a very happy nexus owner .   fantastic phone. the only issue i have with the phone is that the vibration is fairly loud compared to other phones that i have owned. on the plus side, the phone is very fast (just below the new 6p in specs) and is meant to run custom roms without issue. i can safely say that it is the best phone i have owned .   don't buy if your purpose is to get updates as soon as google releases them. this phone gets locked to at&t as soon as you slide an at&t sim. this means you won't get android updates from google but from at&t, which will arrive 6 months later . i bought it because i didn't want to wait for os updates, but this defeats the whole purpose .   great product, speedy delivery .   terrible quality .  plastic is chipping off and fallig all over my house. the phone works great and wow, what a beautiful display. it is big but didn't feel so big that it was awkward or difficult to use. i always carry my phone in my pocket and had no problems there. where the rating takes a hit is in the fact that the first phone i received went right back after discovering that the headphone jack wasn't working correctly and then after having and enjoying the replacement for about 2 weeks i noticed that the back cover was coming off! ughh! even after all that i still love the phone and decided to keep it. picked up a replacement back cover for $10. easier than having to go through the return process again .   totally satisfied .   this phone is awesome and for the price this is the best phone you can get. the screen and the build quality are really good. the shipping was also really fast .   very good item. great phone, great price .   fits nicely in my bear hands .   i've been using this phone for about 4 weeks and i have to write to say that i love this phone completely. it is big and i love the front facing stereo speakers. i have cell service from gosmart, which has limited range compared to at&t, but is much cheaper. i'm coming from a galaxy s4 and a oneplus one. this nexus 6 beats the s4 hands down, of course, and it is better than the oneplus one. i would buy this phone again .   i just picked this thing up recently for a really cheap price and it's honestly incredible. don't let the fact that it's a little over a year old deter you if you're considering picking this thing up. it's fast, lasts all day easily, has plug and play frequencies for most carriers, and is huge. people tend to complain that it's too big, but as someone with larger than average hands, i find it really comfortable and honestly? i could never go back to anything sub 5.5 in. again. a steal at the price its being offered at .   phone was great while it lasted. i bought this phone on 10/24/2015 and took my about a week getting it set up because of sim card issues (my fault). then on 09/30/2015 the battery was depleted and the phone died and would not charge anymore. i tried everything the support people told me to do and nothing worked. upon further review this happens pretty often when the battery is depleted. what kind of terrible design makes it so that your battery powered electronic device will stop working forever because it runs out of battery? i have spent hours with tech support and they took up hours of my time because they would not forward me to who i needed to speak to. yeah so, tl:dr this phone will try to kill itself permanently every time it runs out of battery. every day is russian roulette for this phone .   amazing phone. awesome display .   everything was ok. the seller send the phone very quickly. it's a very good phone and everything run ok. i recommend the product and the seller .   i love it but haven't got my update to 6.0. i am disappointed in the purchase. incredible phone, i never expected a phone not made by apple could achieve this level of quality. the display is gorgeous, very bright when needed, the phone is fast, smooth, the camera is muchos better than what i expected after reading some reviews. i am loving the wireless charging cappabilities built in, i think that i like android even more than ios .   other than a pretty fragile micro usb socet that for pent from day too the phone is pretty good. a steal for $350. still up to par with the 2 newer nexus devices .   excellent phone. i'm using it with project fi, which sometimes has issues autimatically connecting to working public wifi through my cable provider (xfinity) .   one of the best phone for $349. i love android phones and nexus gives the pure android experience. love this phone and got 64 gb model for a reasonable price. phone responds super quick, boots up past, with a very smooth user experience. recently got updated to android m (6.0 marshmallow) and have much control over app permissions. only downside for me is the front camera which is 2 mp where as some androids from 2014 are having better front camera .   well, my first nexus phone, enjoy the "pure" andriod, google software, andriod update, also the big warm screen. no complain on the plastic motorola. all in all, very good for me, hope it could serve me more than two years .   amazing phone. love this phone .   the size is just pleasing .   the nexus 6 is a great phone, but is not for everyone. first it is huge. this is a reason i wanted it, but can be very unwieldy for most. second it runs stock android 6.0 marshmallow. i enjoy the clean, simple design which google has created. many would rather have the feature rich skins which non-nexus devices ship with. other than these possible set backs, the nexus 6 is a great flagship device. it contains all of the top specs expected on a new phone. the build quality was quite premium and the amoled screen is a joy to use. since the price has been dropping recently, this is an exceptional buy. if you enjoy stock android and ridiculous screen size, this is the phone for you .   best case for this phone, great purchase .   bought this phone once i was out of contract with verizon. i purchased it specifically to use with google's project fi to get out of my pricey wireless contract. this is the 2014 model with an original mrsp of $600, but i got it for $350 one month before the 2015 nexus 6p came out. as reviewers have mentioned, this phone is not for everyone. it is big! but i've grown to like it. i'm large myself at 6'5'' so i have no issues with the size. the screen is beautiful. i can read kindle books without squinting at a small screen or without pulling out my ipad. the camera shoots beautiful pictures and i have used it to create videos that i shot in 4k. with a quick charge charger, it goes from 0 to 100% in less than 2 hours and the battery lasts for a long time. and as a nexus phones, you will always be first in line for android updates. if the size doesn't bother you, it is a great phone to have .   i've been a samsung user for years but got fed up with always having to replace the screen, motherboard and sometimes the entire phone. i recently purchased the nexus 6 and i love this device it is by far the best device,as far as phones go, i have ever owned .   do not purchase this phone from amazon. it ships with version lnx07m, the original build of androind 5.0. because it ships with a build that is so old, you can not update it over a conventional over the air update, meaning you won't be able to update this phone past 5.0. that means its not compatible with google fi. google fi won't work with phones less than 5.1. just fyi. super dissatisfied .   this is phone is really good. the camera cannot work recently, and it reports mistakes when i open it. i dislike it .   love my nexus 6! my husband bought one in august and then i had to have one. glad i waited a couple months because i purchase mine for $150 less .   i got the 64gb model  .   for 400 it represents exceptional value and performance. and unlike other phones ( one plus) i didnt have to be on some exclusive list to buy it. great deal great phone .   the phone heatup a lot and the battery life is really bad .   excelent. everything run smooth, great value in this price. i prefer select nexus 6 other than the new generation nexus model .   i am very happy with my phone .   disappointed with screen pattern. it is not lcd. looks poorly .   good. good phone for the price. use the phone for a month now. the 4g lte often lost connection. i'm not sure because of the phone or t-mobile. battery life is not impressive, however, the charging time is quite fast. beside that everything else is good. in conclusion, if you need a functional phone within your budget, you could give it a try .   best phone ive ever owned. love love love it. camera issues (could not connect to camera error). finally updated software and fixed that but battery life was very poor. returned. nexus 5x is overall better for the same price .   edit i was using straight talk service and they pushed an update to lollipop without telling us its an att special update that will lock you down to att without no mashmellow updates in sight. and now i am switching to project fi only to find that i don't even get any cell signal in my home while my girlfriends nexus 6 get full signal. why am i buying a nexus for locking into att bulls*** that i am not even using the company! i am so furious that google will even cooperate with att to push this update. original review the size is ginormous. my hand cramps a bit the first few weeks using the phone. now i am uses to a big phone, and happily it fits in my skinny jean. i wont go down any size smaller than 5.5inch screen. the evolution of smart phone is more and more evident of a necessity of daily life and its increasing the time you are interacting with them. a big screen really helps both the battery life and interaction experience. if you are not crazy about the finger print sensor, which i think it will become a necessity in coming years, but not now, yet. you should go for this cheaper phone. if you are taking a lot of indoor photos in dark environments and thinks finger print is a necessity now, like your bank signin supports it. go for nexus 6p. switching from iphone, i think the only android phone that can compare with iphone are the nexus. others are only worse systems with the manufacturer try to make it harder to use and slower to even no upgrades of the os .   this is a really good device, the only downside for me was the fact of not coming with android 6.0 and i'm still waiting for the ota update. besides that, i recommend it .   no regrets, great phone purchased at great price. however, hope product does not require warranty service cause motorola seemed to have horrible warranty repair service lately .   excellent product. works great .   i love it. nice phone. no carrier apps to kill performance and battery life. it is a huge phone, but that is what i wanted so i couldn't be happier with it .   what a phone! the size i want to view, read and play games with stunning clarity. plus the latest android marshmallow operating system and all for a great price now it has just been superseded. i love it .   comes with a developer preview build. won't update to the latest firmware unless flash it back to stock. once that done, pure android  .   it is big and at first overwhelming but after awhile you get use to the size while almost every other device seems tiny. i came from an htc one phone so my upgrade absolutely had to have the front facing speakers as well. the sound is good quality not as good as htc one in my opinion but nontheless better than rear or side speakers. display was a jump from my htc so i liked that. battery life is decent gets me about 8 hours of heavy usage and almost a full day with light usage. i did notice some few kinks such as the sound on heavy apps like mortal kombat x would come out as static also despite the snapdragon 805 processor it would lag a bit from time to time. this isn't a phone where you'd buy just for a camera also it takes decent pics but nowhere near iphones or galaxy's pics. overall great phone just not for camera work. having quite a blast so far with this phone. even though, it's quite big in size and some may find it a little challenging to fit into their pockets, but what it has to offer is beyond goodness. powerful snapdragon chip, a big and high definitive screen, very responsive as well. the only minus point is battery life. if you limit your usage to only phone calls, sending and receiving messages, then it will last at least 3 days without the need to recharge. but heavier use such as playing games, browsing the web will reduce the battery from max to zero in about 10 hours. however, with the help of the turbo charger, you will get another 5 to 10 hours back with only 15-30 minutes of charging. over all, i'm really satisfied with it .   buggy software, random rebooting, constantly dropping signal. going back to amazon .   absolutely love the phone. good specs + stock android =great phone .   excelente. great powerful mobile with a great value. after over a month of use, i'd i say that the nexus 9 is a solid option for anyone willing to try a big phone. i had a oneplus one before this and the only reason i switched w because of the lack of lte bands in the one. when i first got the phone, i was a little disappointed with the entire package. the software was glitchy,battery life was terrible, and the battery saving mode made the phone pretty much unusable because of how slow it got. since then, i manually installed android m on my phone and it has been great. the phone easily lasts me for a day or day and a half with amazing stand by times. the camera app launches pretty fast and pictures are awesome. i think it's a great buy .   huge .   google fi - caution! if you're buying this phone to use with google fi, it won't work with fi. it has the "wrong build number", according to the google helpdesk. i just spent an hour with them. they've sent me instructions for how to flash the phone to try to get it to work, but simultaneously don't recommend doing so. i'm going to attempt it, but there are no guarantees. there's nothing wrong with the phone i received, per se--it just doesn't work for the reason i bought it .   excellent deal .   good mobile. i bought this because i saw an amazing price sold by warehouse deals. no doubt, the phone is much better (faster, smoother and just snappier in general) with marshmallow, although i didn't get to use it much to gauge the battery life before i returned it. the 2 main reasons i returned it were the poor battery and its size. i found that it died within maybe 5 hours if i am using it heavily. perhaps i was expecting too much, but i couldn't really get through a day with just moderate use either. as for the size, i found it just a tad too unwieldly and i did not feel like it was held securely when i tried to use it with one hand. i definitely couldn't text comfortably with one hand and we can totally forget taking pics with one hand! and finally, the fact that it lacked a micro sd card slot wasn't a deal breaker since i got the 64gb version, but that is always nice to have. i have now since gotten a moto x pure (style). i definitely liked the amoled screen on the nexus 6 better, although i missed the moto features such as twist for camera when i had the 6. another feature that i liked on the nexus 6 was the wireless charging. all in all, the nexus 6 is quite a huge phablet. it is powerful enough and still has pretty decent specs compared to a lot of the phones that have just been released, and the price is falling quite a lot, so i wouldn't hesitate to get one if the reasons i mentioned above are not a big deal .   pros: great screen, long lasting battery, bloatware free, gets os updates before non-google devices, awesome speakers. cons: camera software is garbage, video recording limited to 30fps even at 1080p .   a+. after you get over the sheer size if this phone it quickly becomes the best phone you ever had. i was weary of the phone because of reports of screen burn in and size. after a few weeks and the cruizerlite case i can say this phone handles everything i can throw at it without a hiccup .   motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 64gb, cloud white (u.s. warranty) this was my dream phone, primarily due to it's big screen for watching videos and content. upon receiving it, i realized it's even better than i'd thought! furthermore, with vanilla android and fast, guaranteed updates, it's a phone i will continue to enjoy over time. at this price, this phone is a steal due to its powerful internal hardware and smooth software experience. keep in mind though that the camera isn't good for nighttime photography, but then which phone ever is .   absolutely in love with this phone. not only does it have a great price (obviously now is the time to get it, since 5x and 6p are right around the corner), but it has some of the best specs around. fast charge is a huge plus .   even though it is a year old, this is a solid phone. i have experienced no lag or performance impact and have been putting it through its paces. this flagship phone can easily compete with a note 5 and gs6 any day of the week, but for significantly less. this is a great phone, especially for the price. the only drawback may be the size. it is very hard to operate the nexus 6 with one hand, but i found it is very easy to hold and talking with the big form-factor is not an issue. as a kicker, buying this from amazon gets you a year of unlimited cloud storage .   excellent cell phone! i have been using it for few weeks now. i love the big screen (5.96 inches diagonally). i love the excellent deal - it used to be $500 but now it's $350. comparing to my previous cell phone (blu windows phone 16gig), it's very fast. i would buy again. i would recommend .   i thought i would get this phone because it looks premium and has good hardware specs, but the execution is flawed. do a google search and you'll see hundreds to thousands of posts about the top speaker problems and call quality issues on this phone. my phone started showing these symptoms just 30 days after i bought it .   should have bought an iphone 5s (last phone was nexus 4- this one is plagued with issues). and if anyone says i was sent a defective unit .   then apparently i paid full price for a defective unit and the situation has not been rectified .   so far (less than 24 hours) it works very well. (i will update this if/as sentiments change.) quick, responsive, hasn't gotten hung up once. but .   this thing is freakin huge, and heavy. if you get it, you must get a case. too big to hold bare reliably, even for someone with big hands. diztronic's ultra case has a video of a guy dropping his from 5+ feet onto concrete, so i've gone with that case. subcase was very solidly built, but a major pain (literally) to get on and off, and made it even bigger and more unwieldy. it's like talking on a tablet, and it will not fit into your car holder. the upside? with a rubbery-sided case, you may be able to rest it on your dash and windshield without need for a holder. so get a bluetooth headset you're really comfortable with, and it'll probably work out just fine. do i like it? yes, and for the money, you can't beat the features and performance. with 3gb of ram, it's got a lot more headroom than even the new 6p and 5x. the display looks great, speakers are surprisingly good for so small a device (but there again, a 2-piece case like the subcase will cover the speakers up, rendering that feature irrelevant.) but if i had to do it without giving cost as much weight, i'd go with the nexus 5x instead. some may size matters a lot, but there is such a thing as too big. size does matter, and 5x's 5.7" is more manageable than 6 .   bought it from the used/refurbished section, phone was in amazing condition! greatest buy i have made on a phone for a great price! thank you amazon .   best since samsung galaxy s 111 went out. after connecting with project fi useful and the battery has improved for some reason i am satisfied with this product i might just buy another one for backup. this phone is great, amazing performance, sound good. my perfect phone .   greatest cellphone ever. all the iphone hype is not worth the money having this choice .   my husband has almost 1 month using it and he is very happy with it. the speed, screen and sound are very good .   wonderful screen and smooth operation. the phone is great, but the battery does not last even half a day. after 40 days of use, half of the screen went blank and unresponsive, did the hard reset option and the problem was still there, called motorola (1 year warranty) but since amazon.com is not an authorized motorola dealer they denied to repair or replace my nexus 6, so i just lost $400.00 .   bought the nexus 6 to use with verizon. no problem at all with verizon. i called them and had them ship the nano sim card. once i had that and the phone, everything transferred over. this was over the phone with tech support and not in one of the verizon stores. phone has been great. it is big but thats kinda what you're going to get with a phablet .   really nice phone. got a good one after many years .   as someone who came over to the nexus 6 from the samsung galaxy s4 (and, prior to that, the galaxy s3), here are my initial impressions after having the phone for about a day: the size: this phone is big and heavy. i expected, and wanted, it to be big. however, i did not realize just how heavy it would be. a coworker has a galaxy note that is about the same size, but seems to weigh not even half of what this phone does. one problem i've come across with the big screen involves widgets. i used to have a 4x2 clock/temperature/weather/date widget through fancy widgets that i really liked, which fit perfectly centered on the galaxy s-series phones. however, on this phone it did not, and there was no option for a wider widget, so i ended up having to install beautiful widgets, which has a 5x2 widget that worked out (though bw skins are not as aesthetically pleasing and the widget additional features are not as customizable as fancy widgets). i bought the "supcase" frosted case to protect my phone, and it does add some bulk, but even without the case the phone still seems a little too chunky to be practical (even though i rarely use it to make phone calls). i'm told i'll get used to it and never be able to go back to anything smaller, though, so we'll see. setup: this was the easiest set-up i've ever done. the phone walks you through set-up, and gives you the option to use nfc to transfer all of the data from your old phone onto the new one. it might have been wishful thinking on my part, but i'd hoped this would mean not only transferring the apps themselves, but the information from within the apps, my wallpaper, pictures, etc. nope. it did transfer all of my google stuff, and automatically downloaded all of the apps from the play store, but i still had to login to all of the accounts and, in the case of some (e.g., my checkbook app, which is basically a digital check register), re-enter all of my data. none of my wallpapers or widgets or other customizations transferred over. most of my personalized stuff from the galaxy s4 was stored on an sd card, rather than on the device's internal memory, so maybe that might explain why it didn't sync to the extent i'd hoped. regardless, the nfc transfer is an awesome feature and no doubt saved me a lot of time. a tip i learned from reading other reviews: leave the sim card out during set-up and connect to the internet via wifi instead, and let the phone do all of its updating (including if it is updating from android os 5.0 to 5.1) before even thinking of inserting the sim. there were some horror stories of people who followed set-up instructions to put the sim card in first, only to end up with the carrier using that as a vehicle to carrier-lock the phone and add bloatware. i don't know if this would have happened had i inserted my sim card first, but figured "why risk it?" also good to know: if you're on a carrier that uses sim cards, it's unlikely your current sim card will work in this device, as it uses a nano sim card, which is a relatively new thing in the android world. most likely, you've currently got a micro sim card, and will need to contact your carrier and buy/order a new sim card. there are internet tutorials on cutting a micro sim card down to nano sim card size and then filing/sanding it down to nano card thickness, but that's just way too involved and risky. . . better to just go get a new nano sim card. the camera: i've only taken a couple of pictures, in well-lit places, and they look decent, but i feel like the galaxy s4 takes crisper, more vibrant photos and has a more intuitive camera app. maybe i'll just need to start using a third-party camera app. motorola/android lollipop vs. samsung galaxy s4/touch whiz/android jelly bean: this phone seems to process things noticeably faster than the galaxy s4, but that could also have to do with that most of the things on my s4 were on an sd card, whereas everything i use on the nexus 6 is more readily available on the internal phone memory. i was not a fan of the ambient notifications, so i turned those off. i could not stand the big, white, ugly google search bar at the top of the screen. the google launcher does not allow you to remove it, or even move or resize it. the placement of it at the very top of the screen doesn't make any sense from a user standpoint. maybe that's just where they thought it would be least intrusive. i had to install nova launcher in order to get rid of the google search bar, and to get back some of the functionality i lost in switching from samsung to motorola. and, speaking of the user-unfriendly placement of the google search bar, the "power" and "volume" button placement likewise do not make sense. the power button and volume buttons are on the right side of the phone, halfway down the phone. this doesn't make sense, as the majority of people are right-handed, and given that most people grip a phone from the middle rather than the bottom or the top. the buttons are in the way when you're trying to hold the phone, and hard to get at when you're actually in a call and need to turn the volume up or down. i'm put off that there is no quick and easy way to switch from silent to vibrate to sound, and access other commonly used features that were oh-so-accessible when you pulled down the menu on the galaxy. on the nexus, you have to go to the app drawer, then scroll down to "settings," then go to "sound & notification," and then individually control the volume of media, alarms, and ring volume from there. speaking of "settings," i noticed there are much fewer options available on the nexus than on the galaxy series. everyone talks about getting the super customizable "pure android" experience, but with this device i feel like my hands are tied in a lot of respects. and, as far as the "no bloatware" claim, nothing could be further from the truth: google pre-installed a bunch of their own apps (drive, hangouts, play games, play newsstand, play music, play books, slides, keep, google photos (which requires also having a google + account-- no thanks!), etc.) and you can't uninstall them. the best you can do is disable the app, uninstall any updates to it (e.g., bring it back to the factory version, which is usually slightly smaller in file size), and "disable" the app. . . but it still exists on the phone, taking up valuable internal memory space on a phone that doesn't have any option for sd card expansion. i think someone coming over to the nexus 6 from the moto x would be really happy since it's basically the moto x except bigger and better. but coming over from the samsung galaxy series, i'm not very impressed. as it stands right now, this phone is 3 stars (just "okay"), but for the price (on sale on amazon to make way for the nexus 6p) and the fact that it is unlocked and one of the few phones that work with the new google fi network (which i haven't switched to. . . yet) and will get updates before many other phones do, i feel like it is a very good deal and worth the money. i also feel like i shouldn't rush to judgment until i've had more time to acclimate to it, and i think it does have potential if i can figure out how to better customize it (without rooting it and voiding the warranty, and without having to install a bunch of third party work-around apps), so i am bumping up to four stars .   very big phone. worth the price though. the battery life is great i'm usually watching videos or streaming on netflix for a few hours at a time and it's front facing speakers are amazing really loud and it's screen looks beautiful only downsides are it's hard to handle with just one hand cause of its size and if you turn the brightness real low it's got like a pink tint to everything. excellent phone! works perfectly in argentina. yes. it doesn't have wifi calling .   great phone for the price. big vibrant screen plus all the android bells and whistles. i would buy it again .   this is a great phone! can not be beat for the price, and the support that goes along with this phone is awesome .   great phone. it's just too big .   there few problems with touch screen being buggy. this is a really good phone big sharp screen, front dual speakers, stock android.this phone is packing but the phone stutters at times and the camera isn't terrible but not the best either and the battery could be better but nonetheless its an awesome phone at a good price. what i like the most about this phone is the size, resolution and processing power. the camera sucks but its not completely terrible though my nokia lumia 925's camera was significantly better. however, the photospheres this thing takes are out of this world. my biggest complaint is the battery life. if you don't use it at all, it can last you maybe a day or two. light users will be okay with this but i'm a heavy user and i've ran out of power a couple of times while out so i had to get a second wall and portable charger. got the aukey brand, they seem to be okay so far and there are discounts on their fb page. the charger does charge it really fast with the qualcomm quick charge 2.0. you can get enough juice for a few hours with just 15 minutes worth of charging .   i love the phone and the natural state of android. it was easy to sideload marshmallow. before upgrade from 5.1 to 6.0 no wifi calling, now have the option, and appears to be hooked up to t-mobile wi-fi calling, but if you dig deep into the operating system, the wi-fi calling is not active, states no wi-fi calling package. but, it seems to work as i got a wi-fi call today. so it works on inbound. it indicates the it is connected outbound as well in the ui menu. hangouts calling with google voice goes through wi-fi as well. i am just concerned the phone will have challenges with the free international data on t-mobile since their system doesn't recognize the imei .   as a previous nexus 5 owner this was a great upgrade! the only thing i miss is a notification light .   it's working as per my expectations. everything is perfect. good phone. bought google phone with 64gb, but freezes every now and then and reboot clears it. not sure if my apps or data is overly loaded but i thought 64gb would be enough. when the phone becomes unresponsive, only a reboot can clear it. its rather large phone but i am finally used to carrying it and use it as a phablet. no more dependent on a 8" tablet i used to carry along. screen is sharp and now i can use it to watch movies or tv shows in bed. excellent phone for $399 after the price drop .   great phone for the money. screen is awesome .   stopped charging after not even a full year. just flashes the battery symbol while dead but won't hold charge. for a $400 phone i'm disappointed .   great phone for the price .   this phone with android 6.0 is marvellous experience. highly recommended .   really good value. this phone works great once you update to marshmallow. until i updated to marshmallow, the battery life sucked horribly .   great phone, delivered on time and as expected. great cellphone .   i had a samsung note 2, a phone that was released 2 years before and it worked much better. i'm returning mine after having it for a month. the low-light camera is basically non-existant, i don't even try to take pictures at night anymore. also, i had a problem where my phone decided to stop sending out text messages and receiving messages, i had no idea it was doing it. i was making people mad, and getting mad at people for unresponsiveness. i had to reset my phone and once i did, i received all the messages at once. i've only had this phone a month, in today's fast-paced, hyper-connected world that is just not acceptable haha .   excellent choice for a great smartphone, cheap and useful, i'm happy with this purchase. great phone, my first android and honestly its great. people are going to say the screens too big, but once you start using it you won't go back to a smaller screen. only thing is its hard to text with one hand, and the front facing camera is only 2mp, but that's only bad things i can say. great phone and even better price compare to that of other phones at the same price range. cheers,. excellent cell phone. the presentation, software, hardware are perfect. i recommended this cell phone .   i decided to sign up projectfi and my note 2 wasn't going to be able to carry over, so i decided to get the 64gb nexus 6 while it was on the deal of the day (convenient timing!). i have owned the phone now for almost 2 months and decided that i have had an appropriate amount of time to formulate an appropriate review. [physical phone] :: size :: the phone itself is slightly larger than my old note 2 - both in size and screen. so far i have barely even noticed that it is slightly larger to my happy surprise. i recently took it on a hot air balloon ride tour and had no problem hanging it over the side and taking pictures. the weight and size feels like a perfect fit for my hand. :: sound :: this is one of the best, and smartest, features about this phone. it has two front facing speakers. the reason for the emphasis on the front facing part is because most phones have the speakers facing the rear. not only do you lose sound value from the phone, but you don't get a sense of immersion. this has been fixed with this phone. the dual front facing speakers give the feeling of surround sound, which is great when you are watching a movie on your phone. this also helps when you are using the phone as a speaker phone, because the sound comes through much greater and clearer. :: camera :: this is both great and bad. the great part is the rear facing camera. it has a decent megapixel rating (12), performs pretty good in most lighting situations, and the video records in 4k, which is surprising and very clear. the bad part is the front facing camera - this also felt like an after thought. flesh tones seem off and the camera tends to shoot grainy or blurry. personally i hate selfies, so this doesn't really affect me much. :: screen :: this was the biggest disappoint. the screen in a regular setting is beautiful - very crisp and clear and the color contrast is absolutely amazing. the huge con of this is when you start getting glare from the sun. the screen becomes almost unviewable, which in this day and age is unacceptable. [phone performance] :: processing :: the phone really performs here. programs open up almost seamlessly and i have not noticed any stuttering or slowdowns when playing really graphically intense games. :: battery :: i do not like the fact that the new age phones do not allow you to physically swap the battery, because i only imagine headaches down the road when the battery ultimately fails, but the battery that is included in pretty decent. seems like i can watch movies and/or play games pretty intensely for several hours straight without any worries. overall i would say this was a very good phone released by motorola, which some glaring (pun intended) mistakes. overall: 4.0/5.0. i like it :) stable, fast and nice but the back cover is a bit slippery. awesome phone, super fast. best phone i have ever owned! i bought the used version through ecellular and it came looking as if it was brand new. i love the big display because it is very easy for me to type as i have big fingers and hands. everything works perfectly fine. i am using project fi, but i've heard it works with all carriers, just make sure you have a nano sim card .   solid phone. the phone is built well and feels high quality. the buttons feel elegant and are not that sensitive which is great since most phones have sensitive buttons which turns them on when they should be on. overall the phone is solid and the charging speed is awesome too. the battery life is questionable since my old one plus phone still has better battery life than the nexus 6 .   my nexus 6 has a sound distortion problem when i'm talking to someone. the static sounding noise prevents me from hearing clearly. hopefully the os update fixe the problem .   this is the second nexus 6 i purchased, but the first from amazon. q: when isnâ€™t a cell phone too big? the motorola-made, google-branded phablet answers that question for me, and may very well for you. from samsungâ€™s introduction of the original note, i scoffed at large-screen smartphonesâ€”and, honestly, the seemingly stereotypical gadget geeks using them. but big is better, and my arrogant attitude about phablets and the people buying them was unwarranted. simply stated: alongside the new nexus 6p, nexus 6 is the best handset i have ever used. the experience is so fresh and delightful, the emotional reaction reminds of using the original iphone that i purchased on launch day in june 2007. n6 shatters my negative preconception about phablets, particularly unwieldiness when used daily. that said, i made some lifestyle changes, including choice of clothing, to accommodate the mobileâ€™s massive size. my hands arenâ€™t large, but i nevertheless find nexus 6 comfortable to hold in one hand. the width is quite manageable thanks to the flat bezel and back shell that curves outward. by contrast, iphone 6 plus is way too slippery, because of the aluminum enclosure, its flatness, and the overly-rounded bezel. i regard the rounded outside of the 6 plus or 6s plus frame to be a design flaw. either of the two newest apple handsets are the first for which i must recommend a case as means of reducing the likelihood of drops and protecting against them. despite its size, nexus 6 grips easily such no case is required. i use mine bareback, so to speak. letâ€™s be mr. spock specific: the amoled display measures 5.96 inches diagonally. resolution is 2560 x 1440, and pixel density is 493. i thought the iphone 6 plus 1920 x 1080, 401-ppi screen was magnificent, until seeing nexus 6. colors pop and contrast is rich. i typically grab nexus 6 before any tablet, and my mainstay slate is nexus 9. superior-quality display is but one reason. most android apps, and their notifications, are better optimized for the phablet-size. magazines i used to happily read on ipad air and grumpily consume on n9, such as economist or rolling stone, are preferred on nexus 6. reading is immersive, text is razor sharp, and photos or video look fantastic. streaming from services like hbo, netflix, or starz surprisingly satisfy. summed up differently: display size, resolution, and pixel density matched with the front-facing speakers and the phabletâ€™s handling are finely balanced. for an always-carry device, these and other benefits eliminate any pretense for owning a tablet. you can read more in the review on my personal site, which includes photos: http://joewilcox.com/2015/03/24/nexus-6-review/. if you have an unlocked nexus 6 and are on at&t  .  and probably any other carrier, don't attempt to install any available ota updates while the sim card is inserted. if you do, your *unlocked* nexus will be branded to at&t .  or probably whatever carrier you have .  and you will no longer receive google updates, but rather carrier updates. this means when google releases updates for nexus devices, your nexus 6 will not receive them. you will have to wait for at&t .  or your specific carrier .  to release the update for your nexus 6. there have been reports in some forums that being branded to at&t interferes with the project fi service from google. if so, this causeas me to think this is a way for at&t to fight against project fi .  by secretly making nexus 6 phones becomes tied to its network. i can tell you that my nexus 6 received the lmy48w build number, which is at&t firmware. any nexus 6 with that build number will never receive android updates directly from google. all future updates will come from at&t .   nice cellphone .   fast shipping, great phone. perfect. beware build # lnx07m. i purchased two nexus 6 each arrived brand new, but different build numbers. one worked perfectly, but the second with build# lnx07m was inoperable. it would not download and update the android operating system. had to return this phone for a replacement .   i'm very happy with my nexus, the screen size is perfect. it does everything i need and then some .   check reviews on youtube. things to remember: omelet screen , size of the phone, compatible with project fi. good price. fast, almost without ui glitches and bugs. very good sound from sound speakers and the camera is really awesome .   great phone, works with verizon 4g lte without having to contact verizon. just insert sim card and you're up and running in minutes. i had to trim my sim, so i bought a $7 sim card trimmer, which made it easy. the bluetooth is fiddly and doesn't always connect to my car, though, and the screen is too dim in bright sunlight. overall, however, i'm satisfied with the purchase .   great phone .   yes, for the week i used it. ibarely tapped the corner of the phone and now it has a crack down the front of it. very upset with how easy it was to crack the screen .   exactly as expected. fast (really fast) and with a long battery life. great phone .   the best phone i ever owned .  pure android, big screen, battery last all day with medium use,udated to andriod 6.0, loud stereo front speakers, beautiful omled screen .   best phone that i ever had i love the nexus 6 you need this phone if you looking for a new one .   i've had the nexus 4 & 5 phones and loved them. great phones. i now have 6 purchases from amazon. however .   i've had it a month and its frozen and rebooted itself 4 times. i was texting in hangouts this morning when screen went 3/4 black and froze. after about a minute it began to reboot. comes back up fine. it's odd. just sharing. when it works i love it. thinking of returning before it's too late .   this phone is recommend for big hand. the build quality on the phone is above average not excellent. the micro usb port (aluminium frame with plastic together) build quality is bad not in the center. i would said check out the nexus 6p before buying this nexus 6 .   received this device about a month prior to this review. shipped and sold by amazon. not my first nexus phone. both the dw and myself had nexus 4's as well as other android smart phones and devices. the nexus line is sometimes referred to as a developer's phone, maybe true prior to the more mainstream availability of the nexus 4. it offers a "pure android" experience. some might say its a platform for google to showcase the direction it intends to take its operating system. for the most part, i prefer an unforked version of android, but did enjoy some of the software features built into the ui by other android smartphone manufactures. i skipped the nexus 5 and carried a lg 3. while it was a great device and offered some great features, it sometimes was a bit janky. as for the nexus 6 with the recent drop in price of this phone, it may arguably be the best bang for the buck going. it also can offer a ton of carrier savings if google's "project fi" mnvo works for you. currently, my wifes nexus 6 is on project fi and her bill is coming in around 32.00 a month. this is a tremendous savings for us over what her current t-mobile plan was costing. she is extremely satisfied with her project fi service and nexus 6. i was motivated by the price to jump back into a nexus. was not that pleased with the original price of the nexus 6, so i purchased the lg g3 at a much lower cost. we always pay outright for our devices, sometimes from amazon, sometimes from the playstore and sometimes at t-mobile. the lg g3 has a better screen than this phone. imho, the layout of the camera and volume buttons on the g3 was way more practical as well as a few other software features. but, hated being stuck on android version 5.0, and that's the beauty of a google nexus device, quick updates and current software. while this phone is more than adequate for my needs and at its current price recommend it, honestly i will likely purchase the nexus 6p as soon as it becomes available again on the play store. google is now offering a protection plan, that along with project fi is pushing me to leave t-mobile. i may change my mind after this phone receives its marshmallow update, but reviews of the new 6p are extremely positive. i do have a project fi sim coming for this device and there are good arguments that the new nexus 6p is not spec wise, that big of an upgrade to warrant the costs. in close, there are many reviews covering every little nuance of the nexus 6, its performance, features and hardware. guess, i choose to consider it's overall value and potential if you factor that it is also one of the few devices that can be used with project fi. if i expressed my opinion, on the android side, i think samsung's newest device's are the best, but there is other factors. will add, really like using android pay. it is working seamlessly with this device at merchants that support it. hope it sees more merchant support. this device also plays nicely with my blue tooth devices, chromecast and hot spotting to my chromebook while traveling .   working great .   just took delivery of the nexus 6 so these are my impressions after a week of use. i will update my review should any of my opinions change as i spend more time with the device. there are a bunch of reviews that talk about the system crashing - but i have not experiences any of these to date (perhaps it is the fact the system has been upgraded to marshmallow already). time will tell on this. originally i bought this to replace my nexus 7 tablet as i had no intentions of using the nexus 6 as my primary cell phone. however as soon as i got the nexus 6 in my hands (literally) i realized the device was so much better than my current cell phone (moto x 1st generation). i immediately switched my sim card over to the nexus 6 (both devices use a nano sim card). the feel of the device is really good and as i am already a "two handed-texter" - the ability to text or type with one hand (given the size of the device) - is not important to me. being able to drop down to a single device (tablet and cell phone) more than makes up for the requirement to use two hands to effectively text or respond to email. but for sure, this is not a device for the one-handed cell user. i looked at all the tablets that are on the market today - and they have all grown in screen size and i wanted to stay with a 7 inch screen. as an aside .   there were a couple of 7 inch tablets (asus and samsung) i could have bought to replace my nexus 7 - but they all have bad reviews (performance, crashes, etc) or are so under-configured (memory and/or processing power) that i doubt they will last the next couple of years. decided i would rather have a smaller 6 inch screen than a crappy 7 inch tablet. my nexus 7 tablet eventually "pooped" out as new larger releases of the operating system were installed on the device. given the dramatic price reduction of the nexus 6 and its compute power and 32gb of storage - the nexus 6 made more sense to me (remember new operating systems never get smaller) good things about the device .   already automatically updated to android 6.0 (marshmallow). a pleasant surprise very good battery life (i am not a heavy video user so check other reviews for this type of use pattern) love the quick charge feature - never going to buy a cell phone without this again quick transfer of applications etc between devices was done simply by tapping the two devices together ability to use phone on project fi (waiting for my request to be approved). sick of getting raped by the att's of the world. still comes with google 1 year warranty love that the speakers are in the front clean install of android - no vendor bloatware not so good things about the device .   really, really slippery - just had to order a case with non-slip surface fits in my pant pockets but would be cautious of putting in my shirt pocket for fear of it falling out wouldn't try running with this on my arm - really would look like a dork took me a while to realize i needed to move my ear up to the top of the phone to hear the caller wish the mic was on the front of the phone one last thing not so good thing .   i don't like the position of the on/off and volume buttons (middle of phone). i know they are placed where they are so you can use the buttons using the device in one hand as a phone - but when using the phone as a tablet - it is a little awkward trying to balance the phone e.g. while using the device to "read" with my kindle application for example. keep shutting the phone off when i tap to change pages (as noted above the phone is really slippery). hopefully this gets solved with my new non-slip case. all in all pretty happy with the nexus 6. hopefully marshmallow has eliminated any of the issues some of the other reviewers have experienced. as noted i will update my review should i experience any issues. update 10/25/2015 .   just installed my non slip case (cimo slim soft case) and this has solved my hand slipping on the nexus 6. also as the cimo case has raised soft plastic "buttons" that go over the nexus 6 power and volume buttons, i have also eliminated turning on the phone by mistake (when hand slips down). another good thing about the case is it does not cover the motorola dimple on the back so your hand can still "find" the "dimple" to properly locate your hand on the device. lots of the other cases cover this up .   i love this phone my first venture into the nexus world and loving stock android  .   and the hardware just makes it even better .   lag is pretty much non existent and thankfully my hand are big so size is not an issue  .   moved from an iphone 4s which i used for almost 4 years. hopefully this lasts just as long .   battery life superior to samsung. great phone, 5 star service from amazon. for the past 2 months works perfectly. there are a lot of bugs with ringing and dtmf which is part of android .   great phone .   the heat problem is strong with this one .   excellent smartphone. with the lower price (currently at $399.99 for the 64gb version), there really isn't any reason not to get this phone. pure android guarantees great performance without having to worry about other oems taking android, adding way too much custom software, and making it lag and buggy (looking at you samsung). plus, nexus means you get every android update immediately. when looking for a new phone, i picked this one over the new moto x because the snapdragon 805 in the nexus 6 is actually faster than the 808 amd 810. it's just a quad core instead of hexacore (808) or octacore (810). plus, the gpu of the snapdragon 805 is actually a more powerful one than in the 808. the snapdragon 805 was actually going to be the top tier processor for a while before apple made the huge push into 64bit processors so everyone had to catch up for some reason. the dual front facing stereo speakers are loud, clear, and sound great. the camera is good, not great, but it takes photos you won't be mad at. the screen is gorgeous, so looking at it while playing games or web browsing is a real joy. overall, this is a fantastic phone, and since its a nexus, will last you for a very long time .   great phone, one minor problem is it become hotter when i use it for too long time .   i love nexus. good enough .   bought the nexus 6, what a great deal for 64 gb. i feel the new nexus 6p is going to be great as well, but lets see how it goes first. this phone has a lot of speed and for me the screen size is great. switching from an htc one m7 and loved the phone but not the sprint network. update-jan 13, 2016. i'm totally satisfied with the nexus 6, running on google fi's network. the phone is constantly searching for wifi networks to connect during the day. there's a lot of hotspots where i live plus my home network. my last 2 months cell bill is under $30 for a 2 gb plan. just received android 6.01 update. battery lasts the whole day, crystal clear calls on google fi and phone never lags. movies and sound are fantastic. phone size is great for my large hands. right now, great deal on amazon for this phone .   stepping up from a note 2 (and i still love the note 2 with cm12 on it) this upgrade only seemed logical. i love the screen size. the additional .5 inch makes a difference for me. more is better. period. front facing stereo speakers are great for youtube and occasional netflix. lastly the storm trooper white look feels different and sexy. my first piece unfortunately turned out faulty and i asked for a replacement which went through just fine. enjoying the upgrade. amezing. happy with 95% of an 800 dollar phone for 50% of the price. i bought this to go with the google fi program. straight to the point: *no bloatware from cell phone companies. so i feel it runs smoother with less issues. *camera quality is good. compared with my spouses iphone 5 at night and it seems the night mode was a bit better. *antennae isn't as strong as the iphone 6 that just came out but it is also older than the iphone 6. seems to be pretty comparable to the iphone 5 antennae .   great product. front camera is pretty weak .   reception and call quality - 10/10 the call quality and the reception received is superb with no problems whatever. it works for cdma and gsm networks a truly global phone coming unlocked out of the box. display 9/10 5.96 quad hd display, colors are so vivid and high brightness setting is very good for outdoors. this is a great big screen for reading and watching movies, but its also not the latest gorilla glass 4 and although its amoled its not super-amoled; coming from samsung i see a huge difference in the technology. battery life 9/10 turbo charge seriously works in just 1.5 hours. the battery usually last for a day with moderate use so no big complaints here. it would be great if it was a replaceable battery. camera 5/10 in day light its a great camera with gorgeous colors and very good quality overall, but at low light its pretty much unusable. so if your really into the camera this isn't the phone for you especially for night shots, don't even think about it. and this is the main reason why i give it a 4 out of 5 score for this review. ease of use 10/10 very easy to use with stock android, no bloatware means a fast and trouble free android experience. design and form factor 10/10 this doesn't feel very plastic at all, its some premium material makes it feel really high end than a lot of phones. the curve back is great idea, shocking even though its a big phone you are able to use one hand because of that curved backed. the greatest design is the two front firing speakers which is probably the loudest and clearest sounds coming out in any smartphone at the moment. portability (size / weight) 10/10 very slim in size at 10mm and able to fit in my pockets with a comfortable curved back. also i loved how the weight is in the heavier side of 184 grams, makes it feel premium; i say its the prefect weight for a phone this size. value 10/10 was it worth it when it was released .   i don't think so. but today after a year being priced at $350 from its released price of $650, its worth every single penny. for this price you're really getting an outstanding phone that you cannot go wrong with. i find it to be a better value than the new nexus 6p if you really don't care about the camera .   unlocked, so no bloat-ware. got all updates .  fast. registered online with verizon without issue. it's about time v caught on. now if they can get rid of that old cdma architecture .   this phone seems better in almost every way than google's latest nexus phones that just came out .   i like it. excellent phone. overall satisfied with it. ultimately decided it wasn't the phone for me because it was too difficult to hold with one hand .   shipping as expected. correct product .   if you're going to buy an android phone, buy a nexus. they are virgin android experience. they also get the quickest updates! i had a first gen moto x and loved it, except for the screen size. i'm absolutely in love with my nexus 6! i would recommend this phone to anyone .   there isn't much on how to use the phone. you just have to use it and figure it out .   generally i love motorola products because they are the ones who actually invented the cellphone but then they fell behind a little with the smart phones - until recently. overall their smartphones have improved dramatically. i returned this nexus 6 because as soon as i got it appeared used with some slight blemishes on it. when i tried to activate it the phone immediately needed an update. when i tried to update it the phone never worked again it keep turn on and off by itself. i followed all the instructions to reset it but i could never get it to work. the price was good even cheaper then the manufacturer motorola itself. however i ended up buying the new motorola x pure edition from motorola directly where they make the phone and engrave it for me on the spot so i am sure i am getting a brand new working phone. and i do love my new phone it's even better than the nexus 6. when the nexus 6 is working. i'm very happy with this phone. after a week of use i must say that it is a highly recommend phone for someone in the market for big screen phones. fantastic big screen and good battery life .   what can i say, it's a nexus phone and it's dan and night difference from my old samsung phone. although, 6" screen is a little too big. only problem i have with this $350 phone is the charger's cable length, it is too short, 3' maybe .   works great with t-mobile i decided to sideload the marshmallow update versus wait for the ota. wifi calling works great and visual voicemail is built into the operating system. not too big wouldn't go back to a smaller phone .   really like the phone. one thing to mention, if you run it in china with china net 4g carrier, there could be some issues on mobile data connection. at least in my circumstance, i still need to find a way to make it run smoothly .   great phone .   good, very good. awesome phone. very fast. upgraded rom to pure nexus. meet my expectations and more. glad i didn't get the note 4 or iphone 6 plus. it would have increased my monthly phone charges from $50 to 79 for new contract, plus the 3-400 for the phone (400 for note 4, or 300 for iphone). its a v good phone, but v fragile. one fall and the screen shattered! it was 3 weeks new and i dropped it once and .   i was used to samsung and i dropped it 100's of times, but this one .   i don't like a big case, this case is perfect .   excellent .   excellent features. love the big display and clearness. i fully recommend it .   too big for one hand operation otherwise nice phone. i love this phone, its awesome. was able to root it no problem. found a great rom that is quick and running marshmallow. if your looking for a daily driver, this would be it. if you are looking for a phone that is mainly used for a camera, you may want to look somewhere else .   wow, what a difference than my last phone. this thing is great .   i really expected it to be smaller than it actually is. my fault after all. but the quality, design, as well as its features are incredible. if you are used to handle 6-inch cellphones, you will definitely love it .   oh my goodness i love it sooooo much! i am an avid android lover, and actually came from my nexus 5, it is such a great phone, big, but i love it .   don't regret this purchase at all .   it's gorgeous and the best phone i've got so far .   super display. easy to use, and works with verizon (us model). just had to put my sim card from old phone in and good to go. this thing is huge .   best phone i've ever owned. bought it a year ago and am definitely keeping it for another year. i have the perfect setup. great custom rom with xposed framework and nethunter 3.102 nightly installed (with full kali linux 2.0 installation). my laptop dual boots windows 10 and kali 2 and my nexus 6 outperforms my laptop by 10x when running linux tools. i bought an alfa awus036neh adapter for $20 and a really good usb-to-microusb adapter and penetration testing against my home network is fast and efficient! combine this phone with google fi and my phone bill never exceeds $30. one month, my bill was only $14.38. google and motorola hit it outta the park with this one. it's a shame it was discontinued .   refund .   love my new nexus .   i like the phone .its working good .   my son is happy with it. good phone smooth and fast. battery life is okay hopefully better once marshmallow arrives. a little wide for the hand but screen real estate is sweet. front facing speakers nice for multimedia. not perfect but stock android is nice .   great smartphone, no bloatware from verizon and i can now control all the settings on my phone there by greatly increasing my phones run time. i can easily go 3 days running chroma rom .   great phone. my only complaint is that it's enormous. i think that 6" is too big for a phone, but i didn't pay close enough attention and missed that part of the description. my bad, so i can't dock a star. other than that, the phone is great .   is great .   i liked the phone except fast battery drain and it freeze sometime. funciona perfectamente con metropcs. works perfect on metropcs network .   every thing about it is good, i was lumia user and was very much comfortable with win8.1 phone .   few hiccups @ first .   now comfortable. i purchased this for my father, who had previously been using a galaxy s-something. the larger screen is better for his failing eyesight, and, unlike the samsung, is not chalk-full of bloatware .   while the phone functions ok, i asked and said the phone was manufacturer unlocked, unprogrammed. nexus phones allow hotspot and tethering; this one was carrier modified to deny that feature. original nexus phones don't do that. it's a function i use on occasion that's very important to me. unfortunately unless i want to possibly destroy the phone by opening the source code to re-enable this feature by unlocking it totally, i'll have to live with what i get. if you want tethering or hotspot, don't buy from this seller .   i can't recommend this phone enough .   overall, it is a great phone. i was worried that the size would be uncomfortable when making phone calls but that is not the case. (i have average size hands for a male) i have not used the camera much so i can't speak to that. sound quality is good when making phone calls, browsing speed is very good, the front facing speakers are great for a phone (why don't all phones have that) and the screen is very good. the only real complaint i have is the placement of the physical keys to unlock the screen and control the sound. i find myself occasionally hitting those keys on accident .   isn't expensive and works fine. yes it did. the phone works like a dream. very please and looking forward to getting one for my wife .   working good. excellent phone. nice phone! very easy to operate, nice display and above all worth the money. the only problem is my phone produces a weird sound for a sec when i unlock the phone, that's the reason why i am giving 4stars .   i love this phone. great build quality, incredible screen. apps respond really fast and the battery lasts me a day and a half. not to mention is far less expensive than an unlocked iphone with similar stats. i use it on straight talk with excellent reception and data speeds. it came with 5.1.1 and am looking forward to seeing 6.0 on it .   i love my new phone. it was quite a bit larger than what i had but it did not take long for me to get used to it. now whenever i see a smaller phone i don't know how i managed with such a small screen. i don't think i could go back to a smaller phone and i don't want to .   best cell phone i have had to date. if you are an existing verizon customer, you can simply install your sim card and go. (in my case, i had to use a sim card cutter to reduce sim card from a micro sim to a nano sim.). phone has excellent reception. no call drops. nexus 6 shipped with lollipop but has already updated to marshmallow .   packed nicely and reached safely .   i have been using my nexus 6 for a few days now. i was aware of the "pink" effect the display had if you turned the brightness all the way down in adaptive brightness. but my screen turned blue. even when i turn my phone off. i can see the blue tint on the screen mostly when i'm outside exposing the screen to sunlight or inside with regular lightbulbs. does anybody experience this? is this normal? should i send it back .   customer service attitude is very good, is the logistics slow point .   this may be last year's model, but it is an excellent phone! be prepared to deal with having a huge beast on your hands, but you would not need to carry a phone and a tablet. as i travel a lot, this is great since it lightens my load. in kind, it is really nice to have a nice big screen to work with. the curvature of the phone helps it fit better in my hands. however, i do notice that i rarely go one-handed with it. the speed is acceptable, and security updates are quick since one does not have to wait for mobile phone providers to get into the loop .   what .   the. what even. i don't. sentences grammar can't i even now. you can't expand storage with a microsd card. i have a 128gb microsd card sitting here with my entire music collection, a million great pictures, and .   i can't use it. i didn't even think to check this before ordering the phone. what phone in 2015 would not have a microsd slot capability .   i guess i'll stick with the phone, since samsung's gear broke after only 2.5 weeks of use (so i'm giving up on samsung), but i'm really disappointed in this .   this phone is excellent, no lags at all. i like it till now, the good thing about this phone is the screen size and clarity .   great phone takes beautiful photos, speaker in front instead of back, nice size screen .   when i use wechat or qianniu,volume so low.whatsapp same .   i seem to have problems with it dropping connection to vz. not while i am in a phone call, but it looses the signal and data, switching airplane mode off and on does not work, must be rebooted. it is large, until you hold it in your hand, it is hard to imagine the size. i also have a heavy duty case so it is a little bigger but i would rather protect the phone. other than that, the screen is great, very fast, no other problems that come to mind. if you have the screen brightness on max and text a little, browse a little, the battery will not last the day .   nearly perfect, just kind of huge. i love the 6 inch hd screen & stereo front facing speakers! nexus is the best! i love getting the newest version of android right when it comes out .   good. good. switched from iphone 5s. very happy with size and design of nexus 6. i originally purchased the iphone as it was required for work. never really drank the apple coolaid and happy to switch back to a more intuitive system. in addition, also switched from t-mobile to google project fi. very happy with both .   very nice phone with big bright screen and a great value very hard to find screen protection, so buy one with online .   good. though onbtge bigger side it does serve all my purposes .   good. great phone. i love very fast and responsive work with my attorney sim card i randomly switch between my note 4 and nexus 6. picked it up for my grandson and he is happy with his choice .   good .   only downside: it's a little too big. great value .   great phone, great price. this is my 5th nexus product and i love it. pure android experience without the bloatware .   i updated from the nexus 5 to the nexus 6 (not the nexus 6p). no buyer's remorse here .   excelent product  .   excellent. the device is huge and not for everyone, but i have gotten used to it and at the discounted price it was a great deal. if you want a big phone, pure android automatically updated by google, with dual front facing speakers, don't hesitate. at the discounted price this phone has some advantages even over the nexus 6p in my opinion .   the phone itself is brilliant. big beautiful screen, blazing processor and great camera. however be warned that this is not an authorized motorola reseller. if you buy this phone from consumit motorola will not cover it under warranty or at all .   like the screen and the processor. but battery life is pathetic. for me that is the most important thing in a cellphone so this one went right back to amazon .   it does not have a good reception. i used with it straighttalk on att, it was barely usable. i had to return it .   very nice bought at $349. i'm having issues with the nexus. i transferred all my data from my samsung. the screen freeze and the front speakers are not clear or loud when i place calls on speaker. overall its a ok phone .   very good, but power consumption too fast .   i just received this today, came overnight to alaska. sending it back. i wanted to love it, but within the first hour 1/2 the screen froze up on me. it did this several times. speaker crackled too. i researched all the phones and their problems, as all phones have problems or glitches, none are perfect. i am currently on a galaxy s5. i like to change phones about every 6-8 months. the search goes on. amazon is always great about returns. thank goodness .   awesome i love this phone! 64gb for $400 great deal, great phone. i'm a power user and have had to charge twice a day surfing the internet multi tasking and basically on for 4 hrs at a time. not the greatest energy efficiency but what a nice screen, and the charger works faster than regular ones. i got sick of waiting for htc to make another nice large phone but after 3 years oh well. it is worth the change my wife's nexus 5 is a great phone so why not vanilla android what a great change. thanks google and motorola what a nice phone. also thank you amazon for the awsome price .   very good i like it .   awesome phone. quick change over with at&t. uses the micro sd card .   i was a little worried about the size of this phone when i purchased it and you probably are too since you're reading reviews, but rest assured: after using this phone for a couple weeks, i'm extremely pleased with the size of the screen. everything looks great! a huge viewfinder for pictures, plenty of space for web pages, and just more real estate for all your favourite apps. just make sure your pockets are big enough! i really like everything else too. the pure android os is really fast and intuitive, optical image stabilisation makes for great photos, and multitasking is super fast with the great specs. you're gonna love this phone .   excellent phone. have been using it a month now and i really like it .   after many years of dealing with verizon's shady tactics (bloatware, super cookies, delayed updates, and locked boot loaders) i made the jump to my first nexus phone. i'll tell you, this phone is amazing. first, stock android is super fast and efficient. i love getting updates the day they come out (i am already on the latest and greatest android 6.0 which came out a week ago). i rooted my phone just because i can. the display is a 6" quad hd, its so crisp and i love the size. it's very big, but you get used to it. i'll take the perks of a 6" display for its clumsiness. also, a little mentioned awesomeness is the front facing speakers, they're great. battery life is sweet too. overall a great phone, and will gladly upgrade to the 6p next year .   love the phone. i guess i got the version in line last for updates though but its still great. much more manageable than expected. this is a really solid phone. i've been making the move away from iphones recently and this phone is making it very easy to never look back. nice job motorola. nice job google. thanks very much. very much did! i've had it for over a month. i refuse to buy apple on principle. this phone is the android response and imo much better. apps are mostly free. this comes with barebone minimal apps unlike my previous samsung in which were stuck on my phone. i love this phone .   good phone. excellent phone, no problems. great deal, and a terrific phone. what more can i write: got via amazon limited time offer, $350.00. couldn't turn down the offer at that price. my son has a nexus 6 and he suggested my updating my existing phone (1+1) to the nexus 6. i am glad he suggested it .   note 3 damaged and still grandfathered with unlimited data with verizon so was on the hunt for a new phone.was looking for a note 4 ran across the nexus 6 and could not be happier. performance is awesome and screen is the of the best. very pleased. activated on metropcs in 5 minutes over the phone. received 5.1.1 ota, and 3 security patches within 3 days. all over wi-fi and no problems. registered for warranty with motorola and its for 14 months. very happy with this purchase .   i broke the screen :( it says us warranty so does that mean i can return it and get a new one .   i love my phone but its not the best selfie taker even for a 2.1 megapixel. good. a beautiful work of art with a great screen size , love it for its graphic quality and speed with size, also upgraded it to marshmallow. best of all paid half of the selling price which makes it the best deal in town . it may be a better quality than the new replacement .motorola is a bullet proof manufacture  .   great phone. love the larger screen fits well in my hand. highly recommended for those wanting a great phone at a great price .   i am so glad it doesn't have the pinkish screen which i was very worried about but its a bit warm but not too yellowish. i also didnt see whats the fuss about the size. i have small hands and its fine for me to hold. i dont have any problems of gripping it, one handed. i also did flash marshmallow so im all set to have this phone last me long for work since im not a power user so i'm hoping the doze feature work but it does work on my nexus 7 so it doesnt die that easily without it being plugged in all the time. my only complaint is the messenger so far, i can't make the background black unless i invert the colors so no custom sms features or colors like in the htc sense unless i use hangouts like everyone else or find another messenger with a black background. other then that, its a great phone. i do love the stereo facing speakers. not as good quality as my htc one m8 speakers but its good enough. the screen is perfect to me, i have a samsung galaxy tab s tablet with an uhd amoled screen and its calibrated about the same, so no complaints at all about the quality of the amoled screen. i would say, get it in this deal before it goes back to $499, i am very satisfied of picking it up for $350 .   i absolutely love this phone. the only thing i would've liked better in a phone of this size is a bigger battery to power that amazing screen for longer. other than that, no complaints. turbo charger is a god send. the front cam isn't great @ just 2mp but i am not a selfie crazy person. stock android looks and runs great but i am yet to receive marshmallow. google, are you listening .   i found out today that this phone is on ebay for 50 bucks less. dang .   i wish i could buy another one .   excellent. thus far, i'm very satisfied with the nexus 6, sorry i did not know of the newest release before hand, i would have waited .   i loved this phone .   big phone, with awesome response. huge quality screen and great camera. all that i want it. this phone is one of the best phones i ever use. i have only one issue about this phone, which is the calculator, the calculator have no percentage sign. i always use the calculator in my daily activities. i hope motorola and google will resolve this percentage issue. i love the phone .   hi the cell phone is greatttt .   but i need the invoice for the cell phone can you send me please, thank you .   what a great phone. i'm normally a samsung user, but the nexus 6 is super snappy and i really like the feel of it .   love this phone,. not the best but generally good, with good camera quality, processing speed, screen size is suitable for gaming and watching movie. anyway you may feel annoyed if you need to get crowded on public transport every day morning coz of the size. the most important thing for me is the system update of nexus device. already at the android 6.0 now. loves motorola a lot. hongkongers seems not much care about this brand. this phone is selling at hk by google play store at about us $550 and is surely not a reasonable price. here at amazon is much more attractive & i have recommended this to some of my friends .   overall outstanding phone! great replacement phone at a great price .   i love this phone, very vast, great screen and quality camera .   you can have the $800 samsung and apple phones, google and motorola have a quality product .   good. once you get used to the size, the phone is wonderful to use .   great sound, gorgeous screen, good phone all around .   extremely good phone and delivered well on time. upgraded from a nexus 4, which i loved. i'm still fond of that phone, and have kept it as a backup .  but this one is such an order of magnitude better. lte capable, an amazing display, and a much faster processor .   this phone i wanted to love and keep, but it has too many cons in my opinion. the battery life is not that good. i was getting 3 hours of screen time. the headset speaker is not the best when making phone calls. don't get it confused with the stereo front facing speakers which are great. i saw lots of nexus 6s with screen burn in, but that's the amoled screen. i was ok with the size and liked it, but i have to admit that it was a pain in the pocket. the camera is so so too. overall i think i would give it 3 stars .   love it, love it, love it .   it is a great phone overall, but the camera is one of the weak points. the first few days were ok, but after that, the camera had problems focusing and adjusting to light. even after resetting the phone to default, the same issues were happening indicating it was more of a hardware issue than a setting that was changed. however, if you need an awesome phone that has a sweet looking screen, you can't go wrong with this now given how much the price has dropped since new, its a bargain .   build quality is poor. battery cover separates from the body. i returned for a replacement and have same problem with the other right out of the box .   12 days, i achieved the phone. it is so beautiful. thank you .   i've had it for a week now and i'm very satisfied with it. coming from a nexus 5 and nexus 4, i decided to pass when nexus 6 was released on 2014. the main reason was it's size and the high price, and the fact that i was expecting a new version of nexus 5. now that nexus 5x was presented i was a bit disappointed with the specs for a 2015 nexus, so after giving it a good thought i decided to buy the nexus 6 at a great price and with very decent specs even now on 2015. the good: *great price *diaplay. i'm not a big fan of amoled, but it just looks beautiful. *size. yes it's big, but you get used to the size very quickly, and after a couple of days you will love it. it fits perfectly in my pocket, doesn't feel heavy. *storage. 32 gb is good enough for me. that should be the minimum standard for 2015, can't believe 5x starts at 16 gb *sound. simply superb. *it's a nexus. meaning pure android experience and the latest version available right now and constant updates for at least one more year. the bad: wifi issue. ii had some trouble connecting to my router. it kept disconnecting. sometimes it worked after resetting dsl modem or after restarting the phone. i ended up changing some setting in the router (band selection to auto) and that did the trick apparently. i'll update in case the issue persists. update. the issue persisted occasionally but disappeared completely after 6.0.1 update, so i guess it was some bug they corrected. now it's working perfectly and after a couple of months with it i couldn't be happier. tip: skip all the ota updates and flash android m factory image right away. it will save you time and you will have a fresh start with the latest android .   pros: it's superfast and doesn't lag anytime. speakers are awesome. cons: autofocus on camera is not that great. part of the silver print on the back came off within a week .   i had motorola maxx which was adequate but was filled with verizon bloatware and very poor internet performance. i took the phone to verizon store and they put a new sim card and in 5 min it was joy. i fix computers for living and when i return a computer with pure windows installed, i make most of my clients very happy. that is how happy i am .   the phone is so fast and pure joy to operate and read on it since it is 6 inches. i got the 64 gb to store videos on it! you can not go wrong with price, i sold my old phone for 120. so 400-120=280 :)) plus tax of course. i was an verizon store and they wanted to tie me up with another contract by offering 300 credit plus all their bloatware. i could not be happier. plus you will be the first to get android 6.0. marsh mellow. the camera also takes very good pictures. i also paid $129 to square trade for three years of protection and cancel my verizon $9/ month protection plan. so the final was $410 plus some tax .   wonderful - as i knew it would be .   this is fantastic! i am so happy with my purchase. not only the price is almost unbeatable, the product itself is really awesome! nexus 6 rocks .   perfect phone, bought off of amazon warehouse with "minor damage" and it ended up being the box had no stickers on it. the phone worked great out of the box and had all accessories with it. bought it just in time to have the android marshmallow 6.0 update come any day. the phone had a nice weight and feel due to the aluminum body, the front facing speakers are amazing. the 6" 1440p screen is gorgeous! the only downsides that i see, is the lack of an ir blaster and no fingerprint sensor. for ~$300 this is the best phone you can buy brand new .   awesome phone, battery life definitely lacking. dead by 5-7pm every day .   -pros- i've always been a huge fan of google's phones so i had high expectations for this product. the first thing i loved about this phone was the overall exterior design. i'm usually not a big fan of giant logos on phones, but motorola pulls it off beautifully. the screen itself is quite nice and large, not to mention extremely colorful. as with most motorola phones, the screen is more saturated than a typical smart phone leading to the intensification of colors which is simply beautiful. as of now, the phone has android lollipop. i have no complaints about android. it's in my opinion the most gorgeous and functional mobile os out there. the camera is pretty good .  for the most part (see cons). -cons- camera doesn't work well in low lighting. at all. i went from an lg g3 to a nexus 6, yet to me the g3's camera is vastly superior in darker settings. for some reason, on all motorola phones that i've tested this on, snapchat is extremely laggy and crashes frequently. i imagine that most people wouldn't actually care about that anyway, but i'm just giving you heads up. the battery life is .  so-so. it lasts me through a 5 hour school day followed by a 5 hour work shift, but with minimal usage. it of course all depends on what you're using the phone for! -summary- amazing design inside and out, great display, native android (a huge plus for me!). decent camera (though not in a low lighting), mediocre battery life .   very good. was a little worried when i ordered this phone since the reviews weren't as good as i expected. but i have no idea what some of these lukewarm reviews are talking about. i absolutely love this phone. it's beautiful and functional, and just feels amazingly fast. this is a much better one-handed phone with the "back" button on the left and the curved back. really happy i could get this one for $400 .   a little disappointed in battery life, but i was experiencing decreased life on my last phone. it has to be one of my apps. the size is not as bad as one would suspect. it fits nicely in my hand. i do have to use two hands, but that also eliminates the temptation to reply/text while driving. a little annoyed by the flipping of the power outlet to the opposite direction of every other port that i've had on my phones since 2012 (logo to the back). it will suddely crash, especially when you're using camera. i don't know why. fortunately, it works better recently. tips: i use it in china mainland .   good. i do not believe this is a new phone. although it came sealed, it appears to be refurbished: *the outside of the box (not the shipping box but the small box containing just the phone) has what appears to be a water stain with some sticky material covering most of the top. *the screen protector is in place but has a thick layer of lint, as if someone had wiped it with toilet paper and the tissue rubbed off on it. *there are dried green and brown blades of grass ( .  ) inside the box, some pieces about a centimeter long, but mostly finely broken up and stuck to the phone. this is a first for me . *there are small nicks and dings on the back of the phone. *suspiciously, there were white labels covering the factory stickers on the outside of the box and obscuring information about the particular model inside. i suppose it is new but that the motorola factory doubles as a barn. even if it were refurbished, it was not cleaned very well. on the bright side, it doesn't smell and seems to work okay .   been using my nexus 6 for about a month now. really great price at only 350 bucks and a great phone if you want something big. set up was crazy easy, i just popped in my sim from my old phone and it was good to go immediately. phone feels solidly built, it's big but actually feels thin with the way it curves in the back towards the sides and bottom. fits in my pocket much easier than i thought. runs super smooth so far, can get a little hot when playing games while charging. amoled screen really pops and is even nicer with some minor adjustments. dual front facing stereo speakers should be mandatory in every phone as they sound really great. battery life isn't anything amazing but it gets the job done and charges up remarkably fast. camera takes great pictures but taking videos is wobbly. cell reception is great, wifi is some of the best i have used in a phone and bluetooth seems to connect with flawlessly with my car and is much less finicky than my old iphone 4s, ipod and lumia 640 i used to use. best of all it's stock android so it looks really pretty without all the superfluous junk and it will get updates first and for a long time .   this phone is pretty nice! little bit harder to find features than galaxy but still awesome phone. love the big screen. wish the battery, service signal and wifi strength icons were easier to read. but the turbo charger for this phone alone is enough to buy it .   good. awesome phone .   the best phone i've ever used.i like it .   went from huawei ascend mate 2 to this recently. while i do enjoy the pure android experience i would trade the high pixel count for battery life any day. i have to get used to charging every night after being spoiled by the huawei which lasted two full days. if huawei could migrate to marshmallow or at least lollipop i would go back to it but for now last years flagship will do. a little bigger for me,and battery can't support more than 1 day~. amazing phone. big size but you get used to it in a week's time and then can't get back to smaller screen size. battery gets drained a bit too early but not too bad .   i don't even know where to start, i love everything about this phone. makes my old samsung galaxy s4 look and feel like a joke. excellent battery life, and i mean excellent. beautiful screen. quality dual speakers. impressive camera especially for a nexus. honestly, the nexus 6p doesn't even seem like its any better than the regular nexus 6. i use this phone with ting, it uses the t-mobile network and i couldn't be happier. with this phone i no longer feel like my iphone friends have way better phones ha! take that iphone .   works just like the nexus 5 i replaced, except screen bigger and a few minor system improvements. i love this phone .   wow, need i say more. the best price for this purchase is on amazon. i love this phone! check out all the feedback on tech magazines. soon to receive 6.0. i prefer this over the soon to be coming, 6p as the width size is greater. it arrived sealed and new as promised. wow .   this was a mistake, i didnt write that review was a friend of me. im sorry, the prodcut is perfect amazon is the best. excellent cellular phone. a phone that is beautiful, good, cheap, and with the quality of motorola .   this is my 1st google phone and i find it amazing. has no troubles to download the backup information it just do it by itself. a great phone, compatible with almost anything. the only issue i had to open it, was that i didn't wanted to cut the red label so i had to unstick it carefully. i higly recommend to buy a protector case to take care of this amazing phablet. big enough to read my books and with enough speed to run appa with no interference. tried with different companies and it works with everyone of them. although the battery lasts only for a day, the charing time is so reliable in 15~20 mins i have 50~60% of the battery which indeed can last for almost 5 hours talking and running apps like whatsapp, fallout shelter, google maps, surf through the web, etc. if you want a different phone with great capacities this is the one. the voice recognition its even better than my last motorola phone. you should really try this nexus 6 .   working with verizon, just transfer your card, get reception, no verizon or 3rd party apps, stock google, lollipop 5.1.1 .   ordered mine a few days ago from amazon but i'm sending it back for a few reasons: 1. there is a strange line mark on my screen from the middle of the screen to the top. it's not visible when you clean the screen, but when running the finger on the screen that portion of the screen immediately shows the scuff mark. looks like something heavy was placed on the screen for a while leaving a scuff. 2. when updating to 5.1.1 out of the box with nothing set, no apps downloaded, the phone rebooted and upon starting an error appeared "ui stopped working," which pretty turned the phone into a soft brick. no amount of restarting fixed it. 3. had to call customer service and they instructed me how to go into recovery mode, and clean the cache. didn't work. 4. called cs again, they instructed me how to restore the phone to factory default, took about 1.5 hours for the phone to complete. it stayed in an erase window for a very long time. 5. finally completed, and updated to android 6.0. a few hours later i noticed the scruff mark on the screen. 6. screen is very dim outside. 7. screen isn't as bright as my note 4. 8. system is light years ahead of anything else out there. very fast and responsive it's a great phone. worked very well, but i'm definitely not keeping a lemon .   what is there to say .  one heck of phone/mini tab .   it works flawless .  i immediately upgraded to 5.1 and again couldn't be more impressed and jumping for joy  .   i had bought this worried i would have trouble activating it on verizon, but i had no issue. i just took it to a store and the activated it with no drama. you may need to go to a verizon-verizon store, and not a reseller, though. i didn't have to have any imei white-listing or anything .  it just activated. the phone is really big, and i really like it. the screen is great, it's quite speedy, and it doesn't have any carrier garbage on it. i had heard the battery life wasn't so great, but it beats the galaxy s4 i had in normal use. it doesn't last nearly as long as my work iphone 5s on standby, but the iphone battery is only ok if you actually use it. the phone's design is really nice. it has the aluminum frame and a plastic back. it feels premium enough, maybe not apple-premium, but close enough. the software is pretty nice .  stock android beats the other manufacturer and carrier flavors hands down. plus, this phone will get updates quickly. the only con so far is screen brightness when outside. my galaxy oled screens did well here, but this oled really doesn't. it is a limited use case, though. as to size, i don't think you can go wrong on either, but i got 64gb so i could hold plenty of songs during travel .   just an awesome stock android phone, love it .   great phone. arrived a week late. but the phone is awesome. i used to have a samsung galaxy mega, the nexus is a little smaller, but the quality is excellent. just a better phone .   it's very good and i'm happy with it. ***yes this phone works on verizon right out of the box i bought a sim card cutter and cut my micro sim card down to a nano put it in and it got lte very fast once i turned it on i unlocked its bootloader and rooted it the first day i got it so i could tether like a mad man if you have any questions about unlocking boot loader or rooting send me a email juddlr@yahoo.com i will help you the phone is really that good i ordered my honey one :). although the performance is ok, the camera is not good .   nice phone at a very reasonable price .   good phone. huge but after a month of use i am used to it now. battery is beast. lasts longer than expected. a great phone. very good. good deal. it's a great phone. you won't regret buying. not too big at all. heard alot about issues with the camera but honestly its a great camera, even in low light. battery life is great. you can easily get a full day of use with heavy use .  even more if you play around with brightness etc. i'm a nexus fan .   this phone is amazing. i love the lack of carrier bloat wear. it works like a champ with verizon. the only down side to this phone is the lack of an led to notify of different alerts (texts, emails, facebook notifications, etc.) .   i love it. great product. exactly what was announced. if you are in korea remember that it can`t support lte-advance. this phone is not unblocked, disappointed. ordered this a couple weeks ago, it's fantastic. i have unlimited with verizon so this was definitely the best bang for buck new phone. it works 100% with verizon, i actually took the sim card out of my cracked note 33, cut it with scissors (online tutorial) plugged it in and it's been working fine ever since. only thing i miss from note 3 is the home button but i'm getting used to it. also since my last 3 phones were samsung, took a while to get used to power / volume buttons being lower. those are my only 2 "complaints" about the phone, but i am getting more accustomed to it by the day. for the price, it's a slam dunk. not the newest or fastest phone out there but it can keep up, for half of the price it was a no brainerd for me .   this is a really nice phone. i'm glad i bought it .   i helped a friend buy. terrible phone. returned same day i got it. it had a corrupted file and wouldn't update to 5.1.1. it also would randomly reboot, but only while texting. i'm going back to lg .   great, not near as hot as other reviews said. great speakers. plenty of memory. great sound quality. great price while on sale! no disappointments. t.holloway. a great product, it's the same that appears in the image .   at 349$ for the 32 gb, its a steal. early android updates and the always on feature from the moto x .   extremely nice phone. i thought it would take me a long time to get used to the size but i adjusted really quickly. battery is pretty good but not as good as advertised. its really dependent on your use. i am a relatively heavy user so it normally would last majorirty of the day for me. it has lasted the entire day for me in the past but its not the norm based on my usage. amazing. it's very good .   shipped well on time, great phone and with the discount it was a great deal. $350 even in 2015 is a total steal .   the phone is ok. i love it ;). phone is good but i have a problem with speakers and headphones port. for those who can handle the massive 6" screen size, this is the best phone you can get for the money. forget about all of the cons that others might point out, the biggest plus is that this is a nexus phone, so google directly supports it. marshmallow was available the day that google released it, and unlike other oem phones, has no carrier or oem bloatware. just pure android, updated faster than any other phones outside of the nexus line .   awesome phone. got it on sale, so quite worth the price. very reliable, smooth and performant. only downside for me was having to switch from a micro sim card to a nano sim card .   awesome phone but i still have to get used to having no removable battery, ir blaster or sd card slot ã’_ã“. the pros: 1- very good price for the features. 2- running google's stock android (can be a con if you like to be in control of your phone inside out). 3- sturdy build. 4- very good dual front speakers. the cons: 1- the phone is exceptionally large so unless you've held it in hand before think twice before buying. 2- the phone is fingerprint magnet on the back and the screen gets really oily. 3- the phone heats up quickly. 4- the screen is below average and the white on the screen has pinkish tint. 5- the camera is below average with a slight blur on most pictures, but it is snappy and quick. 6- running stock android which means minimal customization options and puts google involved in every single feature you use on the phone without leaving a choice to you. 7- the battery life is below average. you will need to charge your phone every 12 hours for less than average use. 8- internal speakers (phone calls) relatively low and hard to hear .   awesome. great product, delivery took shorter time than expected. a bit dissapointed with the phone heating up quickly when using it, and the fact that it gets really hot when charging .   good android phone from google .   very good. hope the battery will be keep good after some time .   getting the nexus 6 to work on t-mobile usa was as simple as inserting a sim. it activated immediately and has excellent rf performance in fringe areas, and held signal on band 12 where and iphone 6s+ would not. all t-mobile features worked except for native android visual voice mail (waiting for marshmallow), i had to download the t-mobile vvm app. wifi calling work seamlessly as well. simultaneous voice/data works fine if supported by the carrier (tmobile+att) best features of the phone are the clear screen (excellent for movies) and the dual forward facing speakers. the speakers are loud enough to listen to music while cycling 15-20 mph. audio quality through headphones is exceptionally good and will even power large headphones like the sennheiser hd650 which normally require an amplifier. performance is very fast with no hesitation even with multiple apps running. battery life is dependent on signal, and lasted 4-5 hours on full brightness running a gps app or about a 1-2 days under light use. the body is a bit slippery so i added a supcase which improved the feel while offering some protection and a screen protector. for a car mount the iottie easy view 2 is the only holder i found that fit w case (about 3.4 in wide). great machine. better price .   owned a samsung glaxay s4 on prepaid for a while until i smashed the screen, didn't like it enough to buy another one. i bought the nexus 6 and i love it .   way better then the glaxay .   quite frankly it's the best phone i've owned to this day .   good. nexus phones are amazing .   4 stars because the battery could be better .   really awesome phone. i read the software is the sole of a system, forget about the peripherals; and it is so true! the combo of being on android and having a motorola/google combo for my phone is perfect. the real beauty is you don't have to deal with any bloat or crapware from any provider. need a nano sim, so i got fosmon nano sim card cutter and it worked beautifully. truly no technical knowledge needed .   its our first original android os equipped smartphone, not like fake chinese mainland product. we enjoy its in time update, simplicity of google services very much. fortunately chinamobile namo sim card works well in it. wireless charging allows flexible charging schedule. we definitely love it, even broking sinking prc's surveillance to update google's service and access google play can be sweaty.thx god we still do it .   best phone ever, so far. :). i received the phone and the forward facing camera does not work but i don't feel like going with our a phone for two weeks so i'll deal with it. love this phone! got it on sale for $350 from amazon. yes it's big, but that's why i wanted it! the screen it clear and bright - and its easy to do the other 80% of things i use a smartphone for besides making calls. got the unicorn beetle supcase along with the yootech tempered glass screen protector and its a thing of beauty. oh and project fi as well. if you want a bigger screen, this is a great choice .   yes,its xt1103.it can work on china-telecom 4g .   good. i bought the 64 gb version based mainly on the positive reviews and also the specs. i paid $400 on amazon and so far i am enjoying this phone. the negative thing is the mobile data stops working whenever you make or receive a voice call. i am not sure whether this is a bug or if the phone is unable to do both voice call and mobile data. i love this .   shipped quicker that i expected. the phone updated to 5.1.1 lollipop right away. now waiting for marshmallow to install. the phone meets all my expectations! unfortunately it will be my daughter's phone. :-(. very fast phone, screen resolution is quad hd and it looks awesome, good battery life not great for the size but it has wireless charging and rapid charge. it's a big phone but the feel in hand is very good, it feels smaller but slippery so i recommend a case. i bought the spigen ultra hybrid, its cristal clear on the back with gray edge and it looks great. the best of all is stock android. if you are looking for a phablet at a great price this is hands down the one to buy .   this is my 2nd nexus 6 64gb from amazon. both of them have screen issues. the 1st one has a screen banding/vertical lines with bluish and yellowish tint from top and bottom. so i send that back and got my 2nd one again from amazon. this 2nd one has no vertical lines, but has some uneven screen tone visible on dark and light background on the screen. i might return this back or keep it. i'm not sure, but we'll see .   amazing phone. better than apple brand any day. rugged and reliable. a large screen with a respectable camera. kudos to nexus. product arrived on time and it was as expected .   small hand big phone. best phone i've ever had. ex: dropped phone and lost it. turns out someone ran it over with a bike and turned it in to the lost and found. i got it back with absolutely no damages except to the screen protector it came with. wasn't even in a case. name an iphone that survived that with no damages. item come in with surface not clean pricing kept dropping  .   great phone. i just wish there was a way to add more storage. i should have gotten a 64 gb instead. too bulky .   as described, fast shipping  .   awesome. love it. great phone - bright screen. first use - it seems oversized, but now all other phones look tiny. no lockups or slow downs -. awesome phone. bought 2 of these .   us version does work on verizon .   no problem what so ever activating .   good. defective battery. i don't dare use the camera as using it would drain battery percent rapidly. other than the battery being the reason as to why i want a refund or replacement. the phone itself is good looking but i was just an unlucky buyer that received a nexus with defects .   i'm a little bit in satisfy,. i really thought this cell phone would be too big for me, but after a few weeks it feels completely normal. very snappy, no complaints .   great price, and pure android experience. would be better if ota comes as fast as other nexus devices .   great phone. phone is awesome , the shipping was fast. i'm using the phone to write this review. i've noticed several problems with the phone 1. there was a line on the center of the screen which looked as if it broke at the center. after reboot, its fine and no line seen. this happened few times and due to this i got completely freaked out. 2. sometimes the phone freezes and i am not even able to switch it off, i have to wait till the phone drains and it ultimately gets switched off. 3. even though there is enough ram available, the transition of apps close and opening the apps, i have noticed significant lag. all these seems to be like software issues, but one of my friend's nexus 6 doesn't have all the above problems mentioned .   excellent,i buy 3 in black friday .   best deal every.  .  awesome very happy with it. excellent phone. shipped fine, received fine. the nexus 6 is everything you wish an android phone could be .   got the phone on time. sound and picture quality is good. update the os as soon you get it. i faced problem in using whatsapp , voice was very less on speaker for voice messages but after applying update, it worked fine . overall satisfied with the product .   great phone at good price .   this is truly an amazing phone. the expansive screen is ideal for gaming, media consumption and reading. while the size was initially off-putting, i got used to the phone within a week or so. now even the nexus 5 i used to use seems small and cramped. build quality is excellent and it feels good in the hand. call quality is also well above average and the camera is adequate. all in all, an excellent all around device .   great phone with great price .   before i ordered the device i checked the review on this phone. it was recommended by google for proj fi and ca do calling thru wifi. now i have this device and use it on the tmobile, which also have wifi calling as one of the partners of google on proj fi. it does not work on wifi calling at all. i called motorola since they sold the device and tmobile since they are the carrier to resolve my problem. i picked this device for the wifi calling and what a waste of money if i can not have this capability on the phone. it drains the battery so quick that i need to keep it plug while in the office. if i can have wifi calling i can give a higher rating .   the best phone i ever had. love it! using it on the project fi google network. phone fits me perfect. its ergonomic shape fits my hand like a glove. resolution and camera on par or better than apple iphone 6 .   the size is what i was looking for. i don't own a pc or a laptop, so a large screen is very desirable. the issue i had with the nexus 6 is that apps would just stop working, with a little message informing me of such without explanation and a few times the screen froze-up and would not respond to any prompts, not even the power button. i don't know if this behavior is common to the phone or if i just got a lemon, but i've had enough experience with bad phones to understand how frustrating it can be to try resolving the issue with tech-support, that i decided to just send the phone back and chalk it up to simply a bad experience. if an explanation for its behavior could be provided, i would be willing to try it again, but as is, i'm disappointed in motorola, especially because it was originally a $600 phone. maybe it's just the "pure android" experience that i'm disappointed with and would only prefer a slightly adulterated version, like my moto x2, which i find to be a completely enjoyable and satisfactory phone. maybe the nexus 6p will be more user-friendly, but if not, the moto x phones will be my preferred choice .   great deal for a great phone .   with great service from amazon.com .   battery backup is not up to the mark. the best .   so far so good with my nexus 6 .   pretty much what i expected. great value for the money .   great price for a nexus phone. finally i can enjoy monthly software updates without waiting for the carrier .   love this phone, it is everything i wanted. it is big with a six inch screen, but that is exactly how i wanted it. now i do not have to worry about hitting different letters when texting because of my fat fingers. the pure version of android is also a plus because do not have to worry about having unnecessary oem apps on my phone .   very good .   great phone. arrived on time, as expected. easy to setup. large screen; construction looks and feels solid. buttons are large enough and are logically placed. calls quality is very good. sound is loud and clear. cameras work well. performance is flawless (email, internet speed, apps speed) no complaints at all, so far. i just want to stress that the nexus 6 is a large phone, so if you have small hands you should explore other options as well .   i love my nexus 6 .   love the size .   the picture is great .   and the phone is fast .   best of all its a google phone :). the ultimate balance between software optimization and hardware. lag free and powerful with no bloatware. unlocked and ready for use on any gsm carrier .   the phone was ok, but after having premium smartphones, it lacked some of the niche features i was looking for, such as a fingerprint reader. and, the screen wasn't as good as my note 4. i did enjoy the pure android experience, but that even left some things to be desired .   amazing phone and really fast performance, i just hate the curved design .   perfect  .   delivery & packaging superb. the device exceeded my expectations in battery life, performance & features. this is my first 'big screen' phone so i'm still getting used to holding it, how it fits into my jeans pockets & so on. no regrets on this purchase, however .   great media phone. fast and reliable. great deal at the new price. this phone holds its own against the new nexuses and is cheaper. its a bit slippery, but i am used to the size and can't stand looking at normal phones again. battery lasts all day, camera is good, its fast, and everything works as it should. i recommend .   thanks amazon .   i am happy. great .   cant find anything better than this. unbeatable price, i got 64gb model for only $399. thanks amazon .   prefect. excellent. great phone completely brand new, i have used it for a week and i am in love with it .   best deal in town awesome phone period .   bought one of the used ones from amazon warehouse and activated it on sprint. works great. for sprint customers a few suggestions. call the international sprint service (best service in the world) and order a nano sim the same day you order the phone. make sure you get nano sim simglw426c item # 760494000114 - ask them to overnight the card (the card should come the same day as the phone). they are free from sprint. when you get your phone and sim card, call sprint to activate it. done. great phone for. the phone is great but my front camera does not work, already try with motorola support service but the problem persist. return the phone it's really complicated for me because i am not from usa, so this sucks :/. arrived before estimated date & everything is working as promised. i bought this for $349 but was also wanting to see what the new nexii can offer. so far, i say there's no reason to get the latest nexii (5x nice size but not as powerful, 6p great but costly). i am very pleased with this phone and what it offers. this is a great traveling phone as it supports world bands. here are my takes. pros: 1. day 1 updates .   already on marshmallow 6.0. 2. excellent speakers, dual front facing .   3. amoled display means black pixels is completely off thus saving battery. 4. price: $349 for a flagship phone .   mutual: 6" display is both a pro and a con. great to use but also too big to handle one-handed. cons: 1. nothing, maybe the sheer size of the device but it's roughly the size of note 5 / iphone 6s plus anyway. small phone users will take some times to get used to this but will eventually love it .   awesome looking phone, fast, beautiful screen, with all the power from motorola and google. beware because for some people it could be too big .   battery life has sucked, hard, and the screen's color production is not good. i love amoled, but this panel is just not high quality. i love the size, and stock android, but unfortunately i can't recommend this phone to most people .   i ordered the nexus 6 when amazon offered it at half price. there is no way i could afford the original price of $600! but at $360 i jumped at it. i was looking for a large 6" phone and this fits the bill. it is a pretty nice phone. i do miss a notification light, vibration as it turns on and it is slippery in the hand, minor things that i can do without. the screen is beautiful, bright and clear, the sound is fantastic, loud and not tinny as most phones are. it is pure google android which i like. very easy to operate. the battery life could be a bit better, but i do get a full day of heavy use. all in all a nice phone. nothing extraordinary but a nice phone. glad i bought it for the much lower cost. thank you amazon .   i've had it on the att network for about 4 days now. no issues with activation at my local att store. she did say, " oh we dont sell those, they are complicated ". yeah i know i said. thinking to myself, our culture is conditioned to buy things designed for old people and 2 year olds that dont need much brain power to use. aka iphones. ( bleh! ) anyway, my only complaint about the phone os is that it wont let me change the volume of txt msg independent of the ringer volume. hopefully this will be updated sometime. my screen boot up only says android. i know some people were complaining about att or something splashing on their screens, but this one did not. however i turned it on and completed the setup prior to going to the att store. maybe this is the trick to preventing the att logo .   great phone for the price. the new one is out now, but i will be sticking with this one. it does everything i need and i don't see any reason to upgrade quite yet unless you need the latest and greatest every year .   i am very pleased with this phone. i am on t-mobile, so just inserted sim and the phone was ready to go. have owned the phone since oct 2015. i really like that the device receives regular updates to android, unlike previous and current samsung devices i own. here are my pros and cons. pros: 1. good battery life. 2. excellent speakers. 3. love the display (the phone is not too big). 4. not loaded with bloatware like my previous samsung. cons: 1. the battery is not designed to be user changeable, some of us like to keep a phone for more than two years. five stars if you could. 2. screen protector not pre installed. i suck at installing them. good thing wife is an expert at it .   good one. easy to use and i like the option of adding my own apps. much less junk to clutter up the memory & opporation of the phone. nice size too. 2 of my coworkers asked about the phone & also liked it .   yes the phone is big.but honestly for the price and the fact that is stock android is worth every single penny. very fast processor,nice clear colors,great stereo speakers and with the motorola charger it does not take hours to get a full charge. if you are an android fan,this is your daddy. no bloat wear from phone carriers just pure google android lollipop. it works great .   contrary to the description the phone does work on verizon. removed the sim card from my moto x and installed in the nexus 6. works like a champ .   i miss earphone  .   i love the os of naked android and the screen is large and very vibrant. the speakers are loud and clear. this phone is a easy 5/5 but the camera crashing constatnly makes the camera unusable. theu camera takes nice clear pictures but the crashing issue keeps it from being a perfect phone for me. it's a lovely device and i use it as a backup phone when i come home. it is substantial in the hand but that really just makes me like the nexus 6 even more. it's smooth and it has all the goodness of stock android good or bad. the battery life is just ok, i expect this to be improved when android m. overall you can't go wrong with this device even with the nexus 6p on his way out i feel like this is worth the price tag for what you are getting. i also enjoy the amoled screen on this device though it's a bit dim outside compared to my other phone. if you have the money and enjoy larger phones i say jump on it you won't even. also i love wireless charging as well .   i have been using my unlocked nexus 6 on verizon for over a month now. this is by far my favorite smartphone i have ever owned, & i have owned a lot. since this phone has gone on sale i think it is the best value for high and smartphone. you will not be disappointed with this phone if you love to tinker with android. this week this phone should be receiving android 6.0 marshmallow .   amazing phone. it's massive, but you get used to the size very quickly. the 1440p amoled screen is almost unbelievably clear. the fact that it runs stock android 5.1.1 (at time of writing) is a huge plus. the battery life is fantastic. even when on near max brightness and using the phone on-and-off all day, i can come home with 30%+ battery remaining. it runs every game i've tried at a smooth seemingly 60+ fps. highly recommended phone, for $350 it is a steal, blowing away phones prices over 2x as high .   while this is certainly an excellent phone, with a beautiful 2560x1440 display, good camera, and surprisingly comfortable for it's colossal size, i had several issues with mine, which ultimately caused me to return the phone. first, the top speaker hisses/crackles, particularly when the battery is low. this was very noticeable on my particular device, and even affected call quality. to me, this was unacceptable for a $400 device (i had the 64gb model) second, the battery life was very poor, in my experience. i had bluetooth off, brightness set to approximately half, with adaptive brightness enabled, and was pushing two email accounts to the phone. on a typical day, this type of usage would net me approximately 8-9 hours of standby with 2 hrs of screen-on time. this phone had me constantly tethered to a charger during long periods of movie-watching. third, i had issues with the touchscreen responsiveness. certain areas of the screen were more responsive than others, which led to some frustration, particularly when marking up pdf documents for grad school classes. so, now for the good: 1. camera takes excellent pictures, even in low light where digital noise performance was impressive 2. before encountering the speaker hiss issue, the stereo front-facing speakers were impressive for a smartphone speaker. though there wasn't a lot of bass, this is to be expected on a device this small. 3. qualcomm quickcharge 2.0 is simply incredible. i could get a full charge on the 3220mah battery in less than 90 minutes. having this capability was invaluable several times due to the short battery life i experienced 4. the display is simply the best i have seen on any smartphone to date. (my personal opinion, not necessarily 100% correct.) if you are used to the highly-saturated and contrasty images such as those displayed on samsung smartphones, you may be disappointed. however, colors are still displayed evenly and naturally, the display, especially text is razor-sharp and just a joy to look at. i really wanted this phone to work well, and loved so many features of the phone. i may have just gotten a lemon, but the speaker hiss and battery drain issues are common problems with this phone .   perfect. fantastic .   with the new model out, this model fell to a price point where i felt comfortable enough to buy it. it's been a week, and i'm very happy with the phone. the slim edges made it a little hard to handle; a small issue that was easily fixed by adding a supcase. the combination actually made it fit my delta cycle bike mount xl much better too! blazing lte speeds, loud dual front firing speakers, strikingly rich quad hd screen, qi wireless charging (which has been dropped on the new model) and turbo charging .   i honestly doubt that the average joe would really need anything better or newer. at a price that's way lower than an equivalent but smaller sized unlocked phone with less memory, and considering this was the flagship phone for google just last year, i think this is a no-brainer .   i love this phone! i got it a few weeks ago and it is so much better than my galaxy s4. it runs android very smoothly and the screen size is amazing. i had to get used to it but having a 6 inch screen makes it so much easier to type emails and see apps. i am very glad i got this phone and would recommend it to anyone who is looking and trying to figure out what kind of phone they want. also love how fast the charging is with the charger it comes with. it can be very low on battery and charge up to full in less than 2 hours. i have not yet tried wireless charging with it but the charger it comes with is so great, i do not know if i will need it. so far, it is an amazing phone .   at the price of $349, nexus 6 is marvelous .   arrived on time. its a grwat phone, and for 350$ it just amazing. i love the screen. watching youtube videos on it is great. i feel very comfortable with phone size. i had note 3 previously with 5.7 screen, but i can say that 6" is not that bigger. the only problem with this phone is battery life. dont get me wrong, it gets my through the day, but it definitely not that good how it was on note 3. and fast charge help a lot. hope in android m it will be fixed .   i've owned the nexus 4, 5, 6 and 7. the nexus 6 is definitely an outlier out of the bunch. the nexus 4 and 5 both gave the feeling that i was using an inexpensive, but loaded device. the nexus 6 does not feel like that at all. it feels like a premium phone. the camera is substantially better than the nexus 5 camera, though it doesn't hold a candle to some of the other flagship phones out there. i can say that what it lacks in the camera department it amply makes up for with the strong processor, large screen and 3gb of ram. if you can get used to the large screen size, you'll almost be disappointed to move back to a 5" screen like the nexus 5 .   i really tried to like this phone. it has some very solid things going for it -- that huge screen, the lightning quick processor, and a relatively big cache of memory. but the negatives are just too much to ignore. first off, this phone might be the closest thing android has to an iphone. if you like that idea, more power to you. i miss being able to add my own ringtones. there's more to it than that, but that's the most glaring example. the days of tweaking and configuring are over, at least with the nexus 6. the curved back of the phone is elegant, but it also makes it impossible set the phone down and use it, unless you're using it to play spin the bottle, because it's great at that. the ergonomics are just terrible. that slick back makes the phone practically suicidal -- it almost leaps out of your hand every chance it gets. unless my phone is defective, anyone that says the battery life is adequate is a casual user, and anyone that says it's good is an outright liar. i can kill the battery, from full to 10% (which triggers a shutdown) in just over four hours. four hours. seriously. and speaking of batteries, why is everyone going to those horrible non-removable jobs? it makes the phone a lot less useful when it shuts down and you can't just swap in a new one. also, no memory card slot. for the love of god, why? even 64gb, which is pretty good, starts to feel small when that's all you'll ever get. i miss my note 3 .   we ended up returning this phone, but not because of the phone itself, but because for whatever reason it was terrible on verizon's network. and it's not a sim card issue or anything. we had no issues with our other phone, but put the sim card in the nexus 6 and the signal just was not as good. no clue why. we did all the usual updates, just didn't want to work well. the phone itself was really nice .   this phone is definitely brand spanking new out of the box, it started with android 5.0 and i had to install all the updates in order to get it to 5.1.1 and now the phone is buttery smooth, don't hesitate to buy it, if you do like it you will not be disappointed .   while this nexus 6 is advertised as unlocked, mine arrived locked! since i know what to do about that, it was not a serious issue. if you don't have the skills, or software, to unlock the phone, double check everything when you first turn the phone on. otherwise, this phone is an excellent product. i bought this one for my wife. i had paid full price for mine, so the reduced cost was a super plus. we are now both on google's project fi. the nexus 6 was required for that service. because it's motorola, it will last for a very long time .   pros: performance, screen, price, appearance. disadvantages: sound, camera. in "google" always get a pretty good smartphones and tablets by pure android on board, so price for such characteristics. nexus 6 is no exception. undoubtedly, the main advantage is its performance here on the board quite a powerful qualcomm snapdragon processor with a frequency of 805 mhz, 2700, the new adreno 420 video processor and 3 gb of ram. the screen resolution is quite large, the picture is very juicy. a bit pumped up the sound from the speakers, it is not as loud and big as we would like. camera - 4-no much outstanding performance has not. battery - a double edged sword, has a short battery life, but charged very quickly .   great phone for the price! timely updates, beautiful screen, great front facing speakers, decent camera, and speedy smooth experience. i see no reason for you to not buy it! the battery isn't as great as some options but android marshmallow has a few features to improve it including doze mode. get it because m is about to release, you will get it first and it will improve an already great phone and fix it's only issue. this phone is not to big .   it felt nice in my hand and made viewing all media the best experience on a smart phone i have had thus far .   pro 1. stock android (if you like that). 2. screen looks stunning. 3. very well built. 4. nexus phones are easily rooted. con 1. screen has a pinkish shade when brightness is turned down. 2. the battery life of this phone is sub-par. it has a 3000ish mah battery, but i usually get only 3 hours of screen time from it. 3. low light pictures and videos are not good. there are alot of statics .   this is the best android phone i have ever used, no bloatware at all. so nice. got my new phone 3 weeks with the intention of testing it out and returning it if it didn't pan out. well after some hiccups when i first got it that were rectified by installing the latest version of lollipop ( removed my cricket wireless sim card and did a factory reinstall to update) this phone is great .   i just got my phone on monday. it is super fast and very large which is what i like. it does everything that i want and then some. lots of room and lots of fun. easy to use i just love this phone. the graphics and sound quality are just amazing. gaming is much faster and much better for you get more out of it .   purchase nexus 6 as a replacement to samsung galaxy s4 google play edition. i love it! fast and great battery life. fast charge is a must .   i love it. work very well. yes, it's pretty big. yes, it requires two hands to run it most of the time. but the screen is brilliant, it's fast, it almost always carries the latest updates and os, the battery lasts a long time, it's pretty intuitive to use, the sound quality is acceptable, as are the cameras. i'm using mine with google project fi and i'm loving it .   have had the phone for less than 5 days and has already frozen up 3 times. had very few apps loaded. also, it is pretty large for a smaller hand. the camera took nice pictures and the dual speakers are great .   i have owned a nexus 5 for 2 years and have liked it very much. i don't really have many complaints other than it shouldn't be freezing up as it is brand new .   all ok .   it is a good phone for 399.99 even though new nexus 6p is released.i think motorola is better than huawei .   the good: -excellent battery life -nice, big, excellent quality screen -very fast the bad: -reboots by itself. this seems to be a very common problem with these devices - they tend to reboot for many different reasons and you will find many different solutions which may or may not work for you. -it's just too big. real awkward to have in your pocket. i'd return it if it weren't for it being the only phone supported by project fi mine has a hardware problem where it reboots by itself whenever it goes to sleep/triggers some sort of sleep mode when it is unplugged. others have reboot problems too, but not to this degree. doesn't happen 100% consistently, but once it starts, it doesn't stop until it is plugged into a power source. i was trying to troubleshoot the problem by recording its logs using alogrec from google play to see what is logged prior to a reboot; however, the simple act of having it running saving logs to the sdcard results in this full sleep mode never being activated, and therefore the bug+reboot does not occur. leaving alogrec running does not adversely affect battery life, perhaps 10% per day. try that if you're having issues and none of the existing solutions seem to work .   it is quite disappointing when i found out that my nexus 6 is unstable and it will auto reboot intermittently. plus, i've only used it for less than a week and the return shipping fees is cost me a$112, which is horrible expensive! i think i made a wrong decision on buying this phone. it's utterly disappointed .   i have a xperia z ultra 6.44 inch phone which served me well until the charging/micro usb port quit charging the phone. i then bought a 5.5 inch oneplus one phone, which is fantastic, but wanted big. i mean really big, this nexus 6 is big, but i still may get a p8 max. there is nothing i can say bad about the nexus 6, i ran atutu benchmarks and my oneplus one and the nexus 6 were pretty much identical, if i can remember right both scored around 49500-50000. size wise, even though the nexus 6 is bigger, its not that much bigger than the oneplus one. the nexus 6 qhd screen is very nice, qhd videos on youtube almost look 3d. the nexus 6 speakers sound very good and are in stereo which is a rare thing in phones now and have no distortion at full volume. touch smoothness seems to be the best of any phone i have had when playing games. one crazy good feature is you can select what notifications you want which is beyond great. i am the on call person at work, i can turn off everything except phone calls so i don't get woke up when receiving a email etc, it also let's you pick if you want only certain contacts to be able to get through. battery life is adequate and on par with phone this size, but the quick charge makes this better since i can use the phone all night and quick charge it for a 1/2 hour and get through the rest of the day. only reason i wouldn't keep it, is size. i like huge phones, more like tablets, just a personal preference. update: i have had the nexus 6 now long enough to really use the phone and i am very happy with it. i have never had a freeze up or shut down for no reason issue, that pretty much all my android phones in past have had. being a nexus, is odd its 11/18 today and i still don't have the marshmallow update. i'm trying to think of any bad points to this phone, but is very hard to find faults. only bad thing i can think of, is when battery gets low, below 15% warning, there is a point where phone just shuts off, no warning after the 15% before it shuts down. so a few times it shut off on me and once back on a charger can take up to 15 minutes before phone will be able to come back on. at first i wanted huge, this phone is growing on me and the 6 inch screen size is nice, fits in my shirt pocket and takes great pictures .   horrible experience .   i ordered this phone for myself as an early birthday present was so exited to get it it took the prime 2 day shipping. i opened the box and there it was the huge nexus 6 box along with a tempered glass protector and a clear spigen case. got the protector on the phone no problem and the case was a perfect fit. setting up my simcard was easy i power up the phone the screen is beautiful i go thru the google set up update all the apps set up my 7 email accounts everything was going perfect. then the device reboots .   i used to fix phones so 1 reboot wasnt the end of the world i thought. reboot,reboot,reboot,reboot,reboot the reboots wont stop .   what a letdown. i contacted amazon for a replacement but since i did not purchase this with a credit card they couldnt process the replacement. they suggested i return the device wait for my refund 7-10 days after they receive the device then reorder it again. for a flagship device the software problems are unacceptable and so was the solution by amazon you have lost a customer after more than 10 years of shopping here .   this is probably one of the best deals on an unlocked phone right now. just buy it. yes, its huge. but thats a good thing. it's a really great phone. i give it 5 stars .   simply amazing. i love this phone. it is replacing my lg optimus pro and i wanted a phablet that is reasonably priced. only miss is the lack of a silent feature but vibration is not a big deal for me. while it's a great phone full of top-notch features, i made the switch from overpriced verizon wireless to t-mobile to save money, take advantage of gobs of data at crazy low cost, and take my chances that the network will continue to improve based on their dramatically increasing market share. but hold the phone, kids, things are not all as they seem. no amount of youtube troubleshooting videos, android central user forum posts, not even my sons who campaigned long and hard in an effort to get me and dear ol' dad to bail on verizon, could have prepared me for the disappointment (nay, ignorance?) when i tried time and again to enable wifi calling, to no avail. granted, the ad here on amazon.com doesn't appear to mislead, but the marketing geniuses at t-mobile are going to hear from me about the lack of any mention of a difference between the device they and others sell bearing the motorola dimple and signature nexus logo on the flipside. does the cost-conscious yet marginally savvy user going to understand the importance of a build number, which translates to wifi calling or not? unlikely. or am i the only one? maybe so, considering the lack of mention on the t-mobile support pages. or is someone keeping it quiet for a reason? i wonder .   i love the phone, it works great, but only problem is battery doesn't last long. even if i am not using it, battery still drained almost all the way. so i have to charge my phone twice a day .   this thing is absolutely incredible. brilliant screen, great battery life, and blazing fast performance. i have huge hands and this is the first phone i've found that doesn't feel like a toy. the price is perfect for this, especially considering that it's unlocked. i have it working on verizon no problem. just moved my old sim from my htc one m8 into this and gave verizon a quick call to give them the new numbers. had it up and running in about 10 minutes .   everything from this phone is flawless. performance is great, haven't had any problem. camera haven't tested yet but that is not my main focus when buying a cellphone. lollipop is super fun and well designed although i would have like better a bit more customization in the app drawer (don't want to install a custom launcher for that) screen is as sharp as it gets, won't be dissapointed. size may be a bit huge, but that's the reason i bought it, to have a big screen for productivity and .   i read a lot of ebooks making a sharp and big screen a must for me. (play books is awesome and i can even add my own epub files and have them on the cloud for any device) sound is a lot more powerful than galaxy s3 and galaxy tab 2 7" that i had before. just for comparisson though, i can hear music clearly while in the shower :) everything works outside the box. only complaint is the back cover is plastic and it gets some fingerprints, isn't a deal breaker since i cleaned it and put the phone in a case .   wonderful phone, although a bit to big for my liking. using it in one hand is definitely cumbersome .   love this phone, but the camera on it is not as good as what i've had with the lg3 or the note3 & 5 hopefully the nexus 6p will have a better cam. i got this beautiful phone last week and i have to say, this is by far the best phone i have purchased to date. i am coming from an xperia z1 so this was a big upgrade for me. i was going to wait for the nexus 6p but seeing that it has a usb c port was a main turn off for me, and also the fact that huawei made the new phone which made me question the quality and durability of the new device (i'm not just claiming this, i've had not so good experiences in the past with huwawei). so i decided to pull the trigger and i got the 64gb for $399. this is one of the best deals out there for any device, and i could finally say nexus 6 is the best bang for buck on any current phone on the market (and nexus phones should stay that way). here are the +ves of this device: + beautiful qhd amoled screen that i believe is better looking than ips screens, and i can honestly tell the difference between qhd and fhd especially with this screen size. a very important note here is to turn off the adaptive brightness as the screen just simply looks awful with it on, with a noticeable pink hue that ruins everything. turning the adaptive brightness off should be the first thing you do when you turn on your device. +snapdragon 805 with 3gb of ram is noticeably faster than 800 with 2gb of ram. i can finally switch easily between tabs without having to worry about the tabs being closed every time i switch. i can't wait to see how this phone performs with android m update that's coming in few days. +size is perfect for me, at first i was a bit sceptical about one handed use, but the more i use it the more i got adjusted and i really don't think i can go back to using 5 inch phones any more. +battery life is decent, it's not mind blowing but a step up from my previous phone the xperia z1. i do wish motorola included a bigger battery since this is quite a big hefty phone, but overall i am satisfied with what i have. +the speakers on this thing is the best i've seen on any portable device. it's not just the volume but the quality of sound, these are some seriously good speakers that will definately meet your demand for multimedia, gaming and entertainment. +64gb emmc i believe is enough to use the phone for the next 2 to 3 years. i'm really not a big fan of micro sd since they are slower than internal memory, and you can't install some apps on your micro sd (something i struggled with my xperia z1 that only had 16gb internal storage). i honestly think all devices should head in this direction, and ditch micro sd since we have cloud storage now. +the craftsmanship of this device is supreme, this does not feel like something you would get for less than $800. it feels very well made and premium, not too many people care about this particular aspect in phones (that's why so many people buy 'plastickish' sumsung and not many buy premium quality sony phones) nevertheless i see it as one of the most important aspects of a phone next to user experience. + stock android is hands down the best version of android out there, i really don't understand why would some companies use a lame customised skin rather than stock. i've seen some very awkward android skins and this is way superior than any other android phone out there, i just don't get it. ********** as for the -ves - the edges are slightly sharper and narrower than i would've liked. i'll probably forget about it, but i just hope motorola would adjust this small issue in future devices. -a bit slippery at times, just be careful not to use this device at risky places, like in the bathroom. -the vibration while typing isn't very satisfying. this is not a fault or anything, everything works fine, but just the vibration feeling isn't that of quality. i bought this phone with one thing in my mind : this is the best phone on the planet right now, and make no mistake after 1 week of using this gorgeous device i believe my claim to be true. pull the trigger my friend and get this device, you will not regret it .   currently still using this phone. easily one of the best android phones. love the constant instant updates from google. battery life seems to be acceptable with the amount of usage. (about 5-6 hours of screen time). otherwise no freezes, smooth, great screen .   great phone but the negative reviews regarding the battery are accurate. with moderate use, it will not hold a charge for the entire day .   **update - the crackling sound from headset keeps happening during calls. its random but i've noticed at least 4-5 times in last one week. once started, i've to restart the phone. i'm sending it back to amazon for a replacement, as mentioned below, everything else worked like a charm. ************** i liked this phone a lot. there are some negative remarks about the size but believe me once you are used to it (1-2 days), you will never go back to a smaller device. the screen looks amazing and the phone is very fast. however, last couple of days, i've been hearing a rattling noise from the speaker. it come while making calls even if its in handset mode. not sure if it is a hardware issue. i restarted once and it stopped happening but after a day it started again. its pretty random - once or twice a day and is very disturbing. i'll keep it for some more days to see if the issue re-appears. i'll share the feedback soon .   before i purchased this phone, i went to my local verizon store. i asked them to bring out a new nexus 6 and i verified a xt1103 model is the one they sell. i asked the associate if i purchased the phone on amazon if they would activate it. the associate confirmed they would. i then purchased the phone on amazon directly. when i took the phone to verizon they activated it seamlessly. my online account for verizon wireless shows my device as "nexus 6 non-vzw". verizon users follow my format and you will be fine .   this sale was a big hassle due to lacking info in description. this is the xt1103 phone and it will work with project fi. i just side loaded the fi image and scrapped the t-mo build .   they should put ir sensors on these .   good phone if you are ok with its monstrous size. screen is a bit washed out (google has not done a great job in calibrating the screen). sub par battery life (3-4 hours sot). ended up in returning mine since it has issues with the speakerphone (choppy voice while using the speaker phone). great phone, fast and with all the google updates .   the best screen on the nexus family, nice size, is really big, but is amazing phone. nice deliver .   a disclaimer: i am not a phone buff. i'm just a regular gal who needed a new phone. review possibly a bit biased in this phone's favor since i left behind a much, much worse phone. things for other regular joes and gals to know: - this phone has a smooth curved back. this means it's going to spin around in place a lot when you have it lying flat on tables. i'm thinking a case would help this. - i regularly get the phone turned upside down leading to problems remembering where the volume/power buttons are on the side. top and bottom aren't quickly distinguishable at a glance. minor annoyance, just means you might spend some time fumbling for buttons, especially when the aforementioned problem gets the phone spinning around. - space! and how! i'm installed all the apps i want and i laugh at how much space i've got left over. i came from a phone with like 2gb storage, though, so this feels like a mansion. - speaking of size, it is a huge phone. ladies, there's a good chance it won't fit in your front pockets; it doesn't fit in mine. it's not so large that you can't hold it though. - battery life is sufficient. i can play music on it throughout the workday without issues and make it home with ~25% charge (only on wifi, cell data will drain it to about 10% by the time i leave work). this is day two with the phone, more thoughts as i continue to use it. two weeks later update: i catch myself frequently saying that i love this phone. i do. it's a lovely phone. the size actually makes it that i'm using it in place of my laptop in some situations .   love my new phone. super fast and nice big screen. better then my s4 and my blu studio 6.0 hd by far. still in the learning stages of this phone but so far so good .   the phone is super cheap and super worth it. i think the reason it's cheap is because the newer nexus is coming out soon, but this phone is super responsive. i also have a galaxy s6, but i like this phone way better. the s6 lags a little but this phone has no lag and updates are always coming to improve it. it won't get outdated any time soon .   phone is awesome, but the reason for the 4 stars is that there is no wi-fi calling .   which is a feature that is available if purchased thru tmobile. where we live it's almost essential, so not having that feature meant a lot to us. if that's not important, it's a wonderful phone. screen is crystal clear and the calls are a lot crisper than the nexus 5. great phone, just missing one key feature for us .   beast of a phone that works on all carriers and is gorgeous to look at, read, type. my first android phone was a droid 2 global by motorola that i absolutely loved to death due to it's longevity, ruggedness and slide out keyboard for ease of typing. after it started to be come slow, sluggish and eventually crapped out on me. i thought i'd never go back to a motorola device but seeing this gorgeous phone last year i knew i wanted it. however i didn't want to buy it at the full 700+ dollar price tag and i was happy with my old phone at the time. but then i needed something knew and seeing the iphone 6+, i knew i wanted something big but not apple, since i'm pretty deep into android now. lets talk about the screen. it's absolutely massive and gorgeous to look at. it's a 5.96 diagonal amoled screen that screams beauty. and the best thing about amoled is that the blacks are very black, since the screen in that area is not on. this saves battery life which is very, very crucial for this phone. having this 2560x1440 resolution on a phone means very sharp, crystal clear pictures, messages, games, and movies but it does come at a cost of average battery life. i have my brightness setting at around 1/4 or 1/5 of the brightness bar. this, honestly, doesn't bother me much since i can still see everything on this screen well. it's still bright enough for me to read my messages in almost direct sunlight. i might have to rotate it towards me a bit, but i did that with my other phones. the little divot where the motorola symbol is helps tremendously in being able to cradle and hold this phone. i do have slightly larger than normal hands but i've always used my phones two handed for typing anyway and this is a lot better than having to squish my hands together to type. plus i can, with that divot, still use swype to type if i need too. audio quality is amazing on this thing. i came from another phone that revolutionized front facing speakers and loved it back then. these are honestly a lot better and a lot louder, and i keep the volume half way. this is coming from a guy who likes his music louder than normal and i feel like this phone is too loud. this phone supports every us carrier (the us model) and since most of the carriers now are doing away with contracts (and having you pretty much have a phone-loan now), buying this at it's 400 dollar price tag is a steal. if you're a die-hard android fan or like to tinker with phones, this is the one to get. there is a great group of devs and support for this phone. even with the new nexus devices right around the corner, i'm very glad that i bought last year's nexus 6. well worth it, just make sure you have a portable charger with you to help alleviate that slightly above average battery life .   using this on google fi. love the phone. for a year old phone it is blazing fast. i have not encountered any stutter at all. it browses the web faster than my dual core laptop .   great phone at a great price! don't be scared away by the size, but this phone is a beast in every positive sense of the word! great specs and great performance at an even better price! highly recommended .   from the g1 onwards i've had only nexii. this one doesn't disappoint. a bit huge for my taste. did not buy out of the gate due to the ridiculous price it had at the beginning. but now at $400, was a fairer deal. like all nexus cameras, not the best, but it does the job and i think it's the best so far from the nexus lineage. now the sound! the double frontal loud speakers sounds, er, "delicious" and it makes a real pleasure to play games or to watch anything on that screen. placement of buttons are where they need to be as this is a larger phone. clarity of calls is superb, i think the best of all nexii. person on the other side sounds right next to you. regarding battery, i was so afraid as i saw many reviews saying the worst about it. i am a heavy user, not of video or gaming, but rather of using it for reference, thus i'm opening and closing the phone constantly throughout the day. all ii can say is .   my fears were unfounded! if you like nexus, this one is a keeper .   works just fine on verizon. why pay $300 more .   amazing phone. i have been buying budget smartphones off amazon for a year now and they keep breaking. finally buy this flagship phone and it's amazing. specs are still in competition with this years flagships even though it's been out for a year. it's fast, fluid, powerful, and you can't beat the pure android experience. the animations and design are flawless. the phone itself is just exceptional. the display is bright, large, and insanely crystal clear. the build of the phone is beautiful. the back is smooth but grippy and with the small bezels on the front panel, it looks sleek and smooth all around. buy this phone. don't consider it. buy it .   item as described; recommend to all .   awesome phone all around .   no screen shot no wi fi calling the most dumdest f$#&ing phone i ever used i cursed the day i cursed the day i brought this phone. great phone at an incredible price. this is the best deal for an android phone that is unlocked to work on all the major carriers that you will find anywhere. all you need is a sim for your carrier and badabing you are in business. the major benefit to a nexus device is that you don't get all of the crap bloatware that phone manufacturers and carriers seem to think we all want or need. you also get the latest and greatest android software version long before any other phone on the market. this is my first nexus phone but if they can continue making a great device unlocked and bloat free i might be a customer for life. fyi for those on sprint you will need the following sim.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00oe78ks4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 or you can get from sprint .   very pleasant shopping experience! nexus6 battery life is very satisfied, but poor at low screen brightness when the color, of course, this is a problem amoledï¼. really a great phone, and thank you amazon for shipping to china. (to google: you still need lots of work to do on camera, big gap with apple isight). i could not be happier with a phone purchase. outstanding phone! arrived today and set up was a breeze. of course it took about 2 hours through all the updates, reboots, etc. yes, it is a 6 inch phone. it fits my hands and the weight is no strain. beautiful dark blue casing .  very premium feel. this phone is fast! i had an extra t-mobile nano sim to use and the set up with t-mo was fast and easy. i looked on the t-mo forums and amazon/google user posts and reviews before buying and i do agree with one hardware complaint, the phone gets warm, but not uncomfortably for me. the other big issue, resolved only recently it seems, is wi-fi calling on t-mo .  with the last update, wi-fi calling is finally working. other items to note, the first picture i took after the setup was of our garden and it was spectacular. both sending and receiving call quality is excellent. i've had the t-mo g1, mytouch, nexus 4, nexus 5, lumia 925, and now the nexus 6 (no iphones ever .  please!). i'm waiting for the lumia 950/950xl (folks, try a windows phone, they don't have as many apps but they are functional and fun as all get out), but in the meantime, the nexus 6 will do nicely. and the price? i waited almost a year but it was worth it. at $699, no way jose, but at $399, yowza! pros: premium feel premium look, midnight blue smooth back, aluminium dark silver blue sides fast initial setup fast t-mo set up excellent back facing camera sharp, bright display. 6 inch size fast processor. fast internet. web pages loaded quickly wi-fi calling is working with the last t-mo update fast charging latest (sep 2015) pure android os build (5.1.1) cons: does get warm while charging. great reception, signal strength is a lot more stronger than my last phone. powerful hardware, haven't had any lagging issue so far. large memory capacity comes in pretty handy .   great phone! very fast and has a really nice screen. nexus for life! has 4g lte for t-mobile and at&t .   everything about the phone was great as described. however, the biggest downfall was the battery life. it doesn't even last 8 hours. drains tremendously even on standby. the description says 24hours and more .   i only giving them three stars because i need to keep checking it, is too early to know how good it is .   great phone for the price .   i went from a potato to this phone. holy crap. such an impovement. lots of ram, quad core cpu. fantastic. even comes with its turbo charger. only weird thing is how long it takes for it to load. note: this phone will work for tracfones byop program .   ok. amazing phone. very fast and i love the front speakers. turbo charging kicked ass. love! this phone. huge google fan. sold my nexus 5 and got this one for the same price i paid for a 32 gig 5. love the price. can't beat it. i got the 64 gig. lightning fast and it was the us version not the international. if you have the 4 or 5. or a lesser type android, do your self a favor and buy this phone .   i am very happy with this item. this phone replaces my nexus 5 that 'died'. the nexus 6 is larger, has a better camera and front facing speakers for better sound. very happy to buy it now at $350 rather than the $650 intro price .   product was exactly as described. works good. thanks  .   so much better than my samsung galaxy note 3. love it so far. was an iphone user. can't beat the current price .   i'm iffy about this phone. my phone is my office, and truthfully, its not like i work that much. so far, i'm not completely satisfied with the handling of the phone. first off, the phone gets super hot when in high usage. i have a cover and still it gets uncomfortably hot when gaming or streaming video. this is especially annoying when the phone rings and i have to put it to my ear and its blazing hot. i thought my device was defected, but then saw many other customers complain about the same thing so now i think it's just what this phone does. second, i've had this phone a week now and its turned off 3 times on its own. i have to long press the power button to get it back, but then it takes forever to load up. third, and this may be more of an android issue, this "roller dex" window .  does it have an end? it's like it doesn't have a limit of windows that can be open. i find myself having 30+ windows open at a time sometimes and the phone starts bugging out. it starts freezing, giving me error messages when loading a web pages, etc .  so i have to continuously be on top of clearing and cleaning clutter in the phone. this is not too difficult in theory with all the amps. anyway, the point is, i thought i was getting a really great product at a bargain. instead, i think either this phone is defective, or its not as powerful as i thought it'd be. after a month, the feelings i reserve for this phone have not gotten any better .   this phone crashes constantly! sometimes it works as advertised, other times i want to smash it against the wall .   overall a decent phone on it's own. if you're migrating from the galaxy note series prepare to be underwhelmed .   love it. purchased this on amazon at the new low price of 349. i thought it would make a great alternative or back up to my iphone 6 plus. i removed my t-mobile sim card from the iphone and placed it in the nexus 6. after several system updates, i entered the correct t-mobile apn information and everything worked flawlessly including band 12. speed test downloads are hitting up to 60 mbps. this phone is fast and the display is beautiful. the bottom line is i'm loving stock android and this phone. the iphone is now my alternative and backup phone .   ***update*** few days in with the nexus 6, i am loving the phone in its supcase .   i am hating .   it's turbo charger .   i stopped using the turbo charger because it is an over glorified battery killing devil .   the turbo charger is a convenience when you are rushing out the door with a low battery and want that extra 20% of battery juice quickly, but the turbo charger is also a battery killer. heat .   will reduce the life of your battery. i am currently using yesteryears moto g 2014 charger with the nexus 6. i don't mind waiting 28 years to get a full charge because the moto g charger takes it's time to charge the battery and i'm glad .   because, there is no heat! and i'd rather have a phone with a good battery 28 years later than have a brick 5 minutes later. the moto g charger does not heat up the nexus 6 and i will continue to use it. heat is the greatest destroyer of phone batteries. if i'll ever use the turbo charger, it will be for 1 minute or 2 not more if ever. turbo charging is good but i also don't want to carry an electric cooking range for the convenience of turbo charging .   "heeoooo no .  " (sic) surprisingly huge .   i did not expect it to look so huge but coming from a moto g 2014 to a nexus 6, i have a lot to get used to. the phone is heavy, the screen is sharp and bright but comes across as warm so whites don't pop up as they did on the moto g. the 2nd gen moto g is a very nice phone, sans it's memory. the only thing that made me upgrade from the moto g 2014 was it's lack of memory. at 8gb storage and only 1gb system, i feel that motorola compromised what would have been a great phone for the ages. the moto g 2nd gen is an awesome phone. it's battery is stupendous! gorgeous screen! it just works. i just got tired of having to close apps just to stream my favorite radio shows on iheartradio and delete apps because of running low on storage. for the length of time i had the moto g, and for it's price i learned .   that in mobile devices, it is okay to be a fiscal conservative because, cellphones are the worst kind of investment to make and you surely get what you pay for. i also learned never to compromise on storage memory and espcially system memory. the nexus 6 is a giant phone, a tad smaller than a nexus 7. but it is a gorgeous device with good system and storage specifications. no longer do i have to worry about choppy audio because the system is running out of memory and no longer do i have to pick and choose what apps to keep and what to delete, just to save a few mb of storage space. no longer do i have to close one eye just to see what i am typing, thanks to the huge screen of the nexus 6 but i digress .  the moto g has a 5 inch screen so it is the perfect screen. the nexus 6 has 32gb storage, enough for what i need, and 3gb system ram. a qualcomm 805 chipset is an awesome jump from the 400 i had to endure on the moto g. i still feel the 400 is a capable chip especially when it comes to pure android but it suffered because it's memory was badly stifled. in today's day and age of advanced mobile software 16gb is no longer adequate storage. 1gb system ram is not viable. it is unfortunate. verily verily i say unto you, let them who have eyes read these words and understand .   i am very pleased with my giant phone the nexus 6. it is smooth, looks and feels great in the hand, sound is awesome. to be honest i just got the phone so time will tell, the only thing i have noticed that i do not like is the camera is not all that good. now, it dosen't look like a camera from the soyuz missions of the 1980s but it will get the job done for simple facebook photos and instagram but that's about it. nexus 6 is a great upgrade. i got the us unlocked version. lastly .  watch .   the model version you are buying. if you buy the international version, you will have some issues with lte networks in the us. if you want the us version make sure in the product description, the model number listed is 00630nartl. this is the xt1103 nexus 6. international nexus 6 is the xt1100. nexus 6 in truth and in spirit .  forever android fan .   i am happy to have the nexus 6 .   its amazing. great phone, bought it, to replace a moto x 2nd gen with a cracked screen, of the same design. worked wonders on the att network, and now that i'm using google fi, which uses both tmobile and sprint networks, i can say they to work without issue .   i love my new phone. but i am not a picky person with phones. it makes phone calls, great. it does texting to multiple people. i like that. had really hard time with my old phone because it did not. the camera seem good - another plus. it is quite large - a minus in my book. i liked the size of nexus 5. the battery lasts all day and then some. my old phone, with extra long battery, was gone by end of day - another plus. overall, i like it a lot .   very good cell phone. the camera is great. not as fast as i expected though .   so far so great. it is taking time to get used to lollipop 5.1. easy setup and nice looking. i was worried because many comments were made that you need two hands to use the phone. nope, that is not true. love it and love the price .   nice cell phone .   it's just perfect. very good product, very satisfied, is the price of other places is much lower. the first phone i got kept rebooting so i had to factory reset it. then there was a problem of the screen blacking out when i am on the phone and i cannot use it until the call ended. so i got a replacement. the replacement phone speaker had a lot of static. these are all within a week of using each phone. i ended up returning. this is way more problems than i want to deal with especially on a new phone .   awesome phone love it. the size was never the problem it was the $700 plus price. but since it was only $350 i jumped on it super fast .   i got so use to this 6inch phone that it makes my nexus 5 look like a baby screen .   anyways just buy it and you will be hooked :) (here is a pic with my nexus 5 & 6). attention: from brand new there are about 5 android updates (or more .  ). my phone frozen on the first one and had to do a safe mode reboot, then, it was fine on all others. before using the phone, do all the updates! i did the â€œbluetooth copyâ€ from another android phone and it was great, all passwords done and some app started to get installed. now, i donâ€™t recommend installing more apps until all the android updates are done because every time the system does and optimization of every app and itâ€™s a long process. â€¢ dislike: no led notification. * dislike: curved back. when placed on a flat screen its annoying that the phone moves left of right while touching the screen. â€¢ dislike: no one hand operation. explanation: i had an ascent mate 2 (6.1 inches) with and emu that provides an option for one hand operation such as, small left or right unlock screen which is very handy. no small screen option neither for one hand operation. either way, the ascent mate 2 was a little bit bigger so i'm ok operating the phone with one hand. â€¢ dislike: no themes for different icons with color match background. â€¢ dislike: screen/phone gets warm/hot with medium/heave use. â€¢ like a lot: great 5.1.1 android as of today and waiting for 6.0 marshmallow. â€¢ like: great front stereo speakers. * like: no start or power off sound (noise) â€¢ this phone is fast with ok google on google now launcher. while charging it the lock scree will show you an estimate time to 100% charge. look at the picture. â€¢ i like the â€œautomaticâ€ unlock options such as location (for home use) and bluetooth for the car and smart watch. â€¢ itâ€™s unconventional that the options screen it available from the lock screen, kind of a motherboard password update: not anymore after an update that change the scroll for the apps from left to right to up and down plus a search and most common apps used. i hope battery doesnâ€™t die within a year. at current price of $400 for 64gb its kind of a big deal. will not get worried about space at all. â€¢ donâ€™t forget to play the hidden game .   awesome phone for the reduce price. glad i waited and it was a giant upgrade to my nexus 5 (still an awesome phone!) .   google has a great phone here. the only draw back is the screen is very hard to read in bright sunlight. but not so much that i took away a star. i was an ihater that had to get an iphone due to older/forked droid phones being so bad and i am on call a lot. ended up liking it and getting another. after the 6 came out and not being impressed, i wanted a bigger screen with out the bigger price tag. security is a big concern so i am def not getting another bastardized phone again. google has a good back up and update system in place now. with this phone you dont have to worry about the vendor or the carrier suppressing important security updates. google account integration here is the biggest plus. i have had my domain hosted by google for 8? or 10? years. this phone is so seamless with the integration of everything it's very impressive. if you are leaving the iworld don't forget to unregister your phone number with imessage! and then any group messages you are on, those people will need to delete the thread and start over .   at $350, this is without a doubt a 5 star product. at it's original price of $650 when first release with all of the bugs lollipop had, it probably wasn't. either way, i've been very happy with the performance of this phone. battery life was what i would consider average, but after installing the 5.1.1 update it seems to have improved. the size, as most reviews state, definitely takes some getting used to, but the screen is very nice and a worthwhile trade-off. if you are coming from a samsung galaxy, or an lg g4, you probably won't be super impressed, but it is decent and hdr+ is fantastic. i'd definitely take a chance on it, you won't be disappointed .   i just got today 9/21/2015, but camera not working, how can i do .   best phone for the price. it really can't be beat .   unlocked device that works on pageplus/verizon mvnos/verizon, etc. as well as the usual companies like at&t & t-mobile or their mvnos. the back cover was lifting near the power button on one of the two i ordered (white model). i just placed a case on it and stopped worrying about it. it is an adhesive issue - motorola used cheap adhesive. just lift it off and re-apply a new adhesive. not such a big flaw that i'm going to be upset over it on an expensive device. i could easily have returned it through amazon, with their amazing customer service, but i didn't feel like waiting to get a new one in. this device is worth every penny, especially with it's reduced price here! you can't buy one used in mint condition from popular re-sale sites that i won't name on here! i haven't experience any overheating issues on either devices, and we are pretty intense on our wifi usage in our house. so, bottom line is that if you can get past some potentially bad adhesive, you won't be disappointed. 5 stars, no doubt .   i've had the phone for a couple of days now and i'm super impressed. the screen makes reading way more pleasurable than on my nexus 5 (5 inch screen) and the battery life is phenomenal. the battery had over 30% remaining after a full day of active use on the weekend, with the screen at full brightness and a live wallpaper running in the background all the time. also, i love that the screen activate when you pick the phone up, which was a great, unexpected feature .   size: i have small hands but i don't find the phone too big to use for me. it was just an adjustment .   i also think the phone is the perfect size for reading and using like a tablet, but not so big that it's too big to carry around for daily use. i had a nexus 7 for a tablet previously and while i loved the thing, it was a bit too big for my hands and i had to carry it in my bag or purse. this one still fits in my back pocket while i'm walking around, even in tight pants! screen: the resolution on the screen is amazing, definitely the best i've seen on a phone so far! like how the phone automatically adjusts the brightness based on how much light is in the room, it is also very easy to adjust yourself! youtube videos and pictures look very sharp and clear on the screen! sound: i love the two speakers on the phone. i especially like how they are on the front side of the phone rather than the back. it's like surround sound in your hand! sound can get very loud and always sounds pretty clear. battery: first of all, the charger than comes with this phone is awesome. it charges the phone insanely fast! the battery is pretty good on the phone as well. i use my phone a lot during the day for different purposes, i usually have bluetooth and gps turned on too, and it typically lasts until the late evening. even longer if i stay on wifi. if it is a day when i don't do much with it other than the occasional text and phone call the battery lasts until i'm ready to go to sleep for the night. i've had phones with longer battery life, but i don't think the battery life on this one is anything to complain about especially considering the size of the screen. camera: as a professional photographer i am always big about how the camera is on a phone. this one is amazing! the back facing camera is very sharp and clear, it also works great in low light. i like how the flash on the phone has two small lights on either side of the camera. the front facing camera is good as well, however it is not as clear as the back one, which is to be expected. i love the camera app to take pictures, it has panorama and sphere settings which is always a nice little bonus to have. i also love how the nexus 6 automatically backs your photos up to your google account. features: of course works great with all the good apps and products. a personal favorite of mine is that you can cast your home screen to chrome cast. which is great if you want to show someone a video on facebook, or have a music app that doesn't have the cast feature! i've had this phone for about three weeks now and i have no major complaints so far! also, for anyone that wants to know i use my phone with straight talk on at&t towers .   it arrived as scheduled in great condition box was great as well not tore up the phone runs amazing very satisfied with my purchase i came from an iphone 6 it is definitely a lot bigger but i was easily able to adapt to the size within a day of using it great battery life very user friendly. got the us model, which is what i wanted to use on t-mobile us. phone was delivered next day. started to receive updates once it hit the internet. 5.1.1 plus some other updates. works nicely. not the best browser experience. smoother on ios. great phone for the price. band 12 lte for t-mobile definitely seems to make a difference vs iphone 6 plus with band 12 support. battery life seems not so good, but that might be due to the very high res display. all in all, a great buy for the price and nice to not have typical android bloat from samsung or htc .   best battery life of any phone i've owned. i can leave the brightness on full, use wifi and bluetooth all day long, and still have some battery left at the end of a long day .   price was the main factor i purchased this phone. 6" is a little big but not too big compared to note series. and form factor is almost the same as an iphone 6 plus. - the downfall is, this is 32 bit processor, now android devices are moving towards 64 bit., this is something android took longer compared to iphones. - other is i would have loved if there was a microsd card tray. it gives convince to expand extra space and to manage those extra files where lightning speed is not too much crucial compared to internal space. - front facing two speakers give quality sound. too bad the package does not come along with an earphone, how much does that thing really cost google to add it to the package? - it came with os 5 lollipop, it asked me if i would like to update to 5.01, i said yes, it optimized for all default 126 apps, then another update 5.1, i said yes, same optimization again, another update 5.1.1, same thing again, and then another update, it was like never ending , why can't i just jump to one last final update automatically? androids are you listening? but overall experience is good for the price. i believe the price will go more down with the launch of the new nexus in a few days .   pros: 1. android 5.1.1 2. awesome screen and photos (if the camera app works) 3. good sound quality. cons: 1. phone getting really really warm/ hot even with normal use. yes, i am talking about no video streaming, no gps navigation and any such heavy cpu/gpu/memory intensive applications. 2. battery life : the battery drains really fast. i have switched from an iphone and is used to long battery life. this phone, i have to charge multiple times a day to get it going. 3. camera lag : the background photo processing takes for ever. sometimes, it takes up to 5 to 10 seconds for the camera app to come up .   upgraded from galaxy s4. much better battery life, screen, call quality and performance. after receiving the phone i checked imei number on verizon website and it was compatible with verizon network. had no issues activating it at verizon kiosk at bj's .   this is my first smartphone. i have a flip phone that works fine.i seen the $350 price at amazon and got it. i am amazed! it is blazing fast.the oled screen is incredible. since my old phone works so well, this will be my new tablet.it will replace my nexus 7 .   battery life was really disappoint. i have a nexus 5 (which i use for international trips) and an iphone 6 plus (used on at&t). both are far superior imho. amazon, as always, provided outstanding customer service .   this review is geared towards sprint customers and what to expect to get your new unlocked nexus 6 us cdma version activated. this phone will work with sprint but read this first! you may run into some roadblocks getting a sim card for this phone so call ahead and make sure they have them in stock prior to receiving this phone. you'll want to make sure they actually put their eyes and hands on the sim card prior to you making a trip to the store. i ended up wasting most of the day trying to get this phone activated due to more than one store telling me they had the sim card, then waiting my turn in line only to be told that they didn't have the sim card after all. special thanks paul at the leawood ks sprint store for excellent customer service and finally getting this day long ordeal resolved! the correct nano sim card for this phone is part number: simglw426c. (it is free and provided by sprint when you activate your new phone.) the sprint part number that they will use in store for the sim card is: 760494000114 also, make sure to take your box with you so they can scan all of the bar-codes. do not attempt to get this phone activated at a 3rd party store. make sure it's a corporate sprint store. (an actual sprint store and not some mall stand or a stand inside of another store) sprint will need to add the esn to the network prior to activating this phone but that was not a big deal. it took a little longer than a regular activation but it only took about 20 minutes once i made my way to a store where they actually knew what they were doing. so far the phone works as expected and no issues to report on the sprint network. i've had great battery life considering i've been messing with it non stop getting it set up the way i like. it charges lightning fast too. i'll update this review if i find it worth adding to the already numerous reviews but here are a few things i noticed on day 1. be prepared for several updates to the android o.s. and stay close to a fast wifi connection and let it charge. it needs to layer the updates and can't just update to the latest os in one shot. there are a few things i didn't expect with stock android 5.1.1 that left me a bit disappointed, but i'm still happy with the phone and like how fast it is without the bloatware. a couple of real bummers for me were the absence of slow motion video and group text messaging is gone from the messenger app in lollipop. the group messaging was easily resolved with a free 3rd party app. but as of this time, there is no viable solution for the lack of slow motion video which i used often at work. other than that, i haven't really found much that i can't resolve with a 3rd party app other than the limited vibration options. i will update further if anything else comes up .   best phone. the wireless charger is not worked in starbucks. the wifi is disconnected by itself offen .   no bloatware no bologna. the best phablet on the market. this device is very power hungry and can drain its battery while plugged into normal usb. you need the speed charger for it. i very happy with this purchase. i bought mine open box and it has the the most miniscule chip in the glass that surrounds the camera. other than that it was brand new .   love this phone .   it is big but love it .   motorola nexus 6 unlocked cellphone, 64gb, midnight blue (u.s. warranty) summary: yes, its a big phone. but its untouched android experience make it a strong daily performer. go try it hands-on in a store near you to get a feel for its size before you buy it. it gives you the freedom of going with any carrier which is a big plus. some of my observations that throw light on day-to-day usage experience/quirks are below: performance: i switched from a note 4 mainly due to the sluggish nature of samsung touchwiz. compared to that, the-now-one-year-old nexus 6, runs like a breeze. no more waiting for the graphics/animations to catch up like my note 4. everything just works out of the box! of course, you lose some features like the s-pen - but that is something i could live without in exchange for a zippy fast android phone like nexus 6. five stars here! amoled display: the screen is gorgeous. it may seem to boost up colors more than normal, but that should be ok for most folks. i love the way nexus 6 flashes the notification summary and the clock when you move or pick up the phone from a stand still. 5 stars. battery life: after using it for a week (moderate usage - work / personal emails, 50 messages, 10-15 calls averaging 4min each, about 30 minutes of browsing, 15 minutes of youtube, 40 minutes of bluetooth music), i would end up with ~30% battery by end of the day after work. this would take me up to bed time when i would charge it for the night. while the 3220mah battery is not a stellar performer, it gets that job done for me. 3.5 stars. size: this phone can seem like a behemoth depending on where you are coming from .   for me, it was just a little bigger than my note 4. so, i got used to it easily. i do like the huge 6" screen. it is very useful while watching videos and gaming. i am also able to see more content on emails without the need for scrolling, which is a big plus that i didn't see mentioned in many reviews. now, the downside of this phone is not the size but the material that makes up the back - it is very slippery. i find myself using this phone one-handed many times. for this, i have to use the phone's weight to balance it on my 4 fingers leaving my thumb to operate the phone. and depending on the area of screen i want to reach with my thumb, i will have to re-position my palm to give me that extra reach. so, if you are holding this phone at an angle, it will slip out of your four finger hold very easily. i wish the backing material had a little more grip to it. but, i can see people getting used to this gripping technique over a few weeks. 4 stars. button placement: the screen lock/power and volume controls are on the right side and placed towards the top half of the phone. what this stops you from doing is to hold the phone in landscape mode on one hand with your thumb supporting the side that has these buttons. due to the one-hand grip, i have ended up touching these buttons numerous times when i didn't intend to .   this is a little annoying at times, but you do get used to it. the buttons are very tactile and you do feel when you press it. 3 stars. curved back: this makes the phone not stay put on a flat surface. its very tough to operate with one finger when your huge nexus 6 is rotating around like crazy. only way around this is to hold the phone with some other fingers while trying to touch/type. 2 stars. dual front facing speakers: these make a world of a difference compared to the single back-facing speaker of note 4. the sound is just booming at 60% volume and its enjoyable! 5 stars .   there isn't much i can add to what's already been said, so i'm going to try to boil it down for ya. the experience: the nexus 6 is as nexus as it gets. clean interface, latest software, no bloat to bog down the phone, etc. etc. i've owned every nexus *phone* since the nexus one and each iteration has further refined the above concept. nexus just works. i wish the other android phones had the hardware/software ecosystem control the nexus program has enjoyed. most apps work flawlessly. the same can be said for most accessories. i have a lg watch urbane that just would not consistently pair with my oneplus one and now works flawlessly with my nexus 6. pros: - all day battery (i am a heavy user). - quick charge 2.0 (in case you need a quick top-off) - gorgeous screen - good sound - great deal at new price (399usd for 64gb) cons: - button placement. as many have complained, the power and volume buttons are way too close to each other. the power button is, however, textured for distinction. - f'n big. my oneplus one was the largest that fit in my hands comfortably for one handed use. i am constantly almost dropping this phone using it one handed because i simply can't. i'm not sure loss of one handed use is worth the extra 0.5" of screen. but, then again, boy is that screen gorgeous! ah well, can't have it all .   ;-p. fast, but quirky, camera sometimes failing to respond tweeting reboot. tooooo damn big, and honestly, why do they make the glass curve at the edges without any metal protection? if it drops the impact points are more likely to be on glass, therefore requiring to buy a bigger, bulkier case .   everything that i've used it for so far is as expected. the few downers are how quickly it heats up when running multimedia apps and not being able to connect with some wifi hotspots .   this is a thing of beauty. but you should get a good bumper case for it because it's rather slippery. i installed the t-mobile nano sim in the top slot, went online and activated the phone, and i was off to the races. it updated to android 5.01, then to 5.1, then to 5.1.1 which took some time. the phone's processor is fast, the 6" screen is crystal clear, and it operates flawlessly on my home's wi-fi. i'm very happy .   i was wary about buying this phone, but i needed to start my google project fi service quickly. now, after having the phone for a couple of weeks, i have found an additional traveling companion that serves me my multimedia flawlessly. just wish they would have put in a removable memory card option .   good. this is one of two nexus 6 phones i ordered. it turns out the display is damaged on this phone (due to heat) and will need warranty coverage. while the previous phones were covered under the cell phone company's universal coverage, warranty coverage here is a little more uncertain making this a cautionary buy .   jellybean .   i bought this phone on sale. the speaker of the first phone i got would make a clicking/popping noise when the vibrator spun. the noise was not a system noise, and would happen with the volume turned down/muted. the noise would occur mostly when texting/typing, however it could be heard when pressing the back button (or doing anything that made the phone vibrate) the only way to stop the noise was to turn off the phone vibrations. i called amazon and they sent me a replacement. the replacement makes the same noise. i'm on my second replacement, and it's still making the noise. when i call motorola, they tell me they've never heard of the issue, but i can send it in, and if they hear the noise, they'll replace it. or i can pay $25 to have it replaced without testing. this is unacceptable. i will never buy another motorola product again. this is supposed to be a flagship phone. it's a pile of crap. don't waste your money .   i'm unsure if i missed something in the description. but this nexus speakers are blown. and it has a european charger with it. also i can't get lte on t-mobile. i hope amazon corrects this .   very happy that i chose the nexus 6 so far. the enormous, beautiful screen is truly impressive for viewing text, images, and video. it is fast, responsive, and capable of performing whatever task i throw at it. pure android is much better than the modified versions from other manufacturers and soon android 6.0 marshmallow will be available for it. battery life is good - i have several draining apps running constantly and still gets me through the bulk of the day .   i picked the phone up last sunday and have been using it a week. it's definitely not as big as it was alluded to. i'm coming from a nexus 4 which was in a ballistic case which was kinda bulky. i put it in the supcase hybrid case as it was cheap and provides good protection without adding a lot of bulkiness. it's running on my pre-paid cricket wireless account and it works fine. all in all, i'm pleased with the phone .   ugh, this is a tough review for me. i love this phone. love, love, love it. i love the screen and the over size. motorola makes some really nice stuff. now the bad. i bought this to work on tmobile. while it does work, you aren't going to get lte. you also aren't going to get wifi calling. you're better off buying the phone from tmobile sadly .   activated on sprint online without an issue. great phone .   i was a bit weary, but couldn't pass up the $399 price. one word, beast .   nice screen, no bloats, little big for me, activated this unlocked phone on verizon without any issue and works great. was not the correct phone for usa, as advertised. however they return without much fighting, when i explained it was open box to begin with .   wow! my husband and i are huge google nerds and decided to upgrade to this since my husband's last nexus 4 decided to have horrible malfunction problems causing us to put that bad boy to bed. this was way larger then i expected. we actually received the case a day before the phone, placed my nexus 5 in the case and thought this has to be a mistake. i have seen people walking around talking of their tablet size cellphones and thought how annoying and excessive. i was totally wrong. the nexus 6 arrived and my daughter and i couldn't have been more excited. the box it came in was simple yet professional. the phone is large, i wish i could've kept it but i would have definitely started having carpal tunnel syndrome after a while. this is really a gorgeous phone. the clarity for pictures taken is amazing, the screen itself is ridiculously clear! hopefully, all of the defects that were mentioned by others have already been worked out. google customer service is so on point though, i am really not worried about if something were to happen to the phone, within warranty period, and not have it replaced or fixed .   to all the people slamming this phone, just got mine today, i have owned every nexus phone and this is my second nexus 6. these are not clearance type old models gathering dust. you can power on the phone volume down+ power then scroll to barcode to see manufacture date. mine is 8-22-2015. thats not even a month old. this is a great phone if you like big phones .   for 349 you will find nothing better without a contract. awesome phone .   coming from an iphone, i'm not a fan of this phone. i bought it for the "pure" android experience and the positive experience i've had with other motorola phones. however, this is not just bulky, it doesn't fit right in the hand. it's awkward to press the button and still use one-handed. basically, just doesn't feel right .   adding a case to this makes it even more awkward .   i purchased the nexus 6 after having continued issues with my samsung note (1). my note had reached its limit. i am on t-mobile and was having constant dropped calls, lost connections, etc. and i blame the phone more than i do the service provider. it was old, the usb charging had been replaced, and most of my issues started after that (i think the repair tech may have damaged the antenna). i've been using the nexus 6 for about three days. lightning fast compared to the note. a little faster than the blackberry passport i use for work (which is a great business phone in my opinion). it really works well the streaming data. and it makes calls and picks up signal better than the note. i don't drop calls any more. it holds a charge well, but i do find myself charging when i get home from work. but with the super fast charging, it's really no big deal. plug it in before dinner and it's got a nice bump in battery level after the dishes are done. while charging, the unit does tend to get very warm. i haven't seen the bulging back that has been mentioned elsewhere, though. the camera is decent enough. like the front camera for video chats. pictures are decent but the interface is a little clunky. i just have to get used to it. i love the fact that this did not contain any bloatware as delivered. so nice to be able to manage what i want on it. in general, i really love this device. i'm probably a low-end user. i don't play a ton of games or watch movies/tv on it. i just wanted something that would make good calls, give me fast browsing, and access to the latest stuff. and it delivers .   beautiful screen. the body is a fingerprint magnet. really fast and volume is decent. but when doing somethings the volume doesn't work properly. (liking posts on facebook, the first ring of a call and more.) also you will need a good case. the phone is really thin and slippery. biggest complaint. horrible battery life. and i know all of the tricks to conserve battery. i've had android phones since the g-1. update____________________________________ i got my replacement on tuesday. amazon was very polite and fast. but i may be returning it as well. battery life is dreadful. i used to own a cell phone store and i know all the tricks to preserve battery life. this phone really struggles. such a disappointment. i really like the phone. second update________________________________ the second unit suffers from even worse glitches. not very happy. this thing rocks my socks. it's awesome. screen a is little big, but it's more pocketable than you'd expect. if you like android and staying up with updates this is the phone for you. well designed. great price. you guys know what, this defective s*** can't even be turned on. google published a guide telling us to press button 15 seconds and wait for turning on. come on, it won't work no matter how long you do it. so disappointed by google mobile device. going for apple .   phone is fast with a beautiful screen and good battery life. i have very large hands, and this phone is on the upper limit of comfortable phone size, so your mileage may vary, but this has replaced my samsung galaxy, my tablet, and most of the functions of my laptop in one device. it is a little awkward to hold during phone calls, but i've had it for two days so i'm sure i will get used to it. the latest android seems faster, smoother, and more bug-free than my last phone. tldr: it's a really big phone, if that's what you want, you can't go wrong with this one .   best value for the money at $350. it is a huge phone, excellent screen and audio quality. camera takes great picture. connectivity is great, connects to wifi and cell data always at lte speed .   love the phone and the battery life. the only thing i don't like is that there is no sd card support. besides that it's a great deal and and an outstanding device .   all i can figure is this is the at&t version of the phone, which was released early to at&t alone. do your research before you buy this phone. mine had the problem that many have had, in that it would not connect to mobile data. i spent two hours on the phone with tech support, to no avail. i understand if you use sprint they may be able to fix the problem for you .   does this phone comes with a standard headset or not .   i am an apple person but took a chance on this phone. have not regretted the choice .   best phone i have had yet. last phone was a note 2 and a droid maxx before that. with the case on it is just as big as the iphone 6plus so if you are concerned about size don't let that keep you from getting this great phone .   the best android smart phone till now. i immediately purchased the nexus 6 after getting a note 5 from my carrier. i hated the note 5. this is pure google android. smooth, fast and feels really well-constructed. rooted this instantly after unpacking. lte works flawlessly in singapore, which is where i live. no case, no screen protector, no problems. the screen is not a fingerprint magnet. a super phone from motorola .   bad news - this phone is discontinued, a newer better model is about to be released, so its not actually on sale, they are trying to unload these. i returned mine because it does not work with metro pcs (a gsm carrier) owned by t-mobile even tho the description says it works with t-mobile. so don't buy this if you want to use metro pcs, and google never responded to my request for fi - poor service = i'd suggest not buying google products .   i didn't know this when i bought it but there is no notification light that alerts you to any sms, mms, email or phone call. you cannot re-arrange the apps in the order you like. they are automatically arranged in alphabetical order. you cannot remove the google search bar from the home screen. supposedly this phone has a turbo charge capability that is faster when plugged into ac. i used the oem charger that came in the box to charge my phone when it was at about 30%. it took a little over an hour to charge the phone to 100%. i think i read somewhere that this phone stated took about 16 minutes to bring it to a 75% capacity. one of the comments that i saw said that it was difficult to hold and use with one hand. not that my hands are huge but i can use just one hand to do anything on this phone. i do like the 6" display. it is a little bulkier than most phones and heavier .   phone is very good . if you are ok with its huge size . also i observed its get warmed up during charging and also in normal use like watching you tube etc. true luxury, these phones may spoil you for anything else. my second nexus 6 because i'm stocking up to keep these for years. expansive, glorious display, fast, responsive cpu and gorgeous, liquid gpu. this is the finest phone i have ever owned and truly replaces my pc/mac in every way - and travels in my pocket! don't need glasses to read the status bar and entire web pages display and if not, the lightning-fast cpu zooms in and out with nary a stutter. fits comfortably in my hand and can do 0ne-handed scrolling with little effort. the wireless qi charging spoils me for anything else, but in the rare times (once in 6 months) when i'm caught short on power, the motorola turbo charger tops off the battery fast. carries the full motorola us warranty, but not the google drive or play music bonuses. at this price, i was okay that:). simple to use and pure google experience is much better .   feels very big at first but you will get use to it. love this phone .   everything i could ask for. new nexus 6 at a great price. the phone is amazing. i ordered it for the fi project and it rocks. i would recommend to anyone .   one hour battery life. eight hour charging time. even after four hours of charging (and while it is still charging) it will not let you boot up .   too big in size for cell phone .   good value for money now. phone arrived in perfect condition as expected, new/unopened box. things i like: - big, beautiful screen. - stock android! - camera has produced some great quality shots! (see images) - fast! it doesn't even flinch moving from one app to another - dual, front-facing speakers sound good - 32 gb, enough storage for day-to-day use and several games i thought it would be uncomfortable because of the size but after a week's use i can safely say it's not. i thought 5.5" was my limit but after using this beauty i never want to go below 6" again. time will tell but so far this is shaping up to be my best investment yet, cell-phone wise. highly recommended .   i like nexus 6. good price. good quality .   it is good. i came from a oneplus one. this device is a slight upgrade in all areas, except maybe not the software part because my oneplus was running on cyanogmod, which is like vanilla android, but more customization potential. physical issues i see are the pink hue of screen on low brightness, can be removed if disabled adaptive brightness. i keep it on, doesn't really bother me. the back cover might lose its adhesiveness and start coming off. i'm not sure if you can replace the back and solve it diy but motorola support says warranty replacement is free .   bought this phone because i have a verizon unlimited data plan. i just popped my nano in to this bad boy and everything just works. as long a moto keeps up with its we work with all carries phone they will continue to get my money. side note love the unlocked bootloader .   this is a beast of a phone. for $400 for the 64 gig you won't find a better value. the screen is rather large but you adjust fast to it. the voice controls are some of the best i've seen at a phone. i put a cricket sim card in it and am very happy with the speeds i am getting ( $60 for 10 gig of lte makes my wallet happy also). this phone has all the top of the line specs you would expect with the exception of the fingerprint scanner. this is still an amazing phone and is worth way more than $400. flag ship phone on stock android. big, sharp, screen makes it easy to see things. keyboard much easier to use than my old galaxy s3. this is the model xt1103 which is a us model that runs on all four major carriers. it's unlocked so u can also use it on many low cost prepaid services also. phone is google project fi compatible. gr8 price $349.99 w/free shipping really makes this one of the best values on the market today. thanks amazon  .   phone came new and sealed in box with fast shipping. nexus 6 itself is pretty great. it's huge, but the display is absolutely gorgeous and there is a huge difference between it and my iphone 5s. it does get a little warm at times though, especially while using the included turbo charger (which is awesome, it charges the whole phone in around 80 minutes). ui is snappy, but there are the occasional hiccups. overall a good phone .   it is a good product, but it is not having wifi calling. so i am disappointed. i do not know, why this version does not have wifi calling. other than that it is goood .   just love the sheer size of the device, not very big for my hands ;) it performs admirably well and the sd805 is indeed a very capable cpu coupled with 3gb of ram, it can out perform some of the latest flagships, even those with a sd808, specially in graphics intensive apps and games. only thing i dislike, which might not be an major issue to complaint about, is the battery. it gets hot while charging, yet gets cooler by the time it's nearing a full charge ;) added to that, you have a nexus device, with a suoerb updating system from google ;). i am sold on never buying any other phone but the nexus. the lack of bloatware makes this phone extremely appealing. motorola's customer support was excellent as well when i dropped it from a third story building. highly recommend .   this is a very good phone and i've had all the good ones samsung, lg, htc, and this phone is as good as any of them even better if you like the look of stock android screen is awesome and i like that it immediately gets any google android updates and for $350 well worth the money. super disappointing after a great experience with the last nexus. freezes constantly, keyboard types when i am not typing, and phone volume is extremely low. bummed about this purchase in a big way .   i just got it and its big! since i never use one hand to navigate around any of my other cellphones over 5.0 i feel a good case will help me with my grip. that's the bad. i looked at the lg g4 i really liked the camera and camera app it came with. for me it was really a question of camera, size 5.5, and display qualities of one against the "video and music" experience, vanilla android and getting the updates quickly that made me go with the nexus 6. after receiving my nexus 6 i bought the paid app manual camera. what a great experience using the wheel to change the variables manually. amazon prime preset music play lists were awesome as well as video from other content rich providers (youtube, watchespn, netflix) etc. i down loaded the nexus media importer app since i have the usb otg cables to use either with my "flash drives" or "sd card/usb drive" with the nexus 6. battery life is as expected so with a fast charger and one portable qualcomm 2.0 charger to boot i decided to let the pedal to the metal and go with the true experience of the nexus 6 (64 gb) play out. so far so good. will update at a later time. price $399. excellent .   i believe most of us who buy nexus 6 are android lovers. i used several android phones and others as well. i absolutely love this phone. here is why! 1. pure android (no unnecessary bloatware installed by the manufacturer or carrier) 2. perfect size to read, play, productivity, and phone (i rarely talk on the phone. if you use your phone for voice communication more often, it might too big for you). the only one thing that might you doubt: it is a little too big. the rest is perfect: nice screen, good battery life, nice camera, good bare bones android, snappy processor and a great experience as a whole. nice feeling in hand. screen display clarity is amazing. phone is blazing fast and despite its bulk able to use with one hand thanks to curved back .   nice phone. i bought this for $350, will definitely recommend this at that price. over all built quality is good and even a better brand that one plus which sells similar configuration phone at the same price tag. i would go for this instead of an one plus. it does have some software issues and even the screen size is very big, these are the two big drawbacks for this phone .   i couldn't find someone to answer me about this phone being able to connect with metropcs but i went ahead and got it anyway, it does work yay .   excellent. the phone is excellent. huge screen. great battery life. pure android experience .   i just got the nexus 6 and i love it! every aspect! metropcs users don't be afraid, works perfect with this carrier. i replaced my micro sim with a nano sim in a profesional metropcs store only with trained technicians. everybody there was in love with my phone! an sd card slot would have been perfect .   what a great deal! a very good price for a phone that still holds it's own spec-wise in comparison with new flagship devices .   great phone. great great phone to use .   met all my expectations. late to the game here but couldn't pass up the sale price even with the announcement of the new nexus 6 and nexus 5s around the corner. coming from a nexus 4 experience, i was happy with that device and comfortable with android 5.1.1 so transition is a breeze. i love the fact that i could transfer all my apps and many settings, etc immediatley via nfc. the phone itself is elegant. i'd heard much about the sheer girth of the device but i guess as a person who can palm a basketball, the in-hand feel here isn't off putting. performance has been snappy. i guess the biggest difference i can see between this and the 4 is how quickly downloads, updates and switching between apps is handled. on the 4 i could have several apps running but eventually i'd run into some super slow speed. i've not reached that threshold yet on the 6. why 4 stars rather than 5? as much as i like this camera, especially in comparison to the 4's very basic camera, it is slow. slow focus, slow everything. if i have to take a quick shot i can imagine missing the opportunity. space. listen, for years i said that my hard drive space isn't important because i always store to the cloud. 8 gigs was enough. but in the end it became limiting when unwanted to play around with new apps or listen to podcasts that aren't offered on my preferred streaming options like stitcher and soundcloud. since frabbing this 32 gig model, ive since added about 20 very useful apps that i just didn't have space for on the 4. why did i skip the 5? honestly? i was happy with the 4. a new phone would've been cool, novel. but i honestly wasn't interested. so what prompted me to move other than the steal of a price point at $349 here on amazon? again, the 4 is starting to experience some weird events and timing out on specific apps. it isnt constant but the intermittent issues are annoying. that plus the ability to use google's project fi made making a change attractive. i still use the 4, btw. since project fi is new and i want to test drive it for a while i'm keeping both. this is a great buy though. i'm only a week in but i'm in love with it .   awesome phone and an absolute steal for $350. i was just about to buy the moto x pure edition 2015, but when i read that the nexus 6 was available for $100 less ($350 vs $450 for the 32 gig models of each). i couldn't resist. the specs still hold up with today's flagships, and the fact that it runs pure android will keep it more up to date than most phones that are coming out right now. also amoled>lcd every time for me. buy it while you still can. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. the nexus 6 is really amazing but i'm really disappointed that there's no earpiece comes with the phone and i think that amazon must mention that in the description of the box continent. the big screen is hot. great phone, worked with verizon out of the box, just put in my sim and it works .   big upgrade from the galaxy s4. i'm all in on google products and this phone only made sense .  especially at $350.00. i'm grandfathered unlimited data on verizon and it works great on their network .   i love this phone. it has a great screen and wonderful voice recognition. i bought it unlocked through amazon, then ordered a sim card online through verizon. i installed the sim card myself and everything worked without problems. this is my favorite phone .   had to charge it daily (even with limited use) and it got very hot at nearly every charge & when the phone was used for more than 20 minutes. not worth the price .   my first real smartphone, great quality, really large phone (slightly larger than a closed nintendo 3ds xl for reference). let me add my 2 cents to the volumes that have been written about this phone. (i plan to keep it unless it really freaks out.) phone back gets uncomfortably warm when its charging - 108 degrees. not pleasant to hold. with brightness turned all the way up (not recommended for long periods as it cause slight burn-in of the amoled screen) is also reaches the same 108 degree temp, on front and back. its very slick/slippery as are many smart phones. so it needs a case. of course the case shields against the phones radiated heat (problems solved) and provides some accident protection. i wanted a large screen so when the price cut came, i was in. i think my galaxy s5 is a better (but smaller) phone. with a better camera. other reviews said the nexus 6's camera wasn't as good as the best out there and i have to agree. note, the screen brightness setting seems to affect the still photo brightness at photo capture time. (not sure) i have large-ish hands (can palm a basketball for a few seconds) so the phone's size isn't a problem .   the most common complaints about the nexus 6 have been price and battery life. other concerns, such as size, handling, camera quality are more subject to personal preference (see <http://www.androidauthority.com/nexus-6-review-566046>). i had dismissed upgrading because i was not prepared to pay $700 for a phone, regardless who made it. at $399, this is a bargain. a 64 gb 6 inch â€œphabletâ€ with an amoled screen and a very fast cpu and graphics processor. still not convinced? compare this to an 16gb 8 inch airpad mini wifi-only tablet clocking in at roughly the same price, which would you choose to take on the road with you? update 10/01: i have had the phone now for a week and i am very pleased with the purchase. beautiful screen. picture quality is very good in all lighting conditions except very dark. hdr+ is flawless on most shots. battery life has not been a problem. phone was shipped to canada via landmark which handled the import taxes. total cost landed was $426 us or $544 cnd, well under the $727 cnd currently in the google play store .   i really wish i could give this phone 5 stars but i can't. the phone is gorgeous, it has all the features i want it to have. so, why you might ask, do i only give it 3 stars? well, before you decide to jump and buy nexus 6 phone from google, do yourself a favor and start doing searches on all problems related to cell data connectivity with this phone. it simply sucks! i "upgraded" from my samsung galaxy s3, a great phone i never had any problems with. where i consistently was getting 4g with my s3 and 4 to 5 bars, with my nexus 6 i get 'h' and 2 bars. when i started to scour the internet if there are any issues, i found a ton of articles and complaints from people sharing the same story i have. predominantly it revolves around t-mobile networks which i find curious because it seems that google considers t-mobile as one of the leaders in the mobile industry. all in all, if you do not mind frustrations with the cell data transfers, the phone is great, the audio is much better and clearer than my samsung phone. but was it worth the jump? at this point, i am having second thoughts .   fantastic phone upgraded from nexus 5 to nexu6  .   nexus 5 good phone, nexus 6 ----- awesome and price is fantastic  .   i really like this phone so far. no led notification though .   anyway its definitely not for everyone but for people with big hands you'll love this phone/tablet .   worst phone i've ever owned. it lasted about one day before the bluetooth cut out. great solutions like "turn it off turn it back on" or "it's probably your apps cant be the phone" resulted in 6 hours of tech supporting it before getting so disgusted after the third system restore that it's now being returned. the phone has a long history of bugs and defects posted online, i will not be buying another one of these, i see now why tmobile no longer carries them .   not bad. great phone and os. sometimes it feels too big, but most of the time it's the perfect size for reading. this isn't a one handed phone .   have been wanting a replacement for my nexus 5, but the pricing was too high for the n6. with the price drop due to the soon to be released nexus 6 2015, i had to jump. for 399.00 with 64gb. what a steal. this is very large phablet. not usable with one hand. i always use both hands anyway. great sound, loud speakers, yes! camera is improved, but still not as good as other brands. great display too .   excelent. pros: this phone is pretty superb in terms of build quality clean unskinned android os is competitive with ios on almost every level excellent battery life amazing sound with stereo speakers cons: a bit too large for my everyday use display color saturation honestly hurt my eyes. camera doesn't shoot raw out of the box os sometimes made it difficult to find settings no micro-sd slot no fingerprint sensor android fans will find this phablet well equipped and comfortable, didn't turn out to be my cup of tea coming from an iphone 6, i returned it .   when i opened undamaged sealed nexus 6 box, item would not power on and back cover blown out of frame. was waiting to receive from ups at home so could join project fi. live in desert southwest. check on net for "nexus 6 back cover." apparently is a problem this phone and an expanding battery .   sending first unit back for a replacement. it will not keep a data signal. we're with t-mobile but issues have been happening with every carrier, sprint & t-mobile especially. after tweaking/changing apn settings, sim card, and a ton of other stuff the only option left is phone replacement .   fastests phone by date. i had been considering the nexus 6 since the price dropped to $499 but i hadnâ€™t purchased it. once the price dropped again i jumped at the deal. i switch phones quite a bit and currently have an iphone 6 and an oneplus one. i have been slowly moving more towards android over ios, but didnâ€™t want to spend another $700-800 on a newer phone. however, there were some things about the oneplus i wanted to improve upon. the good: the phone is extremely fast and smooth. stutters that have plagued other android phones iâ€™ve used are not present on the nexus 6. the camera is also better than on the oneplus one, but still not as good as the iphone 6. the other benefits are straight updates from google and no carrier bloat (using on at&t). and the screen! great looking, big screen. the bad: the battery life isnâ€™t great. itâ€™s acceptable but worse than the oneplus one. the sizeâ€¦the big screen is great, but i certainly canâ€™t use the phone with one hand. i knew that going in so not a huge concern, but it could be for some. and itâ€™s slippery! i donâ€™t want to add a case since the phone is big enough so i will try some skins on the back. there is one area where the oneplus one excels. great size that's manageable. overall itâ€™s a great phone and well worth it at the reduced price. build quality is typical motorola and excellent. the iphone 6 is going to a new home .   in case you are wondering .   this phone will work with sprint. the key is that you need to take it to their corporate store. the phone will need the esn added to the database and they will need to provide you with a sim card .   bought it and activated it on the us cellular network. went to the store and had a sales rep do it versus over the phone. had no issues .   i spent over an hour setting up the phone as it updated from 5.0 to 5.0.1 to 5.1 to 5.1.1 and then added even one more update. i added a handful of popular apps and a few games (nothing exotic or complex). i noticed that the phone had some lag and was not very snappy. even simplistic games had a lot of lag and stutter. i loved my old lg nexus 5 and even turned on encryption and didn't notice big performance differences with kitkat. i was expecting to love my new nexus 6. perhaps i had a defective nexus 6 or there was a performance bug in 5.1.1. anyhow, i am surprised, disappointed, and have it boxed up ready for return .   fantastic device, unbeatable price for what you get almost a year after release. looking forward to being able to use this device for years to come as it's a beast and has tons of value .   exactly what i expect. great cell phone .   i do not know of it's the real nexus 6 , hard to find out but i am having issues , not downloading applications , screen touching is sometimes not working . till now i am disappointed , i will try to go to a tmobile store and see of they can solve what i can't  .   this is one of the best android phones on the market. it has a huge 6 inch gorgeous 2k display with amoled technology. it has crisp, clear, and loud front facing speakers. it has stock android and will be supported for over 3 years. it has a great build quality and right now even the 64gb model is only $399! i know a lot of people might think that the phone is too big on paper, but even after just using it for a few minutes i don't think i could ever go back to another phone. it's easy to type on with the spacious keyboard, video watching is amazing with the big screen and front facing speakers and so is gaming. the camera is also very good as well, if you use hdr+ during low light areas, once you get the hang of it, you can take some really good photos of it. i have zero complaints on this phone. the snapdragon 805 processor with 3gb of ram and stock android make this phone run blazing fast, no hints of lag or even stutters at all. sure you might have a better camera with the galaxy s6, note 5, edge+ but you are also paying double, if not more for those phones vs getting a 64gb nexus 6 .   i like the phone, but just like anything else a new release is on the way after purchase .   fantastic phone .   got mine at the same time google sent me project fi invite .   i'm a happy camper. bought the phone for my son it was $580. we had to send it back after a week because it overheated while charging (with the turbo charger). apparently, motorola is fully aware of problem and indicated it was a flaw with the phone. needless to say, don't buy as it has some safety concerns/manufacturer defect .   this device is seriously fragile. it slipped from my fingers into the grass, possibly finding the only rock, and cracked the screen. it is already so big that i hadn't put one of the cases around it as well, i did have a basic screen protector though .   honestly, the phones great. doesn't come with a sim card so be prepared for that. really i'm giving 2 stars because i paid $480 the day before the price dropped to $350. just my luck .   i love this phone. for now on i think i'm staying with the nexus line. it takes too long to get os updates with non-nexus devices in my opinion. also, i like the feel of stock android much better. i will say the first one i ordered was defective. it would reboot randomly, multiple times a week. even after numerous factory resets per instruction from motorola it still continued to reboot. motorola was going to warranty it, but i called amazon first. i was about 6 days past the 30 day replacement policy, but i called and they replaced it regardless. this new one is perfect! it has not randomly rebooted at all. i have had this for over a month, so i am know it's good to go. enjoying project fi at the moment .   using it with google project fi. very, very happy .   my unit arrived in great shape after charging it right away out of the box the temperature of the phone was too hot. i turned it off 2 hours later while still off it was still hot a would not turn on or if it did you receive a message your device has malfunction with some google error code and would turn off. returned the same day hassle free .   i am sure maybe it was just mine. but i'll save that money till the new nexus phones come out in the coming months .   good phone, but it needs more features like tv remote .   perfect smartphone. bit large for first time users but once you get used to it, you can't look back. the qhd screen is a treat to the eyes. the icons and text look amazingly clear. amoled screen makes it even better. the camera quality is great as well. the body of phone is very appealing, with metal edges. i bought two of them. one white 64gb and the 32gb blue. the new updated price of nexus 6 is more apt. i bought the nexus 6 64gb at the original price of 699$ which i now believe was overpriced for it. nexus always has an advantage of getting first updates from google, that is always a plus .   the first nexus 6 i got had a cracked display. the replacement i have had for two weeks and a couple rows in the display are "dead". very distracting .   doesn't got away with reboot. has this fabrication issue been fixed? not sure if i should return or replace .   positive: * works well on verizon. the nano sim from my verizon iphone 6 works perfectly with this nexus 6. i have the xt1103 version purchased from amazon. the product description incorrectly states that it doesn't work on verizon. * gps navigation works well using nokia here maps while offline (on airplane mode while location services is on). * quick charger works well and is fast. * vanilla android. negative: * curved back is comfortable for holding with one hand, but it makes it less stable in car phone carriers. * battery life is short. good thing the quick charger works well. you should also get a good vehicle quick charger (e.g., anker powerdrive+ 1). * android is still not as smooth functioning as ios. this is not nexus 6 specific, but it's still worth noting .   this is a great phone, though many of my friends and family tease me about its large size. using the phone function can be unwieldily due to the size. however, it performs like a dream in all functionality. love it .   the phone itself is fantastic. there are a few issues with android 5.1.1 (most notably trying to tweak the priority and interruption settings for notifications), but i love the feel and the size of the nexus 6. definitely wouldn't regret this purchase .   i bought this phone for my husband. he loves it! the phone is well made, and the handwriting inputs of foreign languages are fast and accurate .   well first off i was stupid and bought this when i have verizon wireless and they don't support this phone unless you buy it from the store but i returned it and got it at the store and it's an amazing phone don't be intimated by the big screen you get used to it pretty quickly and it's fast! if you don't have verizon get this phone .   works great! i was able to give my wife my nexus 5 so we could change carriers and get better service. it was easy to unlock the bootloader and load a custom rom. my only negative is the design for the placement of the power and volume. i wish they were in a different position since they get mostly covered by my car cradle .   i won't go into a bunch of detail about this phone since there are so many reviews already out there, both here on amazon and all over the web, but i will say that this is an excellent phone. i'm coming from having used nothing but windows phone and ios devices and vanilla android is great. i did briefly have a moto g so i got a feel for android from that phone, but it was just too slow (i think the lack of ram was that phone's main problem) so i upgraded to this and it's great. it's fast, takes good photos, doesn't have a bunch of carrier bloatware on it and is a very usable size (though i also think the lumia 1520 is a usable size so take from that what you will). really haven't had any complaints about it and the quick charge feature is just flat out awesome. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone. edit: of all the phones i've owned over the years (from stuff like the nokia n73 and n95 to the first iphones, to various windows phones and now a handful of android devices) this is the first one i've ever had a screen crack on. i'm not going to fault the phone for it, but i would just recommend being sure you get a case that offers great protection. my hand and arm twitched (due to a neurological disease i have) and the phone fell on the floor from a height of maybe three feet and the screen is just shattered and is now starting to come apart in tiny, very sharp pieces. so now i'm at a crossroads of whether i get another of these, upgrade to the 5x or 6p or get one of the new lumias, but either way i'll be dropping some serious money to get any of them .   very easy to root! simply unlock the bootloader in the menu, install windows drivers, run cf autoroot, done! i love not having all the bloatware from the cell provider. the stereo speakers sound great. battery life is comparable to my old note 3. the camera app is lacking. would be nice to have 60fps camcorder like my old note 3 .   i have a lot of problems with my nexus 6. i lost conectivity frequently and i have to restart it. often i try to call somebody and the phone tilt while dialing, again i have to restart it. y dont know if it is the phone or the android .   overall good phone. i bought 2 though and in one of them flash/flashlight does not work. what's worse is that it seems like someone tampered with it. did i get refubrished phone  .   i looove this phone, huge screen, very fast system and great shape to fit in hands. the system does seem to freeze or crash when i have gmail and chrome open .   is fast sleek as a great battery runs everything beautifully i love the big screen personally and the camera takes amazing pictures it has so many cool features to like the turbo charge and the ambient display if your pure android lover this is the phone for you. this is an awesome phone. have had it for about a month now and i am totally impressed. my other phone was a galaxy note 2, which was good or still is but the nexus is far better. no more tons of bloatware running in the background. the nexus 6 runs very smooth no problems what so ever. activated on the verizon network and everything is working great. if you are thinking about this phone get it you will not be disappointed. great sound, super display, simple to use just do it, and get the nexus 6. i was a little hesitant to buy such a big phone, as i have heard lots of people complain. but im very glad i did! i don't think i canbgo back to a small phone after enjoyong such a premium product. it fits well in my pocket, that was my nunber one concern. when i whip it out, people are impressed with it's size and vitality. i love the big screen, so much easier to enjoy things on it. we are a culture who looks at their smart phones for several hours a day, might as well delight in the experience and make the view as big and clear as possible; that's what the nexus 6 can do for you. the phone is awesome, just go to gsmarena.com and check out nexus 6 specs. it runs flawlessly. now here is my only negative-ish comment: i like to save money. so i got this phone "used". i put quotes because im not really sure if it was used or not. but amazon said it was. you see, i went to the used section and found one selling from the amazon warehouse describing it as "item is in original packagaing, but packaging has damage". i took that as "new item, but box has some scuffs and scrapes on it". i figured that was well worth the $80 i will save, so i bought it. i knew i took a gamble. when it arrived, the packaging was definitely scraped up and dirty, but upon first glance, phone looked brand new. and still had the plastic screen covering on it. it looked like it had never been touched, and im positive it hasnt been used. but when i flipped the phone over, it had one noticeable scratch om the backing. like someone did a light chop to it with a steak knife, maybe 1/4" in lenght and very thin, but still noticeable. it doesnt look like it was dropped, bc the rest of the back was in pristine condition. and phone works great. i can only speculate what happened at this point. but what matters is i saved $80 by getting a new phone with a small scratch on the back. was well worth it .   i hate it. it's poorly made. it was dropped less than 2 feet from the ground and the screen shattered and it isn't covered by the warranty. the phone is not popular anywhere except in very urban areas and there is no place that sells protection for it nearby, including the at &t store, and they have everything. (that's within 30 miles, and i'm 90 minutes away from chicago). i truly regret not buying a more popular samsung or apple device when i was shopping. at least you can buy protection for them pretty much any where. now i'm out hundreds of dollars that took me forever to save for this purpose and still need a phone. i will never buy another motorola product again and definitely will not try to purchase it online. overall it has been an awful and expensive learning experience .   very nice phone. it's a great phone for what it is. but it's too big for me. i was worried it would be too big and those fears were realized. love the large screen, the build quality, the reception, the durability and almost everything about the phone. if i could just get rid of the lag it would be amazing. i moved to the nexus 6 from a nexus 5 and was very disappointed to get this kind of lag. i have had all the nexus devices since the nexus one and this is the first time i have had this kind of experience. one of the main reasons for getting a nexus device is that the software is clean and you get crisp response. unfortunately that doesn't happen on this device even with the latest software updates .   a google phone (or phablet) of 2014. the only pity is a missing aarch64 cpu .   still under testing.though the phone charger is not working .  disappointed from amazon .   i love this phone .   i got this phone, refurbished, because i guess you could say i'm a bit of a cheapskate. the whole reason i needed this phone in the first place, was to use it with google fi, which i wanted to use to save money as well! i've got to say, the phone, compared to the oneplus one (my previous daily driver), is a beast as far as size goes. without a case, however, it is comparable and nearly identical to my wife's iphone 6+. it does make one-handed manipulations difficult, even for someone who has larger hands such as myself, but a good keyboard (swiftkeyâ in my case) with swiping and predictive input, makes it a lot less of an issue! the screen is absolutely gorgeous, crystal clear and sharp! the camera takes very nice pictures, and has no lag or delays to it. as soon as you press the shutter/snap button, the picture is taken, unlike other devices where the is a momentary "blip", by which time the photo is taken, the moment to be captured has already passed. i must say, my favorite part of it is the "pure" android experience. there's never any question about whether the issue is due to the rom, os, hardware, other app from the os or manufacturer. there are 2 (really 1) sources here, motorola (google), or google. also, system updates come quickly, since there is no merging in of functionality and fixes to be done, such as by other manufacturers or software/oses .   love it, but it's a little too big even though i have large hands .   this phone is my daily driver. yes it is big and you will either like that feature or you will not. it fits in my pocket with no problems but i don't wear 'skinny' jeans, people who do might have an issue. the screen is very nice (i like the saturation of oled) and because of the size everything is easy to read. the processor is fast and i haven't really noticed any lagging. the price i paid, about $515, is very reasonable. no more contract phones for me. this phone is the first nexus device i have owned and i like the fact that i get updates without having to wait for samsung and at&t to add their bloatware. as far as flagship android phones go, if you can live with the size of the phone, this is the best bang for the buck .   seriously, what do you say, it's a work horse, its a nexus and made by motorola. if you like your motox or motog,e you will like this phone. big screen, i often use this and my blu studio6 as mobile tablet replacements. they are phones with built in data with screens that are large enought to use as tablets in a pinch. great taveling device .   don't know how it compares to other phablets, but compared to the note 4,it sucks! i have very big hands and this thing is still a little too wide,the big screen is nice otherwise, but it might as well be a tablet, where as the note 4 is a lot more easily handable and in my opinion a true phablet. not having a led notification without root is just unacceptable. so far i can't say anything good about this phone other than the large screen .   i was on the fence between the nexus 6 and lg g4 for verizon service. i have unlimited data due to being grandfathered in and love taking advantage of that fact. i have always envied the nexus line of phones for being both well priced and pure android. i had a lot of deciding factors as to why i went with the nex6 over the g4 so this review will compare but can still be taken as a pro's/con's review. i've personally always been a mod/root kind of phone user and if i see something i don't like i want to change it. i also love storing huge flac files for offline music listening. i love amoled and find the newer displays to have a lower angle of viewing. coming from my samsung s4 i find it more familiar i suppose. i know at this point there are better cameras out there than what is included with the nex 6 but i didn't by the phone to take amazing photos, i just don't want potato photos. the nex 6 is fully customizable. even if you don't root or do anything crazy this phone is still cleaner and has no bloat or ui junk that slows down phones and eats up cpu cycles. the nex 6 does not have a removable sd card slot or removable battery. coming from the s4 i will miss these features but i think i'm techy enough to be able to replace my own battery down the road if need be. lack of sd card means less storage but i'll just have to switch to hq mp3 or stream which shouldn't be the deciding factor and it wasn't. i compared several topl phones and found qhd phones tended to have viewing angle issues. at angles that weren't perfect 90 degrees to your face there was a very slight darkening on the top or bottom of the display. amoled has no issue like this or at least the nex 6 doesn't at all. other displays show colors brighter and better but for the sake of the extra few screen space it was a welcome sacrifice. i was able to take some very nice photos and got the job done. focus was fast and faster than my s4 so no complaints. only real downside i have is the pink tint the screen gets when the brightness is 'very' low. i either read or saw in a video review, not sure which, that people were claiming that the pink tint was a 'feature' but it actually wasn't. it was a flaw in the amoled display. the reason why it's present on the nex6 and not other totl amoled screens is they tend to limit the lowest brightness to prevent it from getting to that point. that said the nex 6 can get very very dark and the pink tint gets worse the lower it goes. having the option to look pink and get darker vs not i'd rather have go darker. long story short, i went ahead and ordered it and everything went as smooth as butter. i received the xt1103 (us) running 5.0 version lnx07m (developer). is how i got it working was simply cutting my 'active' micro sim card i had in my samsung s4 (verizon) and plugging it into the nexus 6. i boot the nex 6 up and in less than 5 mins i was connected to lte and data was working and i was registered on the network. i did however not get any notifications for ota updating to 5.1.1 or anything so i had to flash it using some tools but after some usual basic issues everything went smoothly and i'm on 5.1.1 (lmy47z). i'm sure this review was a little spotty and all over the place but hopefully i covered most concerns. i was having a hard time deciding between this nex 6 and other totl phones but ultimately it came down to being more open to do whatever i want to do with, almost instant android updates vs being dependent on other companies to eventually drop support and updates their device for newer. i'm still able to put the newest version of android on my 2012 nexus 7 and it runs as smooth as butter. any questions feel free to ask! for those who are wondering, yes this does work with verizon. i'm sure verizon stores can activate it with a new sim but for me it worked by using my current sim (even though i had to resize it to fit). just make sure you have a xt1103 version and an active sim card .   excellent phone once rooted and install the chroma rom, then you will have great battery life and no heating issues :) http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/development/rom-chroma-01-11-2015-t3000003. it's good phone, but poor design. too heavy and isn't elegant. like it,but the hotspot makes the heat so high. really great phone. stock android is buttery smooth and i have had no issues with this phone. a bit on the large side but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. the onltly thing i can think in terms of improvements would have been an ir sensor like the g4 has but that's not a make or break feature for me anyway .   it's a powerful smartphone .   i love my new phone. having this phone enabled me to join the google fi network. i also love how clear the screen is .   what is not to love .   i really like this phone. i went from a t-mobile samsung phone filled with bloatware to this pretty cool android. i was concerned that it would be too big but now i don't know if i could go back to a smaller phone. yah, it is like pop-tart sized but that becomes an asset. the display is beautiful.it is lightning fast with long battery life. updates come ota easily. i like the camera and find my photos look pretty darned good. i understand that there are notification leds that only work if you root. i do miss having the leds for incoming message notifications but found app workarounds. found a pretty slim case and with a glass screen protector here on amazon that work well .   love it. great phone! not recommended for hobbits or any type of person with small hands .   this phone is quite large. it is nice for watching videos with the sound and size of the screen. i went from a pretty big phone (note 2) and i have no intentions of going back to another phone. i use it with the project fi and it seems to have pretty good service in the 2 weeks i have had it. i have not had a chance to do some travelling and see how it is in other areas .   i really don't know what to say, other than it is a nexus. for those of you looking to tinker with solid hardware, fastest google updates and the most developer support i don't need to explain to you this is the phone to get. hardware wise it has some of the best specs around, even for being nearly 7-8 months old at this point there is really nothing out there that rivals it just yet, at least in my opinion. the 6in screen size is intimidating to some people, and i can say for me at the beginning i didn't know if i would like that, it seemed big. having it now, i know i could never go back to anything else much smaller. i picked up my wifes iphone 6 and was disappointed on how small it was and can't see myself with something that small. even my phone before was the moto x 2014 edition and that seemed small in comparison even though it was only .8in smaller. the camera takes great pictures, and the software, well is the way android should be, no skins and what every android should have. some complain about battery life and i would like to know what some of them are doing, as i consistently get 3-4 hours screen on time and run through a day from 530am to 1am the next day not needing charging. i know some issues were involved with older version of android but this runs the latest 5.1.1 and also has the m preview from the next version of android available. i have tested android m and i do have to say we are in for a treat. it is more robust, smoother, stable, and battery sipping. and for those not afraid to tinker, the dev community is the biggest for the nexus line, and the custom options make this phone to be better than how it ships. i highly recommend this phone, this is the os that google envisioned, and the device to run it, you can't get any better than that .   i've always loved the nexus line of products, but after almost a month of ownership i'm still on the fence about whether or not it's too big for me. but otherwise it's a fantastic device, aside from some camera firmware bugs .   i'm not an overly tech savvy guy, so i can't write a decent review. but i can tell you that i wanted this phone for a while and that i couldn't be happier with what i got. there are probably phones with better specs at a slightly higher price point, but i think that the fact that this is google's phone just makes it too good for it's competition. the reliability of updates and the optimization just make it amazing. it might be too large for some people, but the huge screen makes it excel when viewing videos, photos or even reading a book. i am just too happy with it to write anything bad .   excellent and honest sellers. i have tried it twice and yet both times it failed my expectations. the manufacturing qc is poor for this device. the first one i had had a faulty touch screen and the second i had, the sim tray didn't sit flush in the device. stock android is great, the front facing speakers are great, and so is everything else but the front facing camera. size is big yes but it's a phablet. motorola needs to invest more into the build quality of each device .   i loved my nexus 5 and this phone is just a bigger and better version of that. very happy with it .   yes, this phone is just a bit too big, but it's also exactly the right size. i find reading, taking and viewing pictures and videos, playing games, just about everything i find more enjoyable to do with this phone rather than my previous nexus 5. i even find myself no longer feeling the need to look for a tablet. even my wife, with much smaller hands, loves it. and even after i downloaded absolutely everything i wanted (except for the entire doctor who series), i still have 32 gb of free space! i definitely recommend the spigen slim armor case, as well; we bought it along with our phones for a decent price here on amazon. it provides very good protection, good access to all ports, and i find the buttons have the perfect pressure balance: not too much pressure is required, but you won't accidentally press it by accidentally touching that side, either .   took longer to arrive than what i expected but its the us version as they advertise and the price is the best in the market. great phone as you'd expect .   even after all of my research, this phone was still larger than i expected when i finally held it in my hand. coming from a moto x (first gen), it's quite a size difference. the battery seems to last all day with light to moderate use (text, email, web browsing) on wifi. i'm finding i won't need to plug it in until 11 or 12pm. i miss a few features from the moto x, like gestures to open the camera and moto assist for notifications while driving, and suppressed notifications while sleeping. being that this is sort of a super-sized moto x, i was a little disappointed there was no way to access those features either naively, or through the play store. the curved back is a mild annoyance when the phone is resting on a flat surface. i'll try to reply to a text while the phone is on my desk, and its nearly impossible to form a single word using if gesture typing. pressing letters, although effective, will still cause the phone to wobble if it isn't held in place. still though, its a lovely device with a smooth and responsive os. my issues are nothing a can't adjust to .   this phone is enormous. it hurts my thumb to try to reach across it. bought it to use with google fi. getting used to it. great to use sideways for movies or other videos .   i don't get all the complaints over it being a big phone. that's one of the selling points! surely you wouldn't buy an expensive phone like this without doing some basic research? i knew exactly what i was getting before i ever ordered it. anyway, i love love love my n6. it's fast and responsive, and the massive screen is just gorgeous. it came with an old developer build from pre-release, and i had some minor issues with it at first after running the necessary system updates (the microphone wouldn't work from google keyboard for some odd reason, and android device manager didn't work properly), but i reset it to factory settings and it's working perfectly now. great phone, highly recommended. my one gripe is that i wish there were an sd card slot, but 64gb is still a good amount of storage .   awesome. fast and very well crafted. get some time to get used to not handle with one hand like my old nexus 5. the screen is gorgeous. i would prefer if hã¡s 5.5. great phone without having the provider baking useless apps into it. love this phone .   the price is very reasonable .   the nice phone ever, for me of course. better than iphone because i hate the apple. no idea how well this product works because i did not even get to turn the device on. there are some serious design flaws when it comes out of the box with the back cover popped open. apparently motorola has not addressed the swelling battery issues with this model. have i mentioned that it was not even turned on? steer clear of this pos. (please forgive the cruddy picture, it was taken on my old flip phone .  go figure.). great phone .   very weak battery. i loved the nexus 5 except for one problem, its battery life was crappy. the nexus 6 completely solves this problem! i intend to keep it until i am forced to upgrade .   awasome .   great phone, you get used to the size and the screen real estate is nice .   this motorola nexus-6 pure stock firmware device is the only way to experience google android as it was meant to be. it is built with the highest quality flagship materials and does not contain bloat-ware installed by manufacturers or cell phone carriers. i also like the fact that nexus devices are the first to get the latest firmware updates on a regular basis. a lot of phone worth every penny .   overheating is the main drawback. i upgraded to n6 from my note 2. when you move from 4g lte to any other spectrum the mobile data connection hangs and the only way out is to do a soft reset on the data connection. i did not see it initially for about a week. but after that the hang was so regular to the point that the phone was meaningless. looked around on the web and was surprised to find that i am not the only one. (search for "nexus 6 data connection issues"). tried all updates and other steps that you can see on the web but no improvement. i am back to my old note2 which works flawlessly in the same areas where n6 had connection issues. this experience makes we wonder what is the best phone for an android user. amazon's shipping and return policy was seamless and it was the only good thing to mention in this whole ordeal .   beware - this phone did not have android os lollipop (5.0.1) installed on it - even though the product details / description on amazon says it comes with lollipop. lollipop is required to run google project fi mobile service. this device had kitkat (4.4.4) on it - so i can not connect to google fi, without downloading several system updates - which is taking forever, and not successful at this point. while i am in love with the nexus 6 in theory - i am extremely upset with that this was shipped with kitkat, as i can not use it with google project fi cellular service - yet. update: this phone eventually worked on google fi network - but required 3 system download updates (5.0; 5.01 and 5.1.1), and then installation of "project fi" from the google play store, before it would connect to google fi. so: it does work on google fi but you will have to spend about and hour updating the os and installing project fi app .   this is a great phone and it's a little too big. when i'm on the phone i noticed my hand starts cramping because i have to over extend my hand to keep it from slipping. also the camera is not that great for taking pictures .   this phone's size seemed like a disadvantage at first, but once i adjusted to it i was able to stretch out and sleep comfortably without my head or feet hanging off the edges. sheets made for a california king size are only slightly tight on the device. it's a big phone. phone is very well made and thinner than anticipated. screen is excellent and when dimmed gets very dark if using at night without blinding yourself is a priority .   nice phone .   first nexus i bought that i didn't love. didn't feel good in the hand. didn't like the material. not really white. more like a dull grey. returned it. good think google coming out with 2 new phones later this year .   this phone is big, however it is an amazing phone .   works great .   you know what brought you to this phone .   buy it already .   good phone. huge .   there are enough reviews of this phone already out there and on here. though i'll have to say i will never buy another phone without front facing stereo speakers. these speakers are stunning especially if you are used to cupping your hand behind your phone to watch - and hear - a video! stereo separation even works amazingly well. mainly though i just want to confirm that i did receive the xt1103 model in the 64gb blue. it said "ships from and sold by amazon" so pay attention. also oddly, i ordered at 1am tuesday morning (ok, ok, 1am monday night) and it arrived 4pm weds - with the free shipping option! i'm sure it's just warehouse luck + ups luck that i got it so fast, but still  .   that's like wow impressive. another couple things on the phone, i don't see that pink tint in low light level that people are talking about. colors do go a bit off toward red - at extremely low brightness - but still, white or gray doesn't go to pink for me. just slight warmer color temp so far as i can tell. working with color balance is part of my job so i was worried it would be annoying to picky eyeballs. not the case, on day one at least .   love this phone. i wasn't sure about the size at first. it seemed very big. but i got use to it .   the shipping was fast and phone was in very good condition .   i got this phone on prime day for $100 off! i only mention it because i probably would not have purchased it at the regular price. but i've loved nexus devices for as long as they've been around and this one is no exception .   the phone came defective with a broken speaker. many others are having this issue, and motorola will not even acknowledge it, to avoid profit loss i'm getting. the speaker starts at high volume and decreases within 3 seconds to about 40%, everytime, and after hours and hours of searching for solutions online, the only thing i found was people saying they had to send their phone back and get a new one. i can't not have a phone for a few days, due to my work. definitely the last motorola phone i'll ever buy. do not buy .   bought phone after an obsessive amount of research, upgrading from a samsung galaxy s4 (gt-i9500). first off, the screen of the n6 is roughly the size of the entire s4 (case included), so it's huge. and i must emphasize, that is just the display. so it's a tiny bit bigger than that altogether. get out the rulers, because you really need to be ready for a big phone that'll usually make you use two hands. my hands are roughly 7" long from middle finger tip to bottom of palm (i feel strange to mention this, but my review needs reference) and i find this phone just comfortable enough. some people complain about this, i don't. or at least don't anymore .   got the phone. beautiful display. beautiful audio. camera handles far better than s4 and makes colors really pop in hdr+ mode and far less blurry shots (shaky hands). it's beautiful. no sd slot, which sucks, but oh well. one thing i noticed is that the whole ui is gigantic out of the box. i felt like an old man who got an old man tv remote with the gigantic numbers. so i did what i felt needed to be done: i modded the hell out of the phone after updating to 5.1.1. among the many things i've done to the phone, i changed the dpi so everything looks all tiny and now the phone practically believes it's a small tablet (you'd need to do your homework to follow what i'm saying here). running stable and running beautifully. buttery smooth, as advertised, and zero bloatware. i have no complaints on this purchase. turbo charging rocks, wireless charging rocks. having a dpi so small that it makes the note 4 feel like it's wasting screen space is beyond awesome. especially since i use my phone as a tiny workstation (when i connect my bluetooth keyboard) and use my office apps or any other work related apps. phone fits snugly in my pockets and the round back doesn't create an awkward flat surface within my jeans. i'd recommend this phone for anyone who can handle a big phone .   unable too connect to at&t lte network. it seems that this is more likely a manufacturer issue; particularly, the international version of the phone. too many at&t users have issues connecting to the lte band. i wouldn't recommend this phone for heavy internet users because the phone only connects to the h+ band and that is pretty slow. the one +one is a better option. tried it and will be reverting to it .   awesome device. very fast and responsive. i keep picking it up and admiring it. the pictures don't do it justice. you gotta hold this bad boy in your hand to start really feeling the love. not a toy like iphone. p.s. camera stinks .   i am happy with my nexus 6. having read numerous reviews of nexus 6, everything looked good to me except i was concerned that the camera might not be good enough. i still feel burned by my experience with the camera on my old samsung galaxy s4 and i really did not want to repeat that bad experience. (the s4's camera was totally crap in low light conditions.) i am happy to report that the camera on nexus 6 is fairly good, even in low light conditions. i am very happy with it. i also considered these models, because reviews said they have excellent cameras: i didn't buy samsung galaxy note 4 (or samsung galaxy s6) because samsung (and / or t-mobile) are known for infrequent upgrades of the android os. i didn't buy lg g4 because "lg has stated that they will never support unlocking the bootloader" (https://www.androidpit.com/lg-g4-vs-nexus-6-comparison). so far so good. i was never a fan of an iphone. i had one issued from work and my bear paws of hands it was hard to text and email. i switched to am opo and loved it. however i dropped that and the screen cracked. so i got the nexus 6 to try out project fi. so far im loving the phone .   after having this phone for 5 days when i would receive an incoming call the phone would ring but you were unable to answer it because the call never appeared on the screen, even if the phone was locked. spent two hours on the phone with motorola troubleshooting the problem. a factory reset was the only way to resolve the problem. will probably return to amazon. if you google nexus 6 receiving call problems you will see a lot of info about this trouble. think twice before you buy. bought this for my wife to use on google's project fi. it is a large phone but an excellent one. it took about 5 minutes to get used to the the size. i bought a 64gb for myself and we both agree it they are great phones. the sale price was the deciding factor and its ships free with prime. we just got our fi invites last week and will be switching over from verizon to fi this coming week as soon as the new sims arrive .   excellent, everything is ok, the phone is big but is ok. it is was a little bigger and heavier than i expected but still fits in my shirt pocket (barely). after a few days i wondered why i lived with tiny phones in the past. you definably want to get a protective case for this. the screen is big, bright, clear with sharp colors. i'm totally spoiled now. the processor and memory are fast and responsive. multi-tasks like crazy. i didn't understand the task manager at first, i had all of the apps running at once with no preceptable performance problems. the 64gb option is the smart way to go, since there is no sd expansion slot. since it's a google development platform it automatically gets all of the latest updates immediately. this is the harley davidson of smart phones. you will want the "root explorer" (speed software) and "vlc media player" (videolan.org) apps to get the full benefit out of this thing .   best android ever .   very very nice. we love the nexus 5 and nexus 6 .   this phone exceeded all my expectations. yes, it's really huge, and sometimes it can be inconvenient  .   but it's zippy, responsive, and the battery life is much longer than on my nexus 5. if you could afford it, definitely get this. plus getting the first android updates are a plus. i just got a 5.1.1 update today .   great phone at 500. a little big for my taste but the screen is amazing. best android phone .   awesome. decent phone as i came from a nexus 5. the size is a little overwhelming with a case on it. without a case, its not too bad. nexus software of course is fast but the only thing i did not like about this phone was the camera. took too long to take pictures .   this phone is my favorite phone, period! i don't mind give up my sd card slot and external battery access for a nexus device. but i will mention a couple of things: 1. this phone does have support for all four major carriers. but i will tell you if you're planning on using this on verizon or sprint; that you need to buy the verizon or sprint model only. especially for sprint, because if you are planning on using the unlocked google play edition ( which this one is ) sprint will not recognize this esn because it's not in sprints database. which is sort of lame and very stupid on sprint part. now if you're planning on using it on verizon, and have a current verizon nano sim android phone; then it should work perfectly fine. but you can't start a new line with an unlocked nexus 6 2. now if you're planning on using this on t mobile or at&t. i will say that i've had one of the best experiences on both networks, but if you get it out of the box without lollipop 5.1.1 then you will be waiting a while. unfortunately at&t has control over when you get that update. supposedly it has been rolling out lately but i'm not for sure on that .   also the only network it offers hd voice on a gsm carrier, is t mobile. unfortunately at&t doesn't have that feature turned on yet, so when you're in a call it switches over to hsdpa+. which sucks , the speeds are slow and coverage isn't as go as at&t lte. but besides that, this phone last me all day on battery. performs amazingly, and just does everything the google said it would do. i only wish i had an sd card slot and removable battery. but if you're very fortunate to own a nexus device, or have the money to own a nexus device. consider yourself lucky .   i will keep this one short and sweet. i picked this phone up for project fi. i am a tech junky and was looking for a reason to pick one up. to give you an idea of the phones i currently own. i have the following or had the following in the last couple months. oneplus one oppo find 7 moto x 2014 lg g4 lumia 930 moto x 2013 lumia 1530 with that said. i have owned small to large devices. so to get that out of the way. yes, it is a large device. if you have small hands you probably will want to find a smaller device like the moto x 2014. i am very pleased with the nex6. the screen is beautiful. the sound quality is amazing with its front facing speakers. the camera is good. it's not great but it will do the trick in a well lit area. low light shots were sub par. the processing speed is excellent and have not noticed any lag to speak of. call quality is very clear and sound is on point. i didn't run into any of the issues i have read about such as speaker issues. pro's call quality front facing speakers sound great screen is amazing build quality feels premium and sturdy no lag when playing games or multi tasking wifi connection is strong updates to latest os before others cons price is kind of high when compared to other flagship devices. camera in low light size could be considered a con for some but then again you should expect a big phone based on specs. i have found it difficult to find a tempered glass protector due to the curved glass on the edges. this is a con for me. wrap up this is a very well built device. with the screen and sound quality rising above most of the other devices i have owned. i think i will keep this around for a while .   i have network connectivity issue .   :). to say i love this phone is an understatement. i'm a tech-aholic. i have always bought what's coolest, fastest, and on and on. also, because of my creative background, i have been an apple user since i bought my first mac in 1992. i ditched my iphone about 4 years ago after seeing how flexible, fast and powerful the android operating system was. the only thing that annoyed me was all the crap software that at&t and companies like samsung add over the top of an already functional android operating system. well, buying a straight google phone is the way to go. before i get into this phone's features, the biggest one, for me, is what it doesn't have .  all the junk bloatware from at&t and samsung! performance: i can't say enough about how fast and responsive this phone is. going from a samsung galaxy device to the nexus 6, i feel like i just upgraded to 5 series bmw after driving what i thought was a luxury vehicle. it's fast but efficient. the combination of not having all those battery sucking at&t and samsung apps, and the 3250 mah battery (which is big) combines to give this phone great "battery mileage." i'm on my phone all day and it rarely needs a charge until i go to bed around 10:30 or 11 pm. that's surprising considering the 6 inch screen. also, it appears to be engineered really well as there are small things that are done right. the speaker(s). when you turn on songza or any other streaming music app, the sound coming out of the phone, itself, is really good and fairly loud. this surprised me too. oh, i almost forgot this. it charges insanely fast too. i can go from 5% battery capacity to a full charge in under 90 minutes! build & aesthetics: this phone is so solid. you really won't understand until you hold one in your hand and feel it. it almost feels like a solid piece of metal and the curved back make this large phone feel smaller. camera: this was my one hesitation before i pulled the trigger on this phone and i'm glad i bought it. there is so much press out there bagging on the nexus 6's camera. it's stupid. this camera is legit. now that i have said that, you need to know that i have professional photography experience. my wife has a galaxy s6 and while the megapixel rating of the nexus 6 camera may be lower, i don't think i will miss it. because the sensor is quality making the images quality. you see, larger images aren't always better. there comes a point where it's overkill and those extra pixels aren't doing anything for you. all you need to know is that the camera on this phone is spectacular. it focuses quickly, and, even more importantly, is phenomenal at "metering" (adjusting the lighting) based on what you're shooting. overall: (incase you're wondering, no, this is not a paid review. i bought this phone like everyone else.) again, i love this phone. it's stupid-fast, the camera and battery are awesome, it's ridiculously well built and i'll never have to be concerned about what garbage my carrier put on my phone from the factory. :). the phone is exactly the same i`ve waited for. and it`s an international version, model xt1100 .   big phone, no one-hand operation available. great screen .   i went from note 4 to this phone and love it, nothing beats stock android in terms of user experience. my only real gripe about this phone is the battery life. for such a large phone, it should have a better battery life than it does; the note 4 certainly sets the standard in that regard. also, some chargers/usb cables will not work work with this phone; you will see the charging icon on the top right, but your phone will not actually charge! this was the case when using my note 4 charger, but i haven't had any issues using the quick charger than came with the nexus 6 .   works great delivered on time .   very nice easy to use. excelent, is a huge phone but very confortable, nice screen and fast. recomendations use with protector .   overall performance is very good .  only screen resolution is below my expectation compared to samsung s6 .   actually it was greet but until now i face problem with battery it's so week. the phone should have been my favorite phone of the year if it does not have some problems from the top speaker. i have done like 4 replacements, either it is on google store or amazon, all of them have the same issue. the top speaker makes some crackling/popping sound every time i touch the screen (i already disable the touching sound). then i realize that all the phone was defective and many people have the same problem like me, it is just that you guys dont really care about it or havent noticed it yet. 2 stars since i still like it, but the problem annoys me more than that .   until now its working very good, one problem is the screen size is really big .   this is my first android phone and i like it. it is fast, and big- which i like being an old timer it is easier to read and also i don't fat finger as much typing. it has run everything i have put on it very smoothly, and the battery lasts me a couple of days, i mostly just listen to music or audiobooks. might not be the best phone for everyone, because it is big, but it fits my paws just fine and no problem in my pocket .   but i don't wear "skinny jeans.". excellent wish it had direct connect .   great phone so far, size is a bit much, but if you treat it more as a small tablet, it's incredible. just a note, i use speaker phone or bluetooth it, so i never really hold it to my ear. great for internet and games, picture quality is far improved from the nexus 5 .   excellent phone. does not come with the mountain of bloat every samsung phone has. i use verizon - i had no problem getting the phone activated. you must go to an actual verizon store - not a kiosk, authorized dealer, or hauzau shabdabbadab on the corner of 7th and r in se dc. hauzau will not be able to activate this phone on the verizon network. you can find the actual verizon store by looking for the location on the verizon wireless web site. the reason you need to go to the corporate store is they can reach into the bag of tricks behind the counter and pull out a nano sim card - which it needs (free), and they can also manually add your phone (new sim installed) to the verizon network. if they tell you they can't then leave. that person has obviously been infected with a mind phage which has destroyed his honesty, motivation, and initiative gene. i did not have to root this phone to enable wifi hotspot. if you use google apps - (mail, cloud drive, calendar etc.) this phone is for you. the battery lasts for a while, the screen looks nice, it has buttons that do stuff, and if you yell at it google will ask you what you just said. my cat found the nexus 6 phone to be an excellent item to sleep on. i'm not too sure why though - it seems like it would be somewhat uncomfortable, however i guess i cannot speak for my cat - who doesn't really care what i think. anyway, back to the nexus 6 phone - it has other things that are like little pictures on the screen. if you touch them you may win some candy. if you do not win candy you may be asked to input some form of information. there are other things you can do with this phone - like listen to music, watch tv on it .  seriously .  who watches a movie on their phone? like who does that? it will kill the battery in about 40 min - and the display is so small it is impossible to see what is going on. i guess people do it. there are other things and stuff you can do as well but meh .  you'll figure it out .   nexus 6 is the best android cell phone i've ever used. "pure google" as they say. it's powerful, lollipop 5.x, no bloat ware, and feels svelte in your hand. i like it. my only complaint is the cases available for it are very plastic-y .   absolutely loving this phone. great device .   i have been a nexus user for a while, but i have up my nexus 4 at the end of last year for an htc one m8. after a few months i really missed the nexus experience, so i sold the htc and got this nexus 6. this is the best phone that i've ever had and would be real close to perfect if the battery just lasted longer. it usually makes it through the day, but i would like to see a couple of days of use with a battery as large as the one on this phone .   great phone. love the size and speed. delivered promptly and safely .   absolutely great phone. some may not like the size of the huge screen but i personally love it. display is great, battery life is pretty good (not the best, but not terrible) and the performance is quick and snappy. the only problem i have with it is that the screen gets this weird pinkish hue at lower brightness levels. also, the phone comes with encryption enabled but unfortunately does not use hardware to do it. so, while the phone does perform well it doesn't perform to its maximum capability due to the extra strain on the processor from the encryption. otherwise though, a great device that i would definitely recommend to those who aren't scared off by a bigger screen .   how can you go wrong with a nexus device? clean interface, no carrier or manufacturer crapware. battery life was better then my note 3. only problem? no otterbox or lifeproof cases because it is a niche device .   after having several android devices (nexus 4-5, htc m7, oneplus one, motorola x 2013), i found the nexus 6 to be quiet boring and it stutters a lot with lollipop running at 5.1.1 version. even with the beast guts it feels laggy compared to other devices. i would go back to my oneplus one or get a sony z3 or moto x2014 and save up the difference .   i want to clarify for all those who are asking, i purchased the 32gb white nexus 6. if purchased from amazon, the model i received is the xt1103. i am a verizon customer, and was able to take my existing activated nano sim from previous phone and drop it into the nexus 6, the phone activated instantly with full 4g lte functionality. absolutely love the phone. if the size doesn't bother you ( which, why would you be here if it did), and you must have the vanilla android experience, complete with oem bootloader unlock. then this is the phone for you .   pretty good, only complaint are position of the volume buttons and occasional overheating. i found that the volume buttons are always getting in the way when i need to grab the device. it is also a nuisance if you need to clamp the device using a vehicle windshield mount. mine has to be manually modified to fit the phone. during charging and sometimes when a lot of things are going on the phone trends to heat up quite a bit. last thing is the curved back although aesthetically pleasing prevents interactions with the device lying flat on the table. using the key pad this way is cumbersome and error prone. this also leads to instability when mounted using those conventionally designed windshield mounts .   phone arrived early, as described, brand-new, and in perfect working order. i ordered the 32gb white colored model and i'm using it unlocked on a gsm carrier in the us. works brilliantly. the device itself is fast, and connects to networks with no problems. i'm happy with the purchase and got a really great deal .   love it .  so much better than my iphone .   premium feel and hasty updates .   i'll have a difficult time ever returning to a smaller display after using this device .   another quality product futon motorola paired with the google pure android experience. the only drawback i've good is limited accessories .   actually a great tablet .   nice smart phone and great os but the voice recognition is weak. edit: now that i have my real nexus 6 from google i can say that what i got from this order was actually nothing like it at all. the basic shape and form are different - the buttons are not the same, it takes a different sized sd card. maybe there was just some mix up in shipping? ------ this is not a normal, unlocked nexus 6 - it is not even branded as a nexus at all. it comes with a lot of apps and app folders that cannot be removed from the desktop and i'm not even sure if it will work with my t-mobile sim card. frankly i didn't try too hard given how ugly and inflexible the interface was - and who knows how much spyware might be on it. i only bought through amazon instead of google directly because i wanted prime shipping, well now i have to send it back and then order from google, so, fail .   i was using a samsung siii and compared to the power and how long the batteries lasts its better in every way .   if your into pure android then this is the phone to get i just love it its the best android phone i have used so far, must say battery life is weak but supper charge feature makes up for it. switching from iphone to android. i'm only about a month into having it. pros: great camera, bought it right before vacation in hawaii, love the quality of the photos i took fantastic large screen, awesome for video apps and watching movies plenty of storage solid manufacturing, feels nice and bulky like the size suggests battery charge is awesome, (compared to iphone) can go an entire day off full charge and not worry about having to charge games run smooth, downloaded a few high hardware requiring games and they run smooth cons: can take awhile to get used to the size can't get 4g after talking to at&t because i didn't buy it through them front facing camera is lacking take the size into account, doesn't fit easily into pockets default messaging app is garbage, can't send mms, had to hit the app store for a better one (it came with ads), imessage is better sometimes crashes long load up (but if you keep it charged it's not an issue) pricey, not sure if it's worth the pricetag buying it without an upgrade all in all i'm pretty happy with it after switching from apple. if you have the money i'd say it's worth it, but i feel you're really paying for the size. i love having video on my phone. however, i feel you can get the same quality camera and battery life on some other android phones. i'd suggest going to your phone store and playing around with the options .   the phone is big, but managable. the processor is incredibly fast, and the user interface is great. i was a little nervous about using a device with native android software, but it actually seems to work better than the loaded down versions that you get with other brands. one of the best features of this unlocked phone is that it will work on any network, cdma or gsm. i am so glad to have this phone and wonder how i tolerated previous phones with all the bloat ware that they all have embedded .   there is much to love about the nexus 6. the screen, though a little "warmer" than i prefer, is exceptionally sharp and readable, even in direct daylight. it's flat out fast, performing without lag under most circumstances. 64gig of ram is plenty for me. stock android is a benefit, as i had the 5.1.1 os on the phone as soon as it was released to the public. the camera, though not the "best" on the market, is by no means "bad." if you want a comprehensive, unbiased review, check out any of the major phone review sites like gsmarena or phonearena. so why did i dock it a star? battery life is flat out bad. even when sitting idle, i would often see the battery drain 5% in a half-hour. under "normal" use, (screen off, listening to music), the battery drained far too quickly, often 10% an hour. if i checked the battery drain page in the settings app, i would not see high drain numbers for anything but the screen, which was rarely on. also, google has to get lollipop under control. even the 5.1.1 version required frequent reboots. it was not unusual to require a forced reboot to get the phone to come back to life after particularly memory intensive process. i suspect a memory leak of some kind, but can't narrow it down. the camera is fine for daylight shooting, but is simply not "flagship" quality. in low light situations it was often hunting for focus and the resulting images (even with hdr+) were too grainy as to be usable. samsung hits a home run with its cameras. not sure why motorola can't get it straight. then there is the real challenge .   if you have small hands, think twice. it was virtually impossible for me to comfortably handle this phone without using two hands. in short, i "wanted" to love this phone, but in the end it simply did not work for me. i can't dock it more than 1 star, because most of the challenges i faced were not "defects," per se, but ergonomic choices that simply didn't fit my needs and goals. i've become spoiled by the ease of lgs back-of-phone buttons, a weird placement that took me time to adjust to at first but have now become so comfortable i find myself pressing the back of the phone by instinct no matter which phone i pick up. bottom line .   at a reduced price, and as long as you are ready for the huge screen, unwieldy ergonomics, and less-than-flagship camera, it is a solid phone. it's just not a phone for everybody. pros: solid screen solid performance huge memory stock android cons: less-than-flagship camera android 5.1.1 still requires too-frequent reboots screen is very large (caveat emptor) battery life is not worth the price of entry lack of expansion slots, lack of removable battery. camera terrible .  pink yello hue when dimmed .  cant see phone well in sunlight .  too pricey for too many minor problems .  otherwise 6 inches is nice but really heavy awkward phone and since its curved it rotates on table will not lay flat. the nexus 6 is an amazing smartphone. the display is big, bright and crisp. the cameras take flawless pictures and video. lte and an all day battery keep me going wherever i am. the processor makes android lollipop scream and with 64 gb of onboard storage, i'm never at a loss for space for music, photos and whatnot. there's just one caveat: that gorgeous display comes at a price. the device itself is big. really big. so big that i find myself reverting back to my nexus 5 unless i know i'm going to need to take great pictures or need the use of an all day battery. but now that the price has come down, it was worth it to buy one. and i got it in white! bonus .   so far so good. i'm running stock lollypop 5.1.1. this phone is butter smooth. screen is bright and clear. battery lasts all day, charges from 15 to 60 percent in 20 min. i'm running on t-mobile and have wifi calling capability .   great phone - amazing screen. super fast. pure android. love everything but its just a little too big. it does not fit well in my pocket where i usually carry my phone. no other complaints .   couldn't ask for a better android phone .   just got it around 1 week, it droped from my car (around 40cm), and got broken screen/glass. it's so fragile. my htc and iphone 6+ which also have big screen, they came aross simliar situations, but no problem at all. will never recommond nexus series to anyone else .   i have owned many premium android devices from various manufacturers. everything is great other than i am used to the samsung experience (minus the bloatware). i do not have anything negative to say for someone that likes the google-branded android experience .   ok, so it also happens to be the only 6 inch phone ever made. minor technicality. the only real competitor might be the sony z ultra from 2 years ago. but that is 6.4 inches, not 6! i've had it for 5 days and so far it's the best phone i've had. no stutters, or lag anywhere so far, but this usually takes time as you add more apps and more stuff starts to run in the background. not all of my apps were automatically reinstalled from google, which is odd since it worked on all the previous phones. at the same time this gives me a fresh start so it's not a big deal. the 6 inch screen is fantastic. it's definitely the right size for me. so far it fits in to the front pockets of all my pants and jeans. i will say that i like pants with good size pockets though. just for reference, i have a note 3 for work and i can keep both the note 3 and the n6 in one front pocket. however, that is one bulging pocket! so now each pocket has a phone in it. for work i usually wear banana republic chinos. i think a 1080p screen would have been fine, but the 2k screen is excellent. i thought the colors might be a bit over-saturated, but they're very well balanced. the blacks, of course, are fantastic. the front facing speakers are also excellent. i don't think quite as good as the m8/m9, but significantly better than everything else out there, although i haven't heard the sony z3 yet and i've read a lot of good things about it as well. the camera is also quite good. it's a big step up from the camera in my xperia z, in particular with the auto settings. i haven't gotten in to the manual settings yet and i can't tell if there are any. but that was the best way to shoot with the z, the auto always used a really high iso setting which always made noisy images. no issues with noise yet with a few pics i've taken. the auto settings handle back lighting much better than the z and better than the note 3 camera. other reasons i decided on the n6. 1. i'm no tmo and this phone has band 12 support. so as the network re-farm continues i'll eventually get better building coverage. 2. project fi. i'm also considering switching over the project fi. i'm still on the fence about this since i think at most it would save me $20/month on service and i'd have a lower priority on the network. but recently i pretty consistently use less than 3 gb/month and some months were only 1 gb. so i could save a couple bucks .   coming from an aging nexus 4 i expected a pretty dramatic upgrade. however what i received was a phone with the worse display( the screen is tinted orange, invisible in daylight, and just dingy and not bright.) but its faster right? well slightly. despite having significantly better hardware software encryption hobbles it tremendously. it can't be turned off. additionally the bluetooth is very poor and the music cuts out constantly. the battery life is slightly better than the nexus 4 with an old worn out battery. that makes me a little nervous but the battery will be completely unacceptable within a year. one bright. is it the image sensor for the camera is dramatically better. does the flash power is extremely weak. skip this phone and wait for whatever is coming out next .   from nexus 5 to nexus 6. i love this thing. huge but you get used to it .   excelent, everything ok, very fast. short version: ---------------------------- you may not be able to know for sure if you will get the xt1103 (model 00630nartl) or the xt1100 (model sm4034aw4n3) when you purchase this phone on amazon. i bought one for myself (sold directly from amazon) and then bought one for my wife about a month later (sold from deltamobiles via amazon). i got the xt1103 us model on the first order (from amazon), then got the xt1100 international/euro model on the second order (from deltamobiles). this is a problem because the xt1100 cannot use 3g or lte on my carrier (consumer cellular, which piggybacks on the at&t network) or on virtually any other us cellular carrier. so even though i went back into my amazon order history and purchased the second nexus 6 using the same product page as the first that i bought, the second was a different model that will not be able to utilize high-speed data. see the photo attached to this review which shows both boxes side-by-side. i am returning the xt1100 and i bought my wife another nexus 6 directly from the google store to be sure i will get an xt1103 that is set up for us data networks (it was the same price as amazon when i bought it just now). i use amazon all the time for all kinds of things, but in this case i would recommend that you avoid purchasing a nexus 6 through amazon unless it is clear exactly which model you're going to receive. you are supposed to get an xt1103 when you buy the phone on this product page - note that in the technical details section on the product page it specifically has "00630nartl" as the item model number, which is the us-compatible xt1103, so if you get an xt1100 (model sm4034aw4n3) you are getting the wrong phone. i am suspicious that deltamobiles is purposely sending people the wrong phone. long version: ---------------------------- i love this phone. this is my first android phone after three iphones and i couldn't be happier. i love the huge, bright screen, the camera is pretty nice, the phone is fast, and lte is awesome. but here's why i wrote this review: i purchased my nexus 6 on may 7th, 2015. it shipped from amazon (in other words it says "ships from and sold by amazon.com" under the price on the amazon product page), and i got the xt1103, which is the us model. it only took a few minutes to set it up on my service (consumer cellular, which piggybacks on the at&t network), and it hooked up to lte immediately. you probably already know this if you are shopping for a high-end smartphone, but lte (aka 4g lte) is the most recent high-speed data network. it means faster downloading, web browsing, etc. and is one of the major benefits of upgrading to a new phone if your current phone is not lte-capable. my wife was jealous of my new, giant, beautiful phone, which is understandable since i intentionally showed it off to her all the time and often suggested the inferiority of her old iphone (which was a hand-me-down from when i made my previous iphone upgrade). so for our anniversary, i bought her a nexus 6 as well (purchased on june 16th, 2015 - a little over a month from when i bought mine). i gave it to her today, and then started setting it up for her. everything in the setup went normally just like it had with my phone, but when i disabled the wi-fi to test the data network, i noticed that her phone was not connecting to lte (or 3g for that matter). i set both our phones side by side and checked the apn settings and some other phone settings to verify that they were set up identically, which they were. i had only taken the phone itself out of the box up to this point, and when i removed the rest of the contents i saw the european plug on the phone's charger. i compared the box of her phone to mine (see attached photo) and finally realized by looking at the labels that my wife's nexus 6 was the xt1100 (euro/international model), and that i had gotten the xt1103 (the us version). while the xt1100 looks identical, has an identical os, uses the same nano sim card, etc., it has a very different setup in terms of compatible cellular networks and will not use us 3g or lte. note that the xt1100 will still work for making calls and using basic cellular data (gsm), but you will not be able to access 3g or lte. i was pretty certain that i had bought my wife's nexus 6 from the exact same product page on amazon from which i had purchased my own, so i went back into my order history to verify this. both of the orders do point to the same product page, but the first order (xt1103 us model) was sold by amazon, while the second order (xt1100 international model) was shipped/sold by deltamobiles. currently (june 20th), the product page says it is being sold/shipped by amazon again. i didn't even realize that it was a different seller when i made the second purchase. this situation is pretty frustrating because nobody buying this phone to use it in the us would likely choose the international model instead of the us model since the international model will not perform as well on us networks, so i don't know why they are sending the xt1100 to us customers. because the seller (deltamobiles) covered the sm4034aw4n3 model number on the box with a separate tag (see the photo attached to this review) i became a little suspicious that they are intentionally sending people the wrong phone because many people may not know that the xm1100 is the wrong phone. after all, it is a genuine nexus 6, it will place phone calls in the us, and it will be able to use cellular data, so many people may start using it and never realize (or only realize too late) that they've gotten the wrong phone that can't use the much faster 3g and 4g data networks. if it is possible for a seller to make a little more money by sending the xt1100 to customers in the us than by sending them the correct xm1103, i bet this would explain why deltamobiles is sending out the wrong phone. for your reference, these are the compatible networks for the two versions of the phone: xt1103 (model 00630nartl) : gsm: 850/900/1800/1900 mhz cdma band class: 0/1/10 wcdma bands: 1/2/4/5/8 lte bands: 2/3/4/5/7/12/13/17/25/26/29/41 ca dl bands: b2-b13, b2-b17, b2-29, b4-b5, b4-b13, b4-b17, b4-b29 xt1100 (model sm4034aw4n3) gsm: 850/900/1800/1900 mhz wcdma bands: 1/2/4/5/6/8/9/19 lte bands: 1/3/5/7/8/9/19/20/28/41 ca dl bands: b3-b5, b3-b8 and if you put the search term "list of lte networks" into google, you can go to a wikipedia page that will show you all of the individual networks and what bands they use for lte .   i love this phone. big bright clear screen. fast processor. lollipop 5.0. very happy so far .   so i really love this phone, the feel, the screen, the system, everything about it basiclly. the only i really don't love is the size. however i'm sure that will change as i continue to use it more and more. however the one real issue i had with the phone is the software it shipped with is build lnx07m which a developers build and not a production build. this means i was not eligible for ota updates and manually had to update it. however since it was a nexus this was a fairly painless process and once it was over i really got back to enjoying the phone. amazing phone, almost perfect .   this is the best phone in the world, you will always get the newest android release since this is google branded device, is actually a hi end device, it works smoothly and flawless, pretty nice feature the fast charger, i never get out of juice when i'm out, i just need to connect my device for a few minutes and is ready to carry a few more hours. there is no downsize on it .   all was delivered as expected and on time. no complaints. ii is one of the best choice i've made in recent memory. the nexus 6, is not just a phone to me .   the unit i received has sound issues. static all over the place. the volume during calls is also very low. probably ok if you are alone at home, but i was in a grocery store and had issues understanding what i was told. the screen is also bad. the resolution is ok. but the colors are just awful. yellow is the new white! i had heard about amoled screen being overly warm, but this is just wrong .   i really hope the next phone (hopefully la nexus 5 2015 later this year) will have an ips screen. the screen is also too big to my taste but still usable. let's say i'm not impressed. and it's clearly not worth the 580 i paid for. but i need a new phone and other flagships are just way more expensive so .   i ordered a replacement because of the sound issue anyway. i hope the screen will be better .   ecxelent. international version .   i love the freedom of unlocked phones when combined specially with t-mobile. the nexus 6 is hard to beat and for the current price is even a better bargain. doesn't have all the bloatware of carrier phones and the software updates come directly from google with not much waiting like you would have to from the carrier software testing. the phone performs almost to the level of a note 4 but again the nexus 6 is clean android without having to root it like a note 4 would have to be .   works like a dream. big screen. big battery. big sound. what's not to love? works with verizon and gsms as well .   phone is perfect .   i love it. pure android and it is project fi enabled now. good bye verizon, hello to cheap phone bill .   thank you so much for the brand new phone. and thanks for the quick delivery. update: two weeks later i'm happy i bought the phone. it is large for one hand, but i'm still happy i purchased it .   great phone, i was skeptical about the size, but after a week you get use to it, and i am not going back to a smaller phone, watching videos and browsing internet is fantastic for a mobile device. the next generation google nexus might not be made by motorola anymore. if you want a good motorola phone, this is the best phone to get .   best android phone i've ever had. big screen easy to read easy to use. no bloatware absolutely love it .   bought open box item. perfect so far, no complaints here .   decent phone, fast and good screen. the cons are: * too huge. even compared with other devices with similar screen size. * buttons in the middle make it really awkward to use it as a gps nav in a car - since most cradles hold the phone by the sides, so they tend to cover those buttons or even worse - constantly press them on every bump. * too huge .   i've owned a lot of smartphones over the years, from iphone, windows & android phones .  this nexus 6 is by far the best phone i've ever used! stock android is so beautiful & easy to navigate! the screen is big & coming from a samsung galaxy s5, i thought might be too big .  but it's not! it feels perfect in my hands & that curved back makes holding this phone excellent! the software combined with the hardware makes this phone function so smoothly without any glitches & apps just fly open & close fast too! i'm a light to medium user & i'm getting 2 full days (easily) from this battery! actually, when i went to bed last night, it was the 3rd full day without a charge & phone was still on 24% when i plugged it in! motorola/google nailed this phone in my opinion .   nexus devices are becoming my favorites so much, that i just ditched my gen 3 ipad for a nexus 9 tablet by htc .  i do not miss apple products whatsoever .   p.s. front facing speakers are a must for me now after 5 years of ipads .   #####update may 2016##### after having this phone for 1 year now .  i still love it with one caveat .  my nexus 6 will not get updates for software .  apps will update though. i'm still on lollipop 5.0.1 & use cricket wireless .  i've talked with motorola, google nexus & cricket about this, & no help whatsoever. google said the only way to ensure updates is to buy from the google play store. (i think this is ridiculous as all the phones are manufactured by motorola for google nexus .  how can they pick & choose which phones are updated?) so i've missed out on lollipop 5.1 & marshmallow 6.0 now .  i know i can download & install the factory images, but i just don't feel comfortable doing it & it's somewhat confusing to me, plus i was warned it could cause issues too .   amazing .   article i bought was midnight blue version but instead got the white version without headphones  .   frustrating. wonderfullllll. i liked this device. it isn't that big as i thought .   i use this phone everyday on verizon in nh. max full bar speed test result was 65 mbps down, but rarely get full bars, usually 1 less. phone itself is big but thats what i wanted. i dont hold this to my head as a phone very often but it can feel silly when i talking on it since its so large. charger makes an awful whine when done charging. battery life gets you through the day but still have to charge nightly. wifi tethering doesnt work like it did for my nexus 4, but maybe the difference is tmobile vs verizon. i would buy this phone again, but it is not as amazing as i thought it would be. screen size is nice, but in terms of performance its a disappointing upgrade over iphone 4s considering how much it cost even though i prefer android. i am using this with my grandfathered unlimited data plan. note on activation: this was not easy to get working on verizon but it does work as of april, 2015. first verizon store i went to in the mall refused to help me since the imei number was not in the database. they offered to sell me another one. i have some words amazon will not let me print for them. second verizon store was a stand alone store which was rather busy when i went. 30ish minute wait, 30ish minutes to activate, but after that it did work. the manager had a senior tech use the floor model to activate a new sim card (i did not have one in my previous non-lte phone) for my number then transferred the sim card to my phone. if i sign into my verizon website it shows im using and unknown device, but it works fine .   nice and goooood. i love my nexus 6. i love the white back it just stands out way way more then the standard blue that everyone else gets from their carrier. super fast, amazing screen (not so great in sunlight sadly), two day battery life for me (a medium user), and all the apps i need for both work and play .   this works with verizon, you just have to move your sim from old phone to new phone. if your sim is too big, just cut down your old sim card to fit this slot. i know it sounds crazy, but it works as long as you don't cut it too small. i took the sim from my s4, cut it down with an exact knife, then put it into this and it works fine. it shows up as "unrecognized" device in my verizon wireless online profile, but who cares. i still have full unlimited data and lte/calls/text all work great .   fast, nice screen, charges quickly, battery last a lot at least more than my nexus 5, sometimes i feels is so big but so far this is a good piece of hardware. google please you should lower the price .   larger size basically makes my tablet obsolete, overall fast, about ~8hr screen on time and the display is bright enough to be used outside. only downside is the display. as a user of a calibrated wide gamut lcd display i know what proper colors should look like and this display is horribly off. an example, 255 red 0 green 0 blue looks more like a dark blood orange than red. also if you look a the display off center, the color shifts to a greenish color .   have used it for 2 months now, best android phone i have ever used. pros: 1) good battery backup 2) display 3) speed cons: 1) does not connect to wifi hotspot. same android version works correctly in my old nexus 5 phone. works correctly with usual wifi, but not wifi hotspot. cannot figure out why. 2) little bulkier to use with 1 hand .   the best experience with raw google lollipop. coming from a galaxy s4, this phone is night and day. never will i return to the touchwiz interface that samsung spoils android with. the camera and display on the phone are fantastic. could be a hair better, but still an improvement over my old phone and above par of most current phones. while the phone is huge, it really doesn't take long before the 5.9 inches feels normal. overall, i think this phone is the best complete package. it might not have ground breaking individual specs and all the useless features, but it provides the best overall experience .   big screen and fast, but camera is not as good. ip6, ssg is better. very solid phone. good. arrived in good condition. phone works well .   been using samsung's for years thought i would try native android on motorola's flagship device. everything requires an app. battery percentage, unread sms followup reminders. in addition to the phone not ringing at times and not giving notifications at times and at other times the speakers sounded blown. the gps was inaccurate at times. my spouse and i have an app that can locate the others phone. when he was shown to be in the middle of a quarry's private land but was really 7 miles away that was the final straw. the vendor was great to work with, the problem is with the phone hardware and native software. returned them both and got samsung note 4's. i hope your experience is better than ours .   i am a heavy phone user. i had to charge this phone 3 times a day. it was also big and heavy. i'm using a note edge now, which feels much lighter and holds a charge all day. i've had this phone for about 2 months now. here are my thoughts: yes, its big. i'm not sure what kind of pants people are wearing who say it won't fit in their pockets. i have a minimal case on mine, fits in every pocket i've tried. the size is a plus in my opinion. after 2 days using this thing, pick up a "normal" sized phone, like an iphone 5. you'll wonder how people use such a dinky device to get things done. the nexus 6 is top notch. android lollipop is beautiful, fast and clean. you don't have to wait for carrier updates, you won't get bloatware or overlays, this is pure android. for some people, that may not matter. for me, it's a huge plus. i also like that the colors really pop on the screen. it's definitely a little more saturated than some of the other screens out there. sound is also great. you won't realize how good the dual front facing speakers really are until you watch netflix or listen to spotify on this. battery life gets knocked on this phone a lot. i generally average between 4 to 4.5 hours of actual screen on time, no matter what i throw at it. that is perfectly acceptable. especially considering i keep the screen brightness maxed at all times. also, this thing charges very fast. the camera is good, not the best out there, but you'll be able to snap great pictures (and 4k video!) with this. no complaints. i guess my only small gripe is the screen could be a bit brighter. i like my screens to be blindingly bright, and although this is very bright, there are phones available that are a little brighter. with its high end specs and stock android, i think this phone is absolutely worth the price tag. also, i'm using straight talk with this. no problems there, either. hope this review helps .   i had used nexus 5 for a year. it was a great phone. the on/off button started giving me problems, so, since i already had the phone for a year, i "upgraded" to nexus 6 a month ago. not a good thing. two days ago it started heating up, i turned it off. then, it just cannot be turned off without having to hard reset the thing to be able to use it again. do not buy this phone! on top of it, motorola's customer service is horrible! basically, if you have a problem, they're nice to you, but cannot help you. you have to send the phone for repairs, to see if they fix it, or give you a new one. and there you go: 1 month with no phone .   google nexus 6 is the best phone on the market! no bloatware, not tied to carrier updates, and it's all google branding. smooth as silk navigation, great transitions, powerful processor, and plenty of ram. nexus is king of the field .   third replacement and still came scratched out of the box. packaging was awful .   excellent mobile but it's little big, accepted. great phone .   not a good quality product, crashes all the time. had to buy the carrier version 32g plebian version. bit very beautiful fone .  powerhouse if i were being honest. yes .   it is the phone which is worth to be got .   i like it very much .   the phone is very good, the screen is good,the camera is good, but the battery is problem, i need charge 2 times one day. i come from nokia 800c, the nexus 6 is so big and it is hard to make phone call using one hand .   great phone .   very good phone and fast delivery .   best phone ever. google does it right .   works great .   had no issue getting verizon to get the sim issue resolved .   i love it, i' m fan of the nexus devices, since the galaxy nexus. this for me is the best phone in the market made for one is the best brands as motorola .   i had the nexus 5 for over a year and it was the best smartphone i've ever had. fast, pure android-driven and my only complain was the camera that didn't work too well at night. i was anxious to get my hands on the following nexus 6, but couldn't find anywhere other amazon or google play store itself. when it finally arrived, i was surprised by it's huge size and the fact that is actually a phablet, not a phone. too big to carry on your pocket and too big to type with one hand only. despite all the upgrades from nexus 5 (which are really good), it's size really bothers me and after 1 month using it i still regret it. specially if you consider that it's price is comparable to other fantastic android phones out there that still fit in your hands and pockets. if you are looking for a nexus 6, i highly recommend you go to the nearest store and see it for yourself first .   great price and fast delivery. the phone was a little large at first but i quickly adjusted. after having the nexus 6 for about a month i am really happy with the quality and features .   i hated my at&t branded samsung galaxy s4. the last straw was at&t pushing out some compulsory news app that kept sending notifications to my android wear watch. the bloatware is out of control. so far i love the nexus 6. everything just works. there is no bloat. i can uninstall any apps that i want. i was worried about the size, this is a big phone. it fits into my pocket just fine and the bigger screen is great for ebooks and graphic novels. possibly interesting to some people. i found the samsung s4-android 4.4 behavior annoying. samsung s4-android 4.4: music playing and headphones plugged in -> turn on car -> bluetooth connects -> music plays through headphones -> turn off car -> music plays through headphones. nexus 6-android 5.1: music playing and headphones plugged in -> turn on car -> bluetooth connects -> music plays through car speakers -> turn off car -> music plays through headphones .   i love this phone! i decided to buy unlocked in case i decide to travel overseas, i can buy a prepaid sim and have a phone basically anywhere. coming from a galaxy s4, it's taken me a little while to get used to stock android, but it's nice not having to wait for a carrier or a manufacturer to approve their own modifications to the os before pushing them to the handset. only comes with google's applications installed, no other software or bloatware! the battery still lasts me about a day (24 hours) with moderate use. a little less with heavier use, but not so much that i end up without power before i get home for the night. charging with the stock adapter is really quick as well. as a precautionary note, however, it was a real pain for me to get this activated with verizon. if you don't already have a nano sim card through them, you'll probably have to either go through best buy, or get in touch with verizon's it department (not customer service) to get your number transferred to a compatible sim. it will work on their network, despite what they try to tell you. i ended up having to pay an extra $20 for the sim, but my phone works perfectly ever since. not too much to not be tethered to a single carrier .   good phone .   bad service. for all those who complain that the size is too big, for me it fits comfortable in my hands. love the keyboard and how fast it is. it takes a little time to get used to the size. but believe me, it's just right .   first impressions: i've been a nexus fan for a few years now because of the stock android experience. i previously had a nexus 4 and after that an iphone 6 but i missed the versatility of android so i started looking at a replacement for the iphone 6. i know the first thought on most of your minds is wow that phone is just too big. well i can tell you now that its not as bad as you think. motorola has done some intelligent things with the physical design to make the phone easier to hold such as having a curved back and small lips on the edges for grip. the best thing to do would be to go into a phone store and hold it for yourself but i can tell you that it's a lot more manageable than i previously thought before i owned one. i love it and i'm about to tell you why. screen : so obviously the screen is big but how does it look ?unfortunately this is one area where the phone could use some slight refinement. now don't get me wrong the screen looks really good it's extremely sharp and the colors really pop. but the display has a slightly warm bias and color accuracy is better on other displays such as the iphone and the galaxy note series and its especially noticeable on plain white backgrounds because they end up being slightly grey or cream colored. is it a deal breaker ? absolutely not and i am confident you can get used to it because i did after only a few days. it's important to keep in mind as well that this is all preference some people do prefer warm biased displays which are arguably better for content like games and movies. i would have to say as well that this display is not particularly bright and may be difficult to see outside for most people except on its highest brightness settings. pixel density is also obviously up to todays standards as this phone has a quad hd screen. text is as sharp as you'd ever need it to be and i guarantee you aren't seeing any individual pixels on this display unless you smash your face against it. but quad hd has some trade offs too. all those pixels contribute to faster battery drain than phones with 1080p displays and graphics performance would be slightly better if the gpu didn't have to push all those pixels. overall it is a very nice display but i think it could have gotten by with a 1080p display without most people being any the wiser. performance: this phone is simply one of the fastest you can get but with the snapdragon 805 inside you wouldn't expect anything less. a 2.7 ghz quad core krait 450 cpu, adreno 420 gpu and 3gb of lpddr3 ram are the driving force in this beast. everything is extremely fast from opening apps to web browsing and its also partly to do with stock android as well. apps almost always open instantly and menu navigation is very smooth. i do get the occational stutters and glitches while exiting or moving between apps but these cases were few and far between and i mostly attribute that to android 5 still being somewhat new because this isnt the only lollipop device that seems to have that problem. gaming is one area this phone really shines as well giving you very good frame rates across the board. battery life is good but it could be better. i have no trouble making it through the whole day with the brightness at 60-70% with moderate to heavy use. usually i end the day close to 50% left so it definitely will get you through a day and maybe a half but phones like the note 4 and iphone 6 plus can beat it in this category. the good news is that the charger included with the phone is extremely fast. i have been able to get 40% battery from only 25 minutes of charging so that may help alleviate the good but not great battery endurance. there's no 64 bit architecture here and some phones already have lpddr4 ram in them but if you're worried about the longevity of this phone don't be because it has some very future proof specs. and while battery life isn't the best it definitely competes well with other premium phones. software: so chances are if the giant screen wasn't your main interest in this phone then stock android was and for good reason too. android 5.1 is the current version as of this writing and google has fixed some of the bugs that plagued 5.0 so stability has improved noticeably. i have to say honestly that lollipop is by far the fastest mobile os i have ever used and aesthetically its appealing too. menu navigation is easier than ever and it just feels more cohesive than other versions of android. menus and notifications always come from somewhere now rather than just appearing or disappearing and its especially noticeable with the drop down menu where you access things like setting and wifi or bluetooth switches. also being that this is a nexus device you won't find any bloatware. nope only some google apps and other thing necessary to the phones functionality. the only downside to lollipop is that not all apps are compatible. i had trouble getting many older apps to even open at all but newer apps or apps from bigger budget devs should already be up to date and work just fine. but for some people using old and/or obscure apps, this may be a big problem or even a deal breaker. in conclusion if you want a stock android experience that's always up to date with the latest version and performs very well with the exception of some older or not as popular apps not opening, then this is a great choice. what its best at: the name of the game here is media consumption. movies, games, books, youtube, web browsing and photo viewing all benefit from the extra screen size as well as productivity apps. the slightly warm screen color bias actually really looks great with movies and gaming especially, with colors really looking outstanding. this phone really is great for gaming especially. i never felt like the controls of any game i played were cramped at all like other phones and emulators work great. it makes playing games like worms 2 armageddon especially easier to play and see what's going on onscreen due to the characters being so tiny depending on how zoomed in the screen is. books as you can imagine are a great fit for the screen as its almost the size of a small book. its one of the only phones i've ever enjoyed reading on due to the size. you can even get away with loading desktop versions of web sites but even mobile sites really benefits from the large display as well. this phone is great for power users as well because its essentially a blank canvas for custom roms and without much bloatware, performance will stay consistently high for the whole time you'll own the phone. the only downsides for power users would be the lack of expandable storage and user replaceable battery which may be a deal breaker for some. conclusion: all in all this phone really is outstanding if a little rough around the edges. its big but manageable, it has great performance, good battery life, is exceptional for media consumption and while a little less refined than offerings from apple or samsung it excells in a way that no other phone has before. its a pure android powerhouse that's half tablet and half phone. a media consumption beast. it truly is a jack of all trades and may even be able to replace your need for a tablet. i think i might even say that overall this is my favorite phone i've ever owned. so whether you're craving a stock android experience, looking for a tablet replacement or just looking for something new or different, the nexus 6 is a dream for android purists and media junkies alike .   great customer service, respond very quickly. at first i thought the phone was not working but i get it to work now and it is amazing. it was a gift for my dad and he loves it .   this has been a great phone from day one. initially i was little skeptical about the features available in this model when compared to my htc one m7, but it took only a few hours to fiddle around with the stock lollipop os and soon i was very comfortable with what the phone had to offer. many people have stated the size of the phone as being a big concern, but this has bothered me the least. the phone feels really great while holding it and i do manage some one hand operations (though some need you to use two hands) in most daily use situations. the immersive 5.9 inch qhd display is a big plus to the phone and viewing videos or photos is a charm! the battery life comes to a day of moderate usage even with the 5.1 update and i have no problem whatsoever with the performance this phone delivers, it is fluid and seamless across all the applications. didn't like the stock android launcher on the phone and i now use nova launcher to add more customization on the phone (one of the things i hated with the google now launcher was the white color app drawer). the camera on the phone takes some time to focus and is not always accurate in low light. i am still looking for an app which can improve the camera to focus better and quicker. overall, really pleased with the ownership of this device for over a month now and would recommend for anyone looking to enjoy the stock android experience without all that bloatware from manufacturers .   not bad. a big phone .   i love the clean android without all the unwanted apps .   did i say this phone is big .   it will take some getting use to .   i received the product without problems. the cell is excellent, works better than i expected  .   excellent device. the size may be a little problem for some users. even though the device is fully compatible with verizon's network, verizon wireless wouldn't activate .   pros: nexus devices get the latest and greatest android, untouched as google intended it. camera is among the best in class for smartphones. cons: while it may be compact for a 6" screen device, it's still big and heavy. oled screen is great, but this is not the latest gen oled screen like samsung puts on the s6. qualcomm 805 cpu is built on 28nm tech, while state of the art is 14nm like in the galaxy s6 no fingerprint reader/login/security summary: it's the best android phone because the software comes from google without 3rd parties messing with it, but the hardware is not currently (5/2015) state of the art .   and for those who want a phone that fits in their pants pocket, this and any other 6" or 5.5" phone probably won't. advice: wait for a new nexus 5 or whatever they launch in the 2nd half of 2015 .   love this phone, finally a phone you can root and get early os updates on verizon. fast, great screen, ok camera, ok battery life. great phone, worth the investment. fast, speedy phone. great upgrade of my my galaxy note 2 .   fantastic phone, i'd never go back to another one. i like everything about this phone regardless size or battery life. but there are two down sides about this phone. one - it is surely not a budget phone, why they don't provide a headphone? two - screen color is amazing but when it dims to the lower, it seems to turn into red-ish. overall i love it .   it is the international version xt1100, great device from a good seller. thank you. thought it would be too large at first, but its just right size. the phone is working perfectly .   bit of background - although i'm partial to android i can appreciate the advantages of both apple and nexus product. i've had nexus phones from when nexus one came out. i like this phone but it doesn't 'wow' me. that said i had done my research and i got this phone because it's cross carrier compatibility. i wish motorola mobile division wasn't sold off and this phone would be made in usa but it's made in china. not really dinging it because of that but it doesn't help. the phone screen is big and that's good but any bigger and i would've gotten something else. the reason i really had to knock off 2 stars is 'cause of bluetooth issues. i started having issues from the get go after i got the 5.1 ota update. i hadn't connected the headset before the update so i don't know if it would've made any difference. third party apps can't be the culprit as i had the issue before installing any apps. the issues are related to signal strength and range. i've connected the same headset to multiple phone/tablet and the issues only appear when using with nexus 6. i've tried the troubleshooting steps listed on various websites which is mainly clearing cache and data to no avail. with the phone being this big, bluetooth connectivity is crucial. i'm considering sending the phone back even though it means time spent to setup the device will have been wasted. update 5/5 - after a dropped call i ordered a replacement. the replacement fails to update to 5.0.1. it downloads the update, reboots, tries and fails. i see an android lying on its back with "error" text over it. it then reboots and even after a factory restore fails to update. thinking whether to replace or return. i chose to give it one more shot .   everything perfect .   this is my new phone after an htc one x+, which i had for over 2 years. i liked it, except for the small, non-replaceable battery. the nexus 6 has a much larger screen, which my old eyes appreciate. it is very clear, and great for watching videos. the battery is much larger than my old phone, and i'm charging it every two to three days instead of at least once per day with the old phone. the turbo charger that comes with it is very fast. it gives you about 6 hours of use after only 15 minutes or so, and a full charge in about 2 hours. much faster than my old phone. note: i am not a power user at all. if most of your life revolves around your phone, your mileage may vary. i decided to get the unlocked version to eliminate a lot of the bloatware that at&t, and i suspect, the other carriers, load on the phone when you buy it from them. it comes with almost every google app already installed, and it is easy to get the apps you want to transfer from the old phone installed on the new one. just go to play/my apps on a computer and select the ones you want to transfer (unfortunately, one at a time) click on the "install" button (it tells you if the app is compatible of the new phone before you click on install) and it will be downloaded to the new phone. the phone is easy to use. there are a few things that are different with the motorola from the htc, but there is lots of info on the web about how to use the phone. i like it very much .   i have changed my lg g3 for this huge piece of work. i have being using this for 2 weeks so far so good. not happy yet with the lollipop. i'm also testing android car with a pioneer stereo, very good but very beta phase. i like the device. i'm not really happy with lollipop, but itself the motorola does his job. 32 gb storage might be a little bit short for this device. good luck for the new buyers .   buyer beware! 1. it was not made clear that this phone is the international version that will not work on t-mobile lte network in the us, although it does connect to hspa. since the turbo-charger is made in europe, the package includes an adapter for us electrical outlets. it would have been nice to have all this sufficiently explained up front. 2. also,this phone seems to have a problem charging on the qi wireless charger i have been using with other nexus 6 phones. 3. the back cover has tiny spots that cannot be washed off. this is annoying if you're expecting a brand new, pristine product. i am disappointed and i am returning this phone immediately .   its good. i am coming from a moto x (2013) which has a 4.7 in. screen and this was a big jump for me. at first it was a little intimidating the screen size and the overall form factor of the phone, but after a few days of use, i have gotten use the phone and love it. i have had it since saturday (4/4/15). it is a fast and smooth phone to use. what i like also is that not many people have it, especially in my group of friends. the only problem i have is that the camera, while its good, i do wish it could be better in low light conditions, but its passable. the other problem i had with it (its more of my pet-peeve) is the google now launcher that comes pre-installed with the phone. the beauty of android is that there are tuns of launcher options. i just downloaded apex launcher and it has looked better. i don't like the big icons that come with google now launcher .   the best phone ever. take care when ordering this on amazon, i have seen several postings of nexus 6s and noticed the "model number" labeled "model reference" and other attempts to obscure what you're actually buying. i ordered a nexus 6 xt1103, the north americas model. i received a nexus 6, mo. xt1100 international, which is useless in the states. i am not happy and will be returning the phone. *edit* after returning the phone and receiving the correct model i can say this is the phone for me and well worth the wait. my earlier complaint was misplaced frustration at a shipping error, and had little relevance to the phone, which is fantastic. huge, fast and beautiful. highly recommended .   i ask for 2 phones, everything was ok ,but one of them has now a broken pixel (in the 2nd week) and it does not cast video through my chrome-cast i don't know why, my other phones does that just ok .   i have owned every flagship and "phablet" you can think of. this has been my absolute favorite. it has a wonderful blend of specs, size, manageability, speed and battery life. if you are thinking about getting a big phone this should be it. the front facing speakers are a great bonus .   battery life could be better, everything else i like .   i've owned a nexus one, a nexus 4, and now this nexus 6. like most people, i was concerned about how big this phone is. i've owned it for two weeks, and now the nexus 4 just feels tiny. the important things most people will care about are as follows: the screen is beautiful, and big. watching videos, taking pictures, or texting is easy with that much real estate to deal with. the sound quality of the calls is superb, and the dual speakers are phenomenally good. i went with the 64gb model (blue), found cases and holsters aplenty here on amazon, and couldn't be happier with this phone. i use a bluetooth headset and a sony smartwatch 2, because even with the nexus 4, you don't have to pull your phone out every time it alerts you to a new facebook message, text, phone call or email. when it does come out, you're able to watch clear crisp video, hear amazing audio, and browse the web incredibly fast. the battery life (under lollipop 5.1) is also very good. i used to have to charge the nexus 4 every night, and the nexus 6 can go days without a charge at normal (not heavy internet/video use) use. i highly recommend this phone to anyone. the pure android experience coupled with 3 gb of ram, a fast 2.7 quad-core cpu, and the high quality of the display and the great sound? i can't think of anything bad about this phone .   great phone. it's fast and powerful. the screen is beautiful. the battery lasts forever. i like the design of the phone. google's equivalent of siri is amazing, i occasionally speak to my phone to find a place on a map or to text someone if i'm feeling lazy or wish to feel like a tool. concerning it's size: i am sitting down typing this with the phone in my pocket and don't even feel it. that said, it won't fit in skinny jeans, so you are going to have to make a choice in what you value more :) my complaints have more to do with the os with lots of small annoying things. there's no "enter" button on the sms keyboard, which sucks since i like to format my messages before i send them. sooo annoying .   the autocorrect is mediocre at best. the notifications cover stuff that i'm doing every now and then. not a huge deal, but i get mildly irritated every time things don't go perfectly well. i mean, it's $700, that's the price of a laptop. this stuff should have all been figured out. concerning the specs: on paper, this thing lays the smack-down on the iphone 6 plus's candy ass. don't get the iphone, it's a rip off compared to this magnificently stylish beast, while the android ecosystem is open and lets you do whatever you want with your phone. the drawback to not creating a vacuum / walled garden like apple is that their os's ux is inferior. i still would buy this phone 100 times over compared to the iphone. google, make your os better, and collect 5 stars .   best phone i've ever had .   the back cover was found cracked after i've used it less than a week. the quality control is so bad by motorola which was once well known for good quality management. it's so dispoint! i should buy a iphone at the beginning:(. the good: great battery life, easy to modify with custom recovery and root access, fast enough for aggressive multitasking, good audio/speaker quality, solid construction. the bad: too damn big, no sd card slot ( .  ), headphone volume is pathetically low. note: this is not a verizon authorized device, in that the imei number of the phone is not within verizon's range. therefore, you cannot activate it at a store. however, the phone is capable of physically communicating with the verizon network, so all you need is for a verizon tech to wave his magic wand and their system will accept it. but then again, when i activated account-level support for volte, my voice send/receive capability cut out completely and i had to contact vzw tech support. they were able to re-enable voice calling and attributed the initial problem to the fact that i'm not using a vzw device. who knows .   awesome device. the best android so far. i have an iphone 6 and a note 4. the iphone is great but has a lot of restrictions for someone not from the apple eco-system. note 4 has 53 preinstalled apps that cannot be removed. touch wiz eats more that 2 gb of ram all the time. wont be an issue for an avg. user. i needed more. so, the nexus 6 is awesome and i have 1.5 gb of ram free after having all my apps like 30 of the open. premium feel and built. a bit overpriced by amazon but smooth and fast delivery as always. ================================================================================================= update: 5/21/2015 almost 2 months with my nexus 6 - here is what i have still fast. good overall performance. android updates: haven't seen 5.1 even though nexus is supposed to get it as soon as it comes out. camera: slow to launch, operation is slow. even after you have clicked a photo, 2 mins later it is still processing the hdr mode photo. accelerator: fails every now and then. solution is to clear cache in boot mode once a week. battery: major drawback my usage profile: medium (no gaming, casual camera use, mostly mails, browsing net - 2 hrs a day) with my usage (medium to heavy) i normally get 10 to 11 hours on any phone i have used. this one dies in 5 hours. i have to charge it twice or thrice a day. contacted motorola support 3 times. - was directed to a moto site on "tips to save battery - turn off gps, wifi, btooth when not is use" - well moto - if i have to do that all day, why do i have a smartphone. i never did that on any of my phones. no resolution yet. have been asked to try an alternate charger. seems have to switch to samsung pretty soon. wasted 700k =================================================================================================== update: 06/06/2015 finally, what i wished for. changing back to '5 stars' my last update was '2 stars' for bad battery n loads of problems: had motorola replace it. the 2nd one which arrived was even worse. this time the problem was - random reboots every 15 to 20 mins. got my 3rd replacement from moto last week with 5.1.1 on it (the original from amazon had 5.0) this is perfect - holds charge for like 12 - 14 hours (i am a power user) - no reboots at all - fixed more minor issues: camera is faster even wireless charging is faster than before. couldn't be happier! i guess its 5.1.1. that helped .   beats the iphone 6 plus with ease(yep, i have both), but it should get better battery life and a 1080p screen would have been fine .   crazy monster i love it, screen is beautiful took it out of the box put my at card, registered the imei with at&t and that's it. its perfect. thank god i picked this one over the gs6 or the iphone 6. didn't fancy this blue color very much, but it is without any doubt the fastest and smoothest smartphove i've ever saw. be aware that the nexus 6 isn't meant for the gerenal public, buy it only if you already are a power user that's into modding or if you are willing to start with this life, otherwise i guess that other phones may suit you better. about the size, it is big, you'll need big hands to get used, but it sure doesn't feel as big as it looks. that's due to it's curved back, which makes it fits in your hand .   11/30/2015 update: it has been 6 months started with the chroma rom out of the box (literally). pretty amazing device, battery still going strong, able to squeeze 20 hours of continuous use of that uhd monster screen. this version the nexus 6 was on sale on black friday for $249.00, ordered one for my father in law and another one for my brother. if you still find the us version new, buy it, you will not regret it. since purchased, i went to the schlitterbahn near south padre, only utilizing a simple bumper case and a glass screen protector, documented my kids on the park's waterfalls and rivers. yes, it was wet. turned off, pulled out of the case and turned it back on, pretty amazing device to not be water proof certified! still going strong as of today. original comments: please be aware of what you are buying. there are at least 2 versions of this device per storage capacity (please bear with me here): xt1100 (international = gsm only) and xt1103 (us = gsm+cdma). both comes in 32gb and 64gb/blue or white varieties. amazon doesn't not specify whether you will get the international or the us version (some sellers are doing it now). as usual, cdma = sprint (may or may not accept this device in their network as yet)/verizon wireless (tricky to get a sim card) and gsm = t-mobile/at&t. this device uses nano sim card, same the iphone 5, 5c, and 5s uses (get it from your provider or buy a sim card cutter like theâ #1 nano sim card cutter, aerb mini /standard & micro to nano sim for iphone 6 plus iphone 6 iphone 5 iphone 4, 4s and other phones + metal tray + 2 sim adapters + sand paper, all in one pack). yes, it is qi wireless charging capable and qualcomm quick charge 2.0 certified. now, there are also the wireless network provider versions .   if this is the device need (want), put it in your shopping cart and see how price fluctuate .  fun times, enjoy your new, expensive nexus 6 .   phone works great. its a little bigger than i'm used to, but i got over that pretty quickly. you will need a nano sim card, which my verizon store would not give me. after a long talk with tech support, they eventually mailed me a sim. however, i also learned that you can cut down a micro sim to make it work in a nano slot, which is what i ended up doing. once i did this, the phone registered on the network and worked great .   this phone is a huge disappointment. while i do love the build of this phone, stock lollipop, storage size, and speakers, the screen and the camera on this phone is just terrible. viewing angles are terrible, changing colors and rainbowing out with little movement, and the camera is grainy and terrible even in good lighting. battery life is also not that great .   it's an average phone, one that i am not too happy with .   the phone is great it really met my expectations from all direction. here are some points of the phone after one month of usage: (i'll start with the bad stuff then go to the good things about the phone) ugly stuff: - if you choose to lock your phone with a pass code an someone called you the screen does not activate. you have to do it manually in able to be able to answer the call. - the phone is all screen. sometimes it feels like its gonna fall an crack bad stuff: - the phone is too huge to handle. if you don't like big phones this one is too big - in some online reviews and unboxing of the phone, it says that it comes with another charger that you can put the phone on it an it'll charge, but i am not really sure about that, mine didn't have that. - data usage is too high, you should really pay attention to the data usage. - high price. although i really think its worth it comparing to other devices. - you can't place the phone on a flat surface. it'll keep rotating due to the curve. good stuff: - battery life ( guaranteed full day) sometimes more repentant on usage. - screen is great for videos and other media. - high quality pics although i don't take pictures a lot. - the sound is a beast. - no lag at all, due to its processor .   works better then my old note 3, and doesn't have all of samsung/verizon bloatware that you can't turn off .   love this phone. the best phablet out there hands down .   great phone, product as described .   this version can't be activated on verizon. sad, but verizon only has the midnight blue version (for now). great phone .   really it's one of the best android phone that i have used i like it so much, and i'm very happy to buy it. it's not very big as they said, at least for me i fill it's very comfortable but sure you can't use it by one hand conveniently .   perfect. if you are thinking of getting it, get it. i am on verizon and it seems android 5.1 is rolling out later than other carriers but its not because of the phone. it is difficult to get a glass screen protector to fit because of the curved edges, but hey .   its the best phone i have ever owned and i am usually a galaxy owner. no thanks galaxy s6 i'll stick with this .   i picked this phone up to replace an iphone 5s - so, lots of changes. the nexus 6 is big, there's absolutely no way around that. it's larger even than the iphone 6 plus. and it felt pretty bulky initially. worse yet, the phone seems to want to be dropped. the shape seems to defy my ability to grip it. i don't know how many times i've fumbled the thing. but i got used to the size pretty quickly. and the addition of a case with a rubberized texture has made it much more grip-able. the screen is huge, crisp, vibrant. it's terrific. a massive upgrade from my iphone. i've been using a galaxy tab 7 as an e-reader fora while now, and that's no longer necessary. nook and kindle books are very legible on the nexus 6. i have absolutely no trouble reading email and web pages. video playback is terrific. the nexus 6 ships with a vanilla install of android 5.0/lollipop. no weird extensions or customization built-in. it's the closest you're going to get to pure android. and it works well. the interface is quick and responsive. the visual aesthetic is consistent. the whole thing seems a lot more intuitive than my samsung-ified tab 7. battery life is pretty good considering how big the screen is. i'll routinely end the day at around 50%; where my iphone was closer to 30% by the time i was putting it away for the day. i really haven't had to make any effort to save power. i'm not disabling location services or anything like that. i suspect that if i could easily get two days of use out of a single charge if i had to. the nexus 6 came with a "quick charge" adapter that's supposed to charge to nearly-full in an hour or so, but i'm not using it. the nexus 6 also has qi-compatible wireless charging built-in, so i picked up a tylt charger and i've been using that. it's terrific to just drop my phone on the cradle and charge it up without having to fumble with any plugs. audio is surprisingly good. i don't generally expect much from a phone in this regard .   but the nexus 6 has two front-facing speakers that actually deliver decent sound. i had absolutely no trouble watching several television programs on it. and my ringer is hard to ignore. i'm a little annoyed at the lack of user-serviceable parts. coming from an iphone, i was sort of looking forward to being able to swap-out my battery or throw in an sd card if i ran out of storage - but neither of those things are possible on a nexus 6. this doesn't bother me too much, since i've been on an iphone for years. but it might be a bit of a shock if you're coming from some other android devices. i had absolutely no trouble activating this device on my verizon account. i just pulled the sim card out of my iphone and plugged it into the nexus 6. a few minutes later i had a fully-functional phone. i'd recommend that you might want to go in and manually set your preferred network type .   seems like i've gotten a better signal since i manually set it to lte instead of the default global setting. it also seems like the nexus 6 has a better antenna than my iphone did - i'm able to connect to wireless networks from further away, and with better signal strength .   very beautiful phone, i love it .   my 3rd moto android phone and the best by far. i'll never go back to a smaller phone. i think of it as a pocket tablet. screen size is perfect for all the stuff i use it for. almost don't need a laptop anymore. android 5.1 is excellent. the phone did have the random reboot problem that was widely reported for nexus 6, but it never happened while actually using the phone. and now the problem is completely gone with the 5.1 android update (phone came with 5.0.1). but it did take almost two months for the 5.1 update (ota) to show up. i'm using verizon, but i got the phone before they were selling it. note: i actually wrote the above review on june 4th, 2015, not march 23rd as the website shows. one more thing i want to mention: the kindle app is great on this phone. this is the first android phone i've been able to comfortably use it on. the screen size is finally big enough .   by far the best phone out, just unlock the bootloader root it and then run a custom rom and youre good to go! as far as size goes you shouldnt lower the grade based on size. its a large phone .  you should have known that before buying. sadly, this phone would not activate on verizon wireless. i even went to a certified verizon wireless store, not a reseller. of course, verizon being the ego-maniacal company that they are, did not have my phone's imei number in their database nor would they add it. the rep tried using an active nano-sim card but that did not work either. i ended up having to get the nexus 6 directly from verizon. i even tried to use the sim card from my verizon-branded nexus 6 into this unlocked nexus 6 and it still would not recognize it. who knows, maybe there is something wrong with the phone. i hate having to use yet another cellular-branded phone but my hands were tied .   most excellent phone. iâ€™ve owned my nexus 6 for a week now so here are my initial impressions. first, if you will be using your nexus 6 in the usa, be sure your model is the xt1103. that is the version that google, motorola, amazon (directly), and all the wireless carriers sell. some of the amazon marketplace resellers are selling the international version which doesnâ€™t support some of the lte frequency bands used in the usa. (you would get slower data speeds on your expensive phone.) the nexus 6 is a huge phone and my first â€œphabletâ€. before owning it, i thought it would be too big, especially when coming from a puny 4.7â€ nexus 4. but i can say iâ€™ve adjusted nicely to it and have had no real issues holding or using it, even with one hand. i am very careful with it however, and i put it in a case right away. whatâ€™s good: - the size. its great reading articles and watching videos on this huge screen! - the picture. the display is rich with deep blacks and vibrant colors. when i look at my old phone, the color is very muted. - android lollipop 5.1 â€“ this is the very latest version of android and with the nexus 6 you will get it first. there are some very useful new features with this release, and 5.1 fixes lots of bugs that hampered the nexus 6 before. - fast. the phone is very fast and doing whatever you need it to do. - quick charger does charge the phone very fast. it may not be good for the long term life of the battery, but it sure is handy. at night, i use an old slow charger. whatâ€™s not as good: - the size. if you have small hands, forget about one handed use. also it may not fully fit in your pants pockets. - average battery life for me. but i have every feature turned on and use the phone throughout the day. ymmv - screen in direct sunlight. when walking outside or when mounted on my dash, when direct sunlight hits it, i canâ€™t see the screen very well, even at max brightness. - slow camera. it takes it a bit to load. and especially in low lighting, it takes a bit more for the camera to focus. - some minor lollipop bugs and annoyances persist. but that is to be expected when you are the first to get the latest version of android. you will also be the first to get the fixes. - expensive. the retail price for this thing is way too much. fortunately iâ€™ve seen amazon (proper) drop the price periodically, so if you havenâ€™t purchased it yet, you may see the price fluctuate to your advantage. features to try out: - ambient display â€“ whenever you get a text or notification, itâ€™ll briefly show it on the screen when your phone is locked. also if you gently move your phone, it will show the time and any notifications. very handy. - always on â€œok googleâ€ â€“ the phone will respond to your voice commands even while the screen is off and unplugged. - smart lock â€“ when at home, work, or connected to bluetooth devices, the screen will not lock. - add pc keyboard â€“ with this huge screen, why not include a dedicated row of numbers on your keyboard? - chrome text scaling to 120% - a bigger screen should show larger text, not more tiny text. - turn animation scale to .5x â€“ this is a developer option. changing window, transition, and animator duration scales to .5x will make your phone appear more zippy. in summary, i really like the larger screen and added features of the nexus 6 compared with my old nexus 4. if youâ€™re coming from a nexus 5 or any flagship phone from 2014, the upgrade may not be as beneficial however. keep an eye out for discounts and deals once the next big wave of 2015 phones gets in full swing. the nexus 6 will be a workhorse for a long while, and will always have latest version of android before any non nexus phone, so that helps keep it relevant too .   i figured everyone crying about the size of this thing was just wining. that their hands were small, and that being able to use one hand was a luxury i wouldn't miss .   i was wrong. no, i didn't really miss the ability to use my phone one handed, what i missed was being able to reach every corner of the screen with my thumb. using the phone with one hand isn't the problem, it's using it efficiently. to use the entire phone you have to re-position your hand if you have any hope of reaching the top left hand corner of the screen with your right thumb. and holding the phone is uncomfortable if you go about it as you're used to, you have to hold it like you've never held a phone before. i'm better off sticking with my nexus 5 and getting a tablet if i want something this big. the nexus 6 is just unnecessary and inconvenient. software also left much to be desired. i would click the "hangouts" application and the contacts application would be the one to open. once or twice would have been okay but it happened over half a dozen times in about the two hours i experimented with the device. my nexus 5 might have started to lose some battery life, but at least the phone itself still worked .   the battery is one of the best out currently (3/17/15). and the size is easy to get used to. has a beautiful screen, and camera and is unbelievably smooth. 10/10 would recommend .   i am having the same problem my nexus 6 back cover is peeling off under the power, volume buttons. that is really bad .   i returned it after a week because the battery wouldn't last a day at all. i barely use my phone for my nine hours of work, but by 10pm it would be less than 10%. i tried every single thing to stop the battery drain, but it happened regardless of settings. there is something wrong with the kernel, and i'm not flashing or rooting to fix an issue that shouldn't be there in the first place. other than battery life, the phone is fantastic .   the product is awesome. but the packaging and handling was awful. i am very sad because of that. the appearance was compromised. it has dents in the back .   ego-central 'chic' mentality of google turns a fine device into trash. if you have "old-folks" fingers - do not buy this. the keyboard is badly crafted - results in many spurious characters. if you try to use imap e-mail -- google deliberately makes it hard. and where is the e-mail address book .   google does not want us to know. terrible non-documentation. google tries to be so clever they ignore common function - software written by 'savants' - or should say 'idiot savants' - at once clever and stupid. the display is superb. audio is superb. keyboard & mail are wretched .   1st things 1st. this is an unlocked phone and i have it running on the verizon post paid network. i took it to a verizon store and they were unable to activate it without calling for help from a higher level tech. even then it took over an hour. if the store you go to is very busy, they very well might blow you off and say it can't be done. i'm here to tell you it can! make sure that they check the network settings on the phone and switch it over to lte 1st and don't have the wifi on. it'll mask the lte activation. i had an existing account and they activated a new sim. so ignore the reviews that say it can't be done. very cool phone! nice to have clean, pure android with the updates 1st. i have big hands so the phone is easy to use. the screen is bright and easy to read. coming from a note 4 its a very easy transition. i'm a little put off by the fact that they decided to not include a sd card slot. with such a premium phone why not? the battery life is pretty good. i've been on it a lot and it does well. i'll be kicking the tires good for the next week and i'll let you know how it feels once lollipop 5.1 hits it .   someone had to say it, this is the american version. xt1103. i have it on metropcs right now, lte is displayed up top. apn settings in phone are compatible with metropcs. built for people who got big hands like me, ppi is incredible, quality is perfect, speakers facing forward  .  finally .   everything about it great. go here: http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/videos/ and download the root tool, you'll need to back up files, uninstall all current drivers on computer, install their drivers, unlock bootloader and then root it, and you'll access all the phone without bricking it. starting up and shutting down the phone is much much faster. if you do brick your phone, the software itself will allow you to flash rom with stock rom and go back to the way it was right out the box. the led light notifications are behind the top speaker, red blue and green lights, you must root phone and download "light flow". you don't need to buy it, google it and download the apk file. you can get rid of the annoying search bar on home screen. you can disable all annoying bloatware and google apps you don't need and never use. this phone becomes your phone once you do all this. i made the mistake of loosening my grip with the galaxy mega 6.3 and dropped it while i was sitting down, i cracked the screen in the corner, so i am being extra careful this time with a better case and always holding my nexus 6 phone tight. highly recommend this phone to anyone with big hands and big demands for quality .   i tried two units. both had the same spots on the back. i think there is a problem with the shipping of these phone. there is no protective plastic on the back for shipping and it seems that the back is rubbing on the box during shipping causing the spots. for 649.00 i think it needs to come to the consumer defect free .   received defective .   so far so good, it is a bit large, used to the nexus 5, i do miss the smaller size at times, but i'm sure i will get used to it .   bad phone for the price. it supposed to have stock android, but this resulted in significant limitations to the phone's capabilities. examples: - you can not stream videos from your phone to your tv. -the led light is disabled and you can not enable it unless you root your phone. -camera functions are limited: ex: you can not touch to focus .   ets. and the worst part: it has the worst screen i have ever seen, it has bad yellow (wb) and warm bad colors. i did not get a lemon. if you put it side by side with other high end phones like note 4, the screen looks disgusting .   had the previous 2 generations of nexus devices, by far this is the best one i have ever owned, if you love the pure android experience, timely software updates, and an amazing screen, this is the phone you want to have .   great phone. after using several days it is hard to use anything smaller. the screen is clean and sharp with great colors. wireless charging is one of the best features on this phone along with stock android. phone calls are clean and crisp with no problems hearing or being heard. the dual speakers are loud but not obnoxious, maybe need a little more bass, but what do you expect from a phone .   i love it *.*. love the phone the only thing i dislike is the screen color calibration it really goes to the warm side tho it isn't that bad but still a just a tiny bit more white would be good the phone is fast, smooth, is light not heavy as my previous htc one max. speakers sound very well close enough to the htc. they're loud and clear. battery isn't that surprising as other said but hopefully with the arrival of lollipop 5.1 it will be fix to match other phones with the same amount of charge. so, if you are thinking of buying this phone to use on verizon's towers, think again. i bought this and a nano-sim cutter. after all of my excitment, it turns out that once you put the sim card in, because this is sold by motorola, not google play, the imei is not recognized by verizon, and it will only get 3g signal. it came up lte but said all circuits are busy when i tried to dial. then i had the brilliant idea of dialing *228, which permanently tied me to 3g only on it. went to the vz store and, of course, they told me they couldn't help me because it wasn't a verizon-sold phone. i bought this phone because i wanted to be able to unlock the bootloader and root without having to rely on verizon. ** edit: i can only attest to the motorola-bought (amazon) phone. not the one from google play store. i haven't tested that one yet, but i did read that you wouldn't have issues with that one. http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/11/22/psa-cdma-carriers-probably-wont-activate-your-nexus-6-unless-it-was-purchased-from-google-play-or-that-carrier-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/ check out the chart in that link .   fit my expectations. just as described. perfect condition. works flawlessly! shipped and delivered extremely fast. thanks!  .   one of the most solid phones out there. i still have it now and i don't think i'll be replacing it anytime soon .   it's like new as described and well packaged with original packing materials. it has been working well so far and i really like everything with this phone .   very, very disappointed! i got this phone for work! first, it started lagging, then it started restarting while not in use or when i am engaged in an activity on my phone. now as of 11/6/2016, the charging port is damaged! i have no insurance as if it would have done me any good as i would have had to pay between $200-$250 for a refurbished phone when i only paid $59 and some change for a new one .   i have so much important stuff on my phone i need for work and priceless videos of my kids, family, and loved ones who have passed a away. this is a total lost, my livelihood is on the dead block .   my wife is very happy with her new phone .   the nexus 6 is a great phone! however tread carefully with a so called "refurbished" phone purchase. i received the nexus 6 in less than fair condition and cannot get it replaced. i should have known better than to buy a used phone from amazon. they said they would replace it after i buy another one then send the old one back which is something i cannot do. now i am stuck with a buggy phone that has several issues. as far as the nexus 6 goes, it is a wonderful smartphone running android 7.0 nougat. perfect screen to shell ratio, sturdy, nice camera, and smooth app transitioning .   very pleased .  works great .   product arrived in perfect condition with no visible damage etc. came with original cords and packaging. very satisfied with my purchase .   excellent phone for the money. i had a note 7 that was returned under recall and i needed a phone to hold me over until something comes out that i like and is comparable. the lgv20 and google pixel xl do not support wireless charging which is a dealbreaker for me. the s7 edge is a step down in size and the radical curve on that screen detracts from reading books etc. this phone has a beautiful screen (little dim in direct sunlight compared to samsung but definitely good for 95% of my daily usage), excellent speakers, will be updated to nougat, and plenty fast for anything that i have thrown at it. i actually don't miss my samsung s6 that i traded in for the note 7 .   very pleased with this product .   because it's a nexus. great phone. google always makes a good product. definitely get this if you have larger hands, my hands are probably a little bigger than average and it seems to fit into them perfectly - i can still used swiftkey keyboard with 1 hand so the screen isn't too large .   ok. excellent phone all around . the condition was amazing . great seller. no issues .   probably the best phone i've ever owned. lovely huge screen. the interface is quite response. the camera takes clearer better pictures than any phone i've had before. everything i've used on it works better than any phone i've ever had except that the google play app store seems to be confused about what phone i own. rather, it thinks i don't have a phone, even though i've logged in to the app store via the new phone. so i just can't use the web interface to the app store to select apps for the new phone .   i'm an artist, not a tech guy. that said, i like the phone. the transitions from one app to another are smooth, and the over-all phone experience is pleasant. the camera is great, and the editing functions are adequate .   this is the phone i have always wanted. big, powerful, and immediately rootable so i can have it my way .   i've only had this phone three days, but the first thing i've noticed is that i get good signal strength in places where with any of my other previous phones i've gotten poor or no signal at all. from a functional point of view this phone is a magnification work of art, after all what is more important than actually being able to use a phone no matter where you are at. the quality of its signal strength is very noticeable. this phone was very easy to root. i rooted it so i can use the ant+ feature. with the right utility, this phone is essentially brick proof. addendum 9/19/2016 i have been able to use my phone with a ant+ heart rate monitor, i also plan on purchasing a cadence sensor. i am still very happy with this phone, i flashed a beta version of nougat on it. i am especially happy with its sensitivity of signal strength .   i can't imagine how i got by with a screen size less than 6 inches .   really great phone love the nexus 6 had a sony z4 before this but this is a really great phone. the best phone for its $300 i got on amazon .   fantastic phone. at the price it's a steal. working great. just like new .   quality used phones. mine was in very good to excellent condition. had it up and running in no time flat. i converted from iphone to android and was having messaging issues. my text not sending. turns out i havd imessage on and facetime. so be sure to turn those off before you remove your sim from iphone .   my phone came on time and is a very nice product, i'm very excited to have it .   had the phone 1 month and charger port died .   i do love the phone but im in the caribbean and it seems like it's locked to at&t is there anyway for u to unlock this for me please. its huge its easy to use. its better than my htc m8 with android 6. m8 was ruined with a lousy make of android 6 was very poorly developed .   i loved the m8 too. only downside to the nexus is no card slot for it. other than that. great phone. its huge it has stereo speakers. it is easy to type on. and runs android 6 perfectly. that's all i want. it to run good! m8 didn't do that after android 6. want a huge phone that works good and isn't 600 bucks and runs android 6. the nexus 6 is for you .   shipping was on point .   thank you. this is the best phone ever. i love the size and i love stock android .   got it to replace my wife's broken phablet. she has yet to start complaining about it, so it's a win for me .   awesome phone .   i really like my new nexus, though it was kind of sad losing some features that the moto x 2014 offered that the nexus doesn't (gestures, etc) .   love this phone. it takes little in the way of getting used to when switching from an iphone to this phone. not because they aren't very different - they are - but because it is supremely user-friendly. in fact i'd say that for a beginner to a smart phone that this would be the better option to go with purely due to the fact that it is so intuitive in terms of learning to use it. it helps greatly if you are already familiar with and use google - have gmail, etc. you do need to use google music. pretty much everything on there is google related but i was able to with zero problem download my favorite apps - like waze, fb,paypal, etc for instance with zero problem and much faster than iphone as well in fact i'd say computer power is faster altogether. it seems that it updates automatically as well. also except for music (i'm not sure if there is a free option or not) which i pay $9.99/,month, which is the industry standard price, i haven't yet had need to purchase anything else. i'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it highly .   since this phone is not being sold anymore .   i hate it that takes away one star .   i had a moto g 2 gen .   which is a great phone as well .   but the huge screen i love an it's fast with speed .   the front speakers isn't too loud when u are talking on speaker phone but over all i believe i got my monies worth. my son loves his new phone. the thing is huge and the display is fabulous. the phone ships without a sim card but i took it to verizon and they fixed me up. they said i got a "hell of a deal". the device works! however, like any android phones update the os your self. i recommend nexus devices. stock android is the way to go .   phone has worked great. battery doesn't last as long anymore but that's to be expected. wear and tear .   purchased this for a family member. she was concerned about it being larger before getting it, but is delighted with it now. the screen is beautiful, the performance is snappy, has a nice camera, and having a nexus is great in order to get timely system updates. i decided this was the way to go when my other family member's older nexus 7 tablet was still getting android updates (to marshmallow) after years of use and still going strong. this is the type of support i expect to get, not the kind you get from the carriers where they stop providing builds usually some time after the first year to push you into purchasing another device to stay supported. highly recommend .   good phone, vanilla android, huge uhd screen, front facing speakers>>>omg you dont know you need this until you have it. overall a good buy for those who are a little more tech savvy and can navigate around un-skinned aosp .   awsome, the speakers are loud, screen is awsome, the processor clock speed is crazy; 2.7 ghz .   got a great deal on this phone. i got it expecting some signs of wear since it was used, but it is like new. also came in a day earlier than the expected earliest delivery date. the phone itself is amazing. no bloatware, super fast and its huge. screen quality is amazing. very happy .   pros: beautiful screen (1440p i think), dual front facing speakers, decent camera (not the best), google now launcher already installed, having google with just one swipe, fast (for the first 6 months then preforms average), and etcetera (i can't thing more thing off the top of my head). cons:after having this for a while it got slow and i'm not downloading random stuff (my android phones get slow of about one year of usage). also the screen burn-in is horrific in my opinion. i've used one app to help the screen burn-in (amoled burin-in fixer) and it did help it a lot but couldn't get rid of the "ghost image" on the screen (the burn-ins were on the notification bar and navigation bar). the battery life on the nexus 6 is not that good. it will last me about 4-3 hours depending on my usage. when my device first arrived i saw a chip on the camera but luckily you could not notice it on the camera app. sometimes when i'm in class my phone randomly restarts during the middle of class and makes that really annoying at&t boot sound and eventually my teacher takes up my phone which gets me really mad (it has happened about 18-20 times to me). i would recommend a different smart phone if you are keeping it for more than 1 year, like the iphone or a samsung note device .   i previously had a nexus 5, this phone is similar in many ways, except of course it is larger. i like the large screen, now the nexus 5 seems tiny. the screen clarity is very impressive. i am only giving it 4 stars due to some minor issues which may or not be the fault of the phone - could be problems with my own wi-fi connection .   phone is exactly what i had hoped for. large screen, fast and lots of development on xda. very satisfied with the shipping speed from the seller .   too big. wonderful interface. google trumps iphone .   4 months in and i'm still enjoying it. i'll probably be selling it and getting a g4, since the only thing wrong with this phone is the non removable back, battery, and storage. also, when i turn my volume to max on speaker or sometimes playing music, the top speaker can click .   i like it with one drawback, no operators manual. wheres the manual  .   yes, it's big, but it's not too big. i really like this phone. signed up for google fi with this phone and it works fine. verizon works better, but google fi costs 1/2 as much .   wow, the power. just slightly buggy, but easily one of the best pieces of hardware on the market for the price. trust me, buy the unlocked version, vanilla android lollipop is an outstanding os. battery life is superior. turbocharging is incredible, wireless charging is ridiculously convenient. can't believe this phone isn't more popular .   fantastic phone. big, but that's not a drawback if you happen to be wanting a lot of screen. i just use a belt pouch or clip to reduce pocket bulk. the phone itself is very fast and responsive. camera is sharp, and it takes good video. google one drive and other network cloud storage cushions the blow from not having an sd card slot. that's my only gripe. other than that it's all good. 5/5. great phone, but if you're purchasing this for your at&t account because you're eligible for an upgrade, at&t will hit you with a monthly service charge of between $15 (10gb data plan) or $25 (15gb plan), or even more for larger data plans. the only way you can get them to rescind the additional monthly fee is to follow the instructions on the att.com/planchange page - sent after activation in a friendly text. at&t is working very hard to force customers onto the next upgrade scheme rather than subsidizing the cost of a new device. this deal adds $300/year to my bill that i did not expect when i bought the phone. caveat emptor .   i have had this phone about three months now and i am disappointed. apps constantly crash and the phone sometimes just turns off when i'm in a call. it's a shame because i like the size of the phones screen. i've had notes in the past but thought i'd give motorola a chance since price was better. i really wish i had bought the note 4 or even the mega from samsung. up date 7/6/15, when i originally wrote this review i was running lollipop 5.0 i have upgraded to 5.1.1 and that has fixed alot of the issues i was having with the apps crashing. the battery runs down a little faster now but charges back up fast with the included turbo charger. also the phone no longer turns off in the middle of a call the way it used to. i raise my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. the upgrade saved me from having to trade this phone for something else .   it is an amazing phone, really fluid and beautiful os. i do not know how i used to have a small phone (galaxy s3), big screens are awesome! and specially this one. i was reading everywhere that this phone was too big. i was afraid it was indeed going to be too big for my hands, as i dont think i have big hands. but it is perfect. it does feel big in my pocket though. but i would recommend it to everyone .   don't be afraid of picking this phone if what you are looking for is the international version of the motorola nexus 6. the model i received is the xt1100 and as such it covers the following bands: lte band 1(2100), 3(1800), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 9(1800), 19(800), 20(800), 28(700), 41(2500). the product features and technical details of this phone in this webpage are incorrect. i've been using my phone for one month already and have found nothing wrong with it, aside from the fact that i live in america and the turbo charger that came in my box is only compatible with european power outlets. coming from a nexus 4, the battery life has been spectacular and it can last me the whole day easily. one word of advice, contact your seller just to confirm that what they are selling is indeed the xt1100 version just to be sure .   this is your first nexus phone and i now know what one been missing out on. i can't believe i waited this long. so happy with this phone and the money saved by getting via amazon was even better .   amazing .   nice phone. awesome phone, a few quirks but overall a 5/5 in my book .   despite its full price the phone was delivered locked. had difficulties in unlocking the phone. i ended up by obtaining the unlock code from at&t services  .   after more than 30 min of discussion with their hotline support. the phone has a nice screen  .   but unconfortable layout for volume and power bottoms. the screen is large, nice for video viewing and even for work when out of the office. the large screen is yet not confortobale for those who operate the phone in one hand (difficult to swap the fingers accross the screen). difficult to find a classical ring tone .   those availabe are all not common ones  .   after few weeks of use  .   i am still not realizing that the phone is ringing  .   the available ringtones need to be upgraded .   nice phone. i gotten a great price on it-lets say less than $120. brand new on contract so it works for me. thanks .   way above my expectations. this phone boasts a 4k resolution screen. i've owned most of the flagship models of random carriers and manufacturers over the years, because even though at first i was reluctant to join the smartphone revolution, i got sucked in and realized how cool it could be to own a personal computer in the palm of your hand. this nexus 6 is the best phone i've ever owned. it is super fast, the screen is crystal clear and goes way above what my 1080p 60 inch flat screen at home can even show. i love the fact that you can customize nexus phones, & i have my phone rooted running cyogenomod 12. if i have any recommendation for you if you are going to do that road, download ciandelta from the android marketplace. it automatically updates to the newest file .   the nightly build without having to download the entire file. it only downloads the small portion that had changed, which is between 20 and 30 megabytes. an effortless download and installation as long as you have a nice custom recovery installed such as tean win. the phone camera is great! it takes awesome pictures, both front and back cameras. the shutter speed is significantly improved with just a little bit tweaking of the settings. overall this is a great phone and a great buy. i have had this phone now for about 2 months, and waited until i knew for sure it was good before i wrote this review. you will not be disappointed. - alex. the nexus 6 is a flawless phone. there is nothing bad about it. i only wish i had a white one. that's it .   i had my doubts about buying this device since i live in the middle east ( saudi arabia ). my doubts came as i was worried that the device might not work in my country but it actually did ! i had a nexus 5 before this phone which encouraged me to buying this one since my experience with it was more than excellent. i am really looking forward to testing this new device and will -possibly- update this review later with pros and -i hope there isn't any- cons. i would like to thank you ( both google and the seller ) for the brilliant phone and would like to assure anyone who has doubts about this phone being locked, that if it worked perfectly in my country, i am 100% sure it will work in yours ;) thank you again and god bless you all  .   excellent. a bit big though. best phone i have ever owned .   nice mobile. awesome phone .   i haven't gone back to my iphone 6 yet .   this is a keeper .   after a couple months with this phone, there's very few things i don't like about it. despite being the largest phone i've ever used, it's easy to get used to. it's fast, beautifully made, and has great specs (including inductive charging, which is kinda cool.) being a larger phone, though, it's difficult to hold/use in one hand at any sort of an angle since (even with my larger hands) you can't easily reach the top of the screen with your thumb if you're bracing the bottom edge with your pinky. overall, would definitely recommend if you're into larger phones. fast, smooth, responsive. the battery life is far better than my last phone(atrix hd). it felt a little large and unwieldy at first but after getting used to it i find it more comfortable than a small screen .   simply awesome .   not a 5, due to getting ph# saved, and port readjusted to receive and send calls-texts. big device, but fits in most pockets .   i received my nexus 6 today and i have to say that 1: there was dust on the phone i literally had to clean it. 2: there is light blemishes on the back of the phone 3: the charger wire is not sealed in any plastic is that how motorolla ship their product to the customers .   very good. the phone is great did not think i would like the transition to a bigger phone but i love it great buy .   i'm not going to lie, it's big! the length wise doesn't bother me as much as the width, but i have no issues keeping it my pocket. however when holding it i feel like i'm going to drop it. i will be ordering a case to hopefully resolve this. this is the very first android phone i've ever owned coming from 4 generation of iphones. i bought the nexus due to it not being bloated with manufacture software, and could get lollipop instantly. it's a great phone to transition from apple too. the screen looks gorgeous, the specs almost triple the iphone 6+, and the build quality is up to par with apples. i would recommend it if you don't mind the larger scale 6" phone, otherwise try out the motox which is considerably smaller .   my 2013 moto x took a spill due to my affinity for being clumsy so i was in need of a new handset. my requirements for the device werebetter battery life (not necessarily the best, but better than what i have now), a serviceable camera, good build quality and a 'stock' version of googles android operating system. to those who don't otherwise know, stock android refers to android without customizations from a 3rd party oem like samsung or htc. back in the day, when android was 'ugly' and sparse, these software overlays made a lot of sense .  so much in fact that google began adopting features present in those overlays into the base level of the operating system. with the release of kit kat, (version 4.4) i kinda could still get why someone would opt for htc's or samsungs interface, if only for flair, even though i preferred the cleaner look of googles version. however, this device ships with 5.0 lollipop, which is a massive update and affects everything you see and touch .  and its the first time the o.s. doesnt feel 'bare bones'. its every bit as 'pretty' and elegant as ios is (id argue the aesthetic is prettier, with more pleasing animations, but thats just my preference) and its worlds better than many of the software overlays you'll see on phones at att. (paticularly samsung, with its unrefined looking icons and constant bleeps and bloops which are maddening.) there is a cohesiveness to the design that is only really matched by ios and no previous version of android comes close. the benefit of this is that you get increased performance and updates for your device get approved more quickly, because there is no 3rd party, outside of att, that has to ensure the update is implemented properly with existing software. if you are looking for the 'iphone approach' which is hardware made for the software, but on on android .  this is it. (the only downside for some folks is that this is more like the 'iphone 6plus' experience .  you'll have to look to the new moto x if you want something comparable to this same hardware/software accord on a smaller handset that competes with the iphone6) i strongly considered the moto x before getting this device .  however att refuses to let me customize it on the next program so that ruled it out. also, i wanted a significant bump in battery life, as opposed to only slightly better. the hardware is equally nice on the moto x. as long as you can stomach the size, you'll love this phone. its fast, fluid, extraordinarily well built and feels very premium. googles engineers were asked why they went with a device this big considering the nexus 5 was much smaller and they gave an answer that made me, a strictly one handed-use guy' a covert to big phones. 'whats the ideal size for a pocket internet device?' so spot on. there is only one tablet in our household and it sees most of its use by my s.o., so as someone who lacked a tablet, this is a great in between device. if you already have a tablet, the advantages of a giant phone may not be readily apparent, and it may actually seem silly. but as someone who doesnt have a tablet, it makes all the sense in the world. a few key points to consider, especially when looking at the other two big 'big' phones on the market. 1. screen: the resolution is great. text is fantastic. you get darker blacks then you do with the iphone6+ and less blown out colors than the note4. however, the note4's colors can be set to look more accurate, but most folks who i've seen with that device leave that paticular mode unchecked. there is an ever so slight difference in sharpness compared to the iphone6 plus (to the nexus' benefit). its a great screen, and a wonderful way to view all of your content. reading books in amazon or google play is a treat, and i've actually started to read more often given that its with me all the time. 2. camera: its damning praise to say it has the best camera ever on a nexus, but thats the case here. the camera is better than what was on my moto x and the colors are very very accurate. low light photography is a tad slow to focus, but the outcome is pleasing. i would still put it a tick or two below the note and 6 plus' camera, but the usability is much nicer and straightforward. my mom would have an easier time snapping a photo here and editing it then she would on her galaxy s4. you can shoot in 4k video, which is cool, but comes at a heavy space premium. low light photos between this and my buddies 6+ were very similar. its the first android camera that i've used that doesnt feel like i'm a second class citizen to what an iphone can produce. very big thumbs up. 3. build: perfect. motorola knows hardware. this is basically a mix between the old (2013) and 'new (2014) moto x design-wise. its a very wide phone however, noticeably wider than both the note and 6+. feels great in hand, weighty in a quality way. i prefer the texture to the note4's backplate, though it still doesnt feel as premium as the 6+ or something like the htc one. (build quality and materials quality are two different things however, and the nexus6 does excellent in the former and great in the latter.) 4. speakers: the quality of sound isnt as 'full' as the htc one, but man .  these speakers are incredibly good and i'd argue that they are louder. it has 2 of them, both front facing, which makes a huge difference when sharing a video or just enjoying content, which is something that you'll do often. they protrude ever so slightly from the front of the device, which keeps the screen safe if you ever leave it face down. 5. turbocharger and battery life: turbocharger works. maybe not 100% on the dot with googles claims, but man, this device charges quickly. in about a half hour of charging, being at 10% battery life, i was up to 34%. thats great considering the size of the battery. this morning, i pluged my phone in at 7:05, it was down to 9%, and by the time i left for work i had gotten up to a 94% charge. that is serioulsy impressive. as far as battery life itself goes, i've been pretty hard on my device the last few days i've had it. i've gotten an average of 3/12-4 1/2 hours of screen on time, which is with more than just 'average' usage .  this included a lot of gaming, chromecasting an enteire movie and running several benchmarks and having an android wear device (bluetooth) connect the whole time. lots of streaming music and video watching and website browsing as well. if your a moderate user, expect to get over 3 hours daily. my original moto x (with my specific usage) had just about had it by around 8-9pm .  so going out required a 'safety' charge. you wont have to worry about it with this device. 6. gaming: just crushes everything i throw at is. it has top of the line specs and because of that standard, instead of just running well for while its 'new' it will continue to do so for quite some time. despite the resolution, games load quickly and dropped frames is a non-issue all in all, i'm very happy with my purchase. this is one of the first bleeding edge devices i've owned so soon after its introduction and i plan on keeping it for quite some time. it does everything well and knowing i will still continue to get updates long after other oem's are simply worried about selling you their newest handset feels great. fwiw .  i still miss my moto x. there are some features there that not even stock android can replicate and if you want a smaller handset, i strongly encourage you to check out that device. had i had the ability to customize it, i would have more than likely gone that route. and if that or the nexus6 were not available, id still take even a last gen moto x, just for the features and feel in hand, over most other flagships .   daughter loves it. perfect. nice  .   phone works well. keep quality and realabilityiam satiesfied with the performance. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. for my daughter i'm not a iphone fan works as expected. excelent. this is my first apple iphone (was using android phones exclusively), the iphone se has been engineered very well. the ios (10.11) is easy to learn and use. all aspects of the se work flawlessly. if you like to tinker with phones apps to get them to work, get an android, if you want phone apps that work all the time, get an apple,. its all as described. it works well and using it now .   there were some scratches on the back but it's not noticeable unless you are looking for them, it works amazing it's very fast and i'm quite satisfied. some people like bigger phones before buying it i read reviews and such and a lot of people were saying it was very small but it really is a normal size it's just that the iphone 6 and up are large. so if you prefer larger phones i'd suggest the iphone 6, this phone otherwise is very similar performance rise with the iphone 6s it just does not have 3d touch which i don't care for, it's also around $200 cheaper than a iphone 6s. so just some things to think about (: i love the design of it also it seems very elegant and i'm overall very happy with my se. excellent, the best iphone, good price, 12 mp front camera, very fast processor, touch id fast. a product recommended for people who like phones with a maneuverable screen and that can be carried in the pocket of the pants. it's an iphone 6s with a 4 inch screen .   awesome phone with much more than expected performance. with the hardware of iphone 6s this little beautiful piece works so well. easy activation has sim card works great. cheap .  made in china stuff .   my order is unlocked version but this iphone se is locked version and i can't use it safely in china. what's more,there is no earphone inside .   great seller thank u the iphone was as described  .   good looking product. fast transport. it arrived on time and has worked great. easily set up phone service with at&t .   i always had android and decided to try the apple phone because of the size and others who have one say it's easy to use. i found it's about the same to use as android only a few things are nicer. for example, using bluetooth and answering the phone while it's on is a little faster to switch over and pairing is a little easier. using apple id i found to be a pain which isn't something android has. i hate all the sign in stuff that is needed to do things with pictures and email etc. i like the size of the phone and that was the main reason i tried it. overall i like but can't justify the cost other than apple charges for their name .   i love it. very reliable and fits in my hand perfectly. easy to use .   bought it for my partner who want new model but still small phone. great model. fast and easy to operate,. good. good. so disappointed. it doesn't work on verizon network so i'm having to return it .   very good mobile and all functions work very well. i recived an iphone 5s i bought and pay for and iphone se i demand a refund for the difference. sweet smart phone. my daughter loved her new phone .   fantastic. iphone se. it's an apple, for my daughter, she seems to like it .   no problems out of it ! i love my iphone se rose gold! the size is perfect for me. arrived non-functional. wouldn't turn on. returned it right away .   does not work on verizon network as stated in product description. would not activate and continues to say no service. sending back .   excellent phone, nice design, small, very comfortable to carry on your pocket. the camera is excellent at day and night, the front camera also take very good pics. in terms of speed, is very fast, i love this phone .   super super perfect! super super new. pretty good. i received a blu phone .   came in original packaging. as new as could be. shipment didn't take long and handling was good .   this was a gift, and my daugter is very happy with it .   tops. jet phone wow. amazing .   nice product  .   i do like this phone, was expecting it to process faster .  seems a bit faster than my iphone 5, but not a huge difference. love it. i had 5s that was cracked. so i had to replace the phone. it is just perfect. looks new .   best of the 6 in the smaller body .   all was perfect .   thanks .   just as advertised. no issues experienced at all .   exactly what i wanted, fast shipping .   i was a little skeptical about buying electronics online especially a phone, i hesitated whether or no i should buy it but i'm glad i did it was in perfect condition and the exact same model as described very happy with my purchase .   phone was not what i ordered, very disappointed. will not order again .   the sexy body of a 5s and the guts of a 6 .  yes. just yes. works wonderfully, my life has not been more organized. much easier, less painful to use than android .   love it .   i gave 1 star only for the iphone 5se because when i receive the phone, i found out that the pin key to open the sim card slot was missing and when i opened the sim card slot there was a verizon sim. i think that the phone was not brand new .   good product at great price and no contract worries .   great performance and a pocket size. i love it. you will .   great service and awesome phone .   very good. product ok. all my expectations. pretty good. device started heating, take it to mac store and been told that equipment is refurnished with no original parts as battery no new , therefore looks like the screen is loose bcouse not original baterry. the phone was in perfect condition .   great performance .   thnks. perfect item .   the mobile phone is faster than the 5s, is a small version of the iph6s. got this for a decent price (around $450 when i purchased) and bit the bullet. my other phone, an iphone 6s, was broken beyond repair so i removed my sim card from my iphone 6s and inserted it into the iphone se, plugged it into my itunes, and viola! a beautiful, operating phone .   when i opened the brown shipping box, i was surprised they didn't pad the inside more, but everything was in great shape. the white iphone box was still sealed, but the phone's protective film had some scratching on it, so i'm not sure what that was about. not an issue at all, since i was removing that anyway. the only thing that would've made the experience better would be faster shipping, but beggars can't be choosers .   great product. it was ok. very good phone. excellent. this phone is not compatible with verizon as they will not activate it. i tried to activate it and they told me it was not a verizon phone and would not activate it. they asked for the ime number to check against their database .   great product. perfect. the phone itself did not work as it should've on verizon, but the person i bought it from took care of everything. even though it didn't work, it was still a good experience .   every thing is ok. in my case: natural evolution, from a 4s to the se. the phone fullfiled my expectations .   the phone is great! the perfect combination of size and power, and includes a great camera .   do not buy from this seller- they are overpriced, and while i did purchase the product from another vendor in the end, and i can attest that it is an amazing device, quite possibly one of apple's very best, paying more money than one would pay at a mobile store or at an apple store is stupid, and so i am giving this a one-star review .   it attended my expectation on processor speed, oppening apps pretty quick. the battery, for my daily usage, lasts a little bit more than a day, what is expected from a smartphone .   i love my iphone, is the better .   works great. this is my first time owning an iphone & i must say that i'm thoroughly impressed so far. i am in jamaica so i ordered it unlocked but was a bit skeptical as to whether it could really work in my country. it did! i'm so happy .   the packaging was beautiful! it's my second time buying a phone on amazon & i've never been disappointed. i'm switching from a samsung s4 mini which i bought on amazon few years ago & i must say that was a great phone too. it fell so many times but still worked beautifully. i'm hoping that this new phone can withstand the falls just as well .  i've digressed but that's my tidbit .   great upgrade if you have a very old iphone. cheaper directly from apple, so only buy here if you have some gift card or points to use. if you have an iphone 5s, it's likely not worth the upgrade .   excelent .   nearly all the features of the iphone 6s in a 5s-sized package. fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate, camera is amazing, a9 chip is lightning fast. oh, and it still has a headphone jack. why buy a 6s when you can have this for $200+ cheaper .   good .   phone was used for a few days (not brand new as said in the ad listing) but packing was good and was in box along with new charger and new ear phones. overall happy with the service .   it's an iphone .   what else .   yes. it works excellent in uruguay .   the last steve jobs design. i love this format. it's still a phone. i don't want a tablet on my ear. coming from a 5s, don't see much diffrence .   as expected .   lovin' it .   my iphone has a little issue: when i press the home button it launch siri without my will, even i press very quick .   i love the phone had to wait on it because of the storm going on down south. but other then that great phone and fast shipping .   very good a+++. very great performance in operation system from apple, the touch screen & camera are look great, also there is the id touch sensor which unlock the phone when you press the home button everything is perfect i guess but if you like big screen this is not your phone it is not small but also not big with 4 inch screen. excelent .   i absolutely wanted the iphone se and now i can finally have one .   yes. i love that. awesome .   nice, small iphone with lots of power and great camera .   bad quality product. i bought a new iphone, but i received the box open. the amazon service told me that if the phone works, all is ok. in conclusiã³n, bad purchase and bad service. excelente. it did. spectacular phone. i purchased this phone and use it on straight talk network. this phone is amazing. i feel like i'm using the iphone 6s. it is much smaller though so be careful when typing. there's not much this phone cannot do. i highly recommend if you're looking for the iphone 6s but want it to fit in your pocket. :). everything was ok .   very good. perfect phone, like brand new no complains .   love it .   very pleased generally. getting used to it. have not tried out everything yet. did not realize how much stuff uses data instead of wi-fi. find that annoying. pleased to see how much can be done with the camera .   i was very excite when this arrived due to all the great review. right of the bat, the phone said i am on a lower ios update so it won't be able to transfer my content from my old iphone to this. but i ignored it. i had to individually redownload all my apps. netflix won't work. it won't let me update my ios. has chinese lettering in the back, like wtf. so many problems with this. i wish i could return this or get a replacement because this is bull-crap. very good phone. no problems .   excelent. good phone. came as indicated in retail packaging .   excelent product and seller. all went good. excellent, it couldn't be better. i love my new phone. quick delivery, decent price. no problems so far .   i am thrilled i purchased this iphone from this seller. the phone package itself, is wrapped in plastic wrap just the same as if it were purchased from the dealer. included is the ear buds and charger. i had it checked to be sure it was unlocked,and i am happy to report that it is. i love everything about the phone itself. works great even when multi-tasking,which is all i do all day. i have already downloaded many apps to use and nothing is slowing it down. this was a great purchase .   if you are in the market for a phone,and especially an iphone,this is the one to purchase. i highly recommend it to everyone. very easy to use and it is in perfect condition. exactly as described by the seller. i am extremely satisfied. https://www.amazon.com/dp/b01dajs4le/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28. good. this is an apple iphone but 100% chinese version that ha language, browser, apps and store settings in chinese language almost impossible to change. also, the earphone jack is too small so i can't fit the original iphone earphones or any other earphones in the audio jack. has a messed up screen and cant afford to send it back and not have a phone .   the phone is excellent, it work right out of the box with any provider .   well this was a gift to my dad and he loves it. he has it for a couple of months now and i just asked him how is the phone and he said it's perfect .   i'm very satisfied with my phone and the company. my phone shipped right away and arrived before the scheduled delivery date. i've been using it for a little over a week now and i love it. it looks and works as if it were brand new. i'm very happy with the results of this purchase .   excellent buy! would definitely recommend- no problems at all .   muy bien. this is good iphone .   cutting edge phone comparable to iphone6s in a smaller package. my daughter loves it .   the only thing was that i didn't receive a tool to put my new sim card in .   as advertised. a+. wonderful. perfect .   it's everything ok. thank you. it was a fraud. the iphone is a iphone 5s. this isn't iphone se. i restore this iphone because i had to install an application to financial security, so when i did this process, i found out that this iphone was other serial and it didn't have 64 gb. it has 16 gb. now i'm trying to return this prodcut but i live in colombia and this countrie there is a law to restrict import/export smartphone. this problem i have and have not do .   good phone. love this phone and remember what i loved about the original hand size iphones .   nice phone .   i got this phone for my wife. it is a great upgrade from her iphone 4s as she doesn't like bigger phones like the 6s or 6 plus .   good .   very good phone. i bought it with a very good price .   just as ordered and on promised time. phone came in excellent condition; unlocked and easy to use. i am loving my phone. had it since may and it is working fine .   right product and fast shipping .   i am very happy and content with my first i phone. a friend recommodated to me and it's above my expertations. so know enjoy evert day the bennefits of this product .   great phone. lots of memory .   the se looks the same apart from the rose gold detail but it's also very new in many ways from the screen resolution to the much improved performance and features. very pleased with it .   excellent delivery. excellent product. excellent enjoyment .   no problems .   good product. product as expected and advertised, exactly the same as would have been obtained at an apple store .   excellent. it is not "unlocked", a waste of time & money .   it is great, runs well hold all my music, camera is great, got apple care plus for two years! all the features of a iphone 6 without the bulky size. great phone .   is small and confortable. just that i need. phone was network locked and did not meet my expectations at all .  aweful service .   love this phone it's worth the money. the phone is really nice. i like how i can have a small phone and have the latest technology inside it .   it's fake iphone do not buy from this market, anything has given me a chinese phone. all good. fast phone and good bettery life. dont need big screen because have an ipad .   todo ok. right size with perfect perfomance. amazing .   it is perfect .   meets my expectations surely. like like like. dear to whom it may concern that the iphone charger for the walk jack are way to big that i couldn't be able plug it in on my house jack. so is there a way that you could send me another one that would be a able to plug in my wall jack and be able to charge my phone. yes it did meet my espectation . i love it .   superb .   ok. it came on time and it works great. not unlocked for any carrier .   i can't use it on sprint, what a waste of time and money. not said as listed and not factory unlocked .   i like it .   very good .   yes. iphone stopped working i am in venezuela and difficult to send me , i have no possibilities of similar equipment compar. i am writing through my new iphone se. no problems with it, it was unblocked and in its package sealed. thanks .   i upgraded to the iphone 6 when it came out (i needed to test a few apps on the larger screen) and then last year i thought, "if i get the plus, i can have an even better reading/watching experience". after 6 months, i'm ditching my 6s+ and i'm loving this phone! it's so small and light it almost feels like a toy, and i don't need a case to keep from dropping it .   was not actually unlocked. it was verizon .   phone met all my expectations. the technology is great. i only had one disappointment - my inability to transfer my contacts from my old phone - a samsung galaxy to the iphone but that may be due to my own technological unsophistication  .   it's hard to meet my expectations but this product did. arrived fast and safe. so far so good .   good .  this phone works according our expectations. i really like my new iphone. fairly easy to use, and takes very clear pics. the reason i gave it only 4 stars is because of the price, i think paying this much money for a phone is crazy .  but here i am being crazy  .   the reception on this phone is terrible. mt previous phone was an iphone 5s which had much better reception. something is wrong with phone. i'm on verizon. in places where my 5s got consistently good reception this phone is lucky to get one dot. same plastic case on both phones .   almost perfect, didn't come with sim door key had to open the sim tray with a coaxial connector pin .   everything good. however they didn't bring me the tool to open the chip conteiner. perfect. fast, reliable, good battery life. quality phone .   i liked it. awful reception no matter where i go. only time i get something resembling reception is near a cellular antenna. phone is clearly defective. now i need to tolerate this as i can't go without a phone. no service to 1 bar everywhere i go .   not sure what to say negative about any iphone because i love them! anyway the product that i bought match the description and i have no problems using the phone two seconds after i open the package. great, great, great experience .   perfect. not an unlocked phone .   excellent. it's a great iphone at a great price. love it .   it works great, got here before expected time, well sealed an packaged. would buy again. ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. bogus phone. not unlocked. is a locked trac phone .   it was in an excellent condition .   the phone was exactly like the seller said 100% satisfied. good. i received my iphone se in great condition! the packaging was awesome & it was indeed new .   after having a terrible experience from an iphone 6plus a week ago, i decided to order this one and this was by far the best phone ever! thank you so much .   good. all ok. good product. it's awesome. is locked with verizon , not unlocked  .   much faster than 5s. nice iphone it misses the 3d touch and more stronger front camera  .   goooooood. great phone for international use. compatible with every network i have used so far .   the iphone se is great. it has great speed, and battery life. the camera is 4k, and takes bright clear pictures. the web browsing is smooth and quick .   my daughter loves it works great. super first shipment was right on time .   wow! love size and higher build quality of the se! i switched back from the iphone 6s and have no regretsðÿ˜ž. great seller and fast shipping .   the camera isn't better than the older version of the iphone .   classy. everything was good. if u like 6s and u dont like its size, get se. cute phone and fast deliver. good. excellent. apple always make excellent product. ok. outstanding phone, same as other apple phones features only smaller. love this phone. bravo .   ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. pretty good in general. great phone. a little expensive but it is because is apple. thanks deliver on time really international unlocked. great  .   its wonderfoul .   everything was perfectly in order. muy buen producto .   biggest mistake i ever made. i was sent the wrong phone, the charger was european and it was set up before with someone's icloud info on it. i paid for overnight on 4/20 and finally got it 5/4. i took it to the apple store and it would not ever work here or on at&t .   only bought this new phone as an upgrade to my iphone 4 .   like. this iphone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's "retro" design remembering the 5s. it feels nostalgic because 10 years ago i used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos. when smartphones became more powerful with better cameras i still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money. the se makes the iphone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to "upgrade" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. the pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. that was i was looking for. speaking about software, wow what can i say that hasn't been told already? ios is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something i appreciate a lot. with android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but ios is the king of "smoothness". i've even seen 5 years old iphone devices working still like the first time. i don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because i don't watch much video on my phones, i'm minimalist so i just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it. the battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours. typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something i can live with .   good phone from a good seller .   grat product, gract presentation, it comes with all that you need for install. excelent. perfect. long time not use a iphone. as the high price until this one.phone is good,faster than 5s.i tried the game modern combate 5 on iphone se and my samsung galaxy s7,load the game and load the mission,iphone se made them faster than s7 about 3 secs.and the fingerprint unlock is almost the same,please note that if you use the iphone se oftenly,it unlocks the screen very fast,if you don't it will take 1-2secs more to get it done.and the only thing i don't like is upside of the screen is yellow,just a little than the other parte of the screen.it is a hardware issue,maybe apple using the screens of 5s to their iphone se.those screen are new but born 2 years ago.so i gave it 4 stars for this issue,not a big deal but you can tell.hope this would help you .   since so far i am the only reviewer with an iphone se, i see it as my duty to present this iphone to you. yes, i do have this phone (sorry i have in rose gold, but workmanship is the same) and i am writing a real review (pictures provided!). okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4" iphone is finally here. some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iphone 5 and 5s. literally the exact same. unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iphone 6, this iphone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iphone 5 and 5s. really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed. the next point was that this phone is better than the iphone 6 (and much cheaper). don't let the 4" screen fool you, this iphone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iphone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iphone 6. a9 chip, better and faster than the a8 in the iphone 6. if pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel isight camera, better than the one in the iphone 6. don't forget improved noise reduction, also better than the iphone 6. don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iphone 6's 43 megapixels. oh, and i almost forgot (not really), 4k video is a blast. for selfies, the iphone se now features retina flash, or flash from the screen. battery life: the iphone se has the best battery life of all iphone for sale today in terms of internet use time. so should you upgrade? i will start with those without a contract. if you hold any iphone with a 4" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. this includes current users of iphone 1/3g/3gs/4/4s/5/5c/5s. here's why. if you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. given that you were able to afford a full price iphone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. the way i see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iphone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3d touch). iphone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. you really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, i pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. this one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide. those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. but, since you are shopping on amazon for this phone, i assume you are not in a contract. however, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over. i hope you enjoyed reading this review more than i enjoyed writing it. if you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. i, however, am not a representative from apple, and you might just get better answers there. who knows .   it started having problems functioning and restarting after a few months. flash not working and light blinks off and on when plugged to charger. great phone better that expected , works great with absolutely no issues. looks almost new. arrived on time. however no cell phone charger came with the box .   all of the cell phones i reviewed had a cell phone charger included so i thought it was general practice to include this with the cell phone .   bought verizon phone new. took it to verizon to get everything switched over from old phone. found out it wasn't able to connect to internet. very disappointed .   worked gr eat for awhile but now wont even turn on. paid a lot of money for it not to last long. it was not funtional. lost the money .   happy to have a new phone and happier it isn't a 7. item only lasted two months. when returned to samsung we were told repair was not covered. phone doesn't pick up service in areas it should. won't stay connected to wifi. returned phone .   for a use divice i will give a 5 start, there was not signe of use at all. verry happy it come with all accesories, cant ask for more. the charge was not compactible with it but work on my others divices. great deal here. thanks .   i really love the galaxy note 3 and i have had absolutely no problems with it. it does everything and more. i am sorry the newest version (7) has been such a disaster, but i think there must have been a flaw in the sealed waterproof design. i am so glad i settled on the older version, tried and true, for less money, and virtually no down side at all. the galaxy note 3 phone is such an awesome phone i feel very badly for the company at this time. also the company which sent it, did so quickly. arrived earlier than expected .   good. quickly shipped, great product. perfect. it's not very good at charging and has some issues but other than that it's a good phone. great phone. works great well worth the money. the pen works great, the screen is just small enough to use one hand if needed but big enough for a descent view. when i looked up some extras on it i found its definitely capable of people who love speed. battery life is long for an android with this much power. many options on this phone .   very nice. my favorite phone ever! broke 1 and bought same again :) do not want to upgrade it ever! lol. still working like a charm, i finally made to the 21st century .   lcd screen went out after only a month .   enjoying. this phone works really great. it runs all the latest apps with no freezing or slowdowns. the screen is bright and very sharp. both the front and rear cameras work well, and the flash doubles as a very bright flashlight. i've dropped it and sat on it and even dunked it in the swing pool. it still works flawlessly .   as of right now it's more of a paper weight. not able to use at all with out sim card .   bought for prepaid phone .   looked at online was under the impression could switch it over from my galaxy 3 best value for price has under skirt to hide the goodshitch has no sim card .   when i receive this device i have many options this was the more expensive for replacing my device only reason why i was getting the new samsung phone was because my device has stopped charging so i purchased a charger so that i can charge the battery as well as the phone app on received device i noticed that the screen did not display the actual time as well as it did not charge the phone the original charger for the samsung note was not in the box i received the secondary charger that does not work to charge the phone advised that the merchant please send a new phone and i would send the other back because i didn't want to be without a cell phone i never received any other information regarding my request since then i have purchased batteries so that i can swap the batteries out and charge them through the charger that i purchase that will allow me to charge the battery it's real inconvenient because now i have to spend more money and my phone is not under warranty and i don't want to be without a phone i think that the merchant could have sent out another phone or a new charger to accommodate my situation never again will i purchase devices from this month. this phone is so scratched up. if i knew it looked like this i would have never bought this. i'm so pissed. and not once do i see that this was a used phone .   this product arrived as scheduled. it would not work for mobile data. phone, gps, and wifi worked. i ended up using this as a remote for my tv since my galaxy s7 doesn't have that capability. it is fine as a back-up gps on my boat .   this note 3 used but appeared practically brand new. it exceeded my expectations and at the best price i found .   love this phone, it serves perfectly for a college student for small projects and keeping up with appointments and projects .   when i ordered this item it was said to take about two to three weeks to come in. to my suprise it took only about 5 days for the item to arive. the quality of the product was exactly as posted 9 out of 10. not a single scratch, dent, or blemish from my evaluation. everything has worked perfectly from the time i opened it put of the box, and i received exactly why was promised. my girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic $40.00 go phone that could be purchased for her carrier, and what we got was many folds greater. s pen was perfect. phone was without a blemish. she literally can't stop taken pictures with this phone because samsungs camers rock. the only down side that i would have to say is that the battery performance is quite poor, but that would be expected if it was the original battery that game with the phone on a older model. i plan on buying a battery for a good deal off amazon for this phone in new condition, which should fix all off her problems i rated this 5 stars to be nice, but in all reality i would give this a 4 out of 5 for the lack of battery porformance. thanks for saving me money once again amazon. ^.^. i am not recommend the battery is not working enough. works well. still had the original stylus. perfect size for me now. my only issue is that i read the description and it average wear and tear. this phone had more wear and tear than any phone that i had ever owned for multiple years. i cannot go without a case around the edges because it is so heavily scratched and chipped that it is literally not comfortable to hold on to. i suggest that they submit actual pictures of the item when posting, not just the factory model picture from the website. average wear and tear is a very misleading statement in this case. other than that, it's a good phone. i like it alot .   works as expected :-). great phone was sent fast and as advertised. great experience. will always use this service from now on .   great seller .   phone looked like it was brand new. switched sim card, up in running in 5 min .   wonderful phone. i was concerned about buying from a 3rd party but verizon treated me like they sold it to me .   just as described .   better than note 4 .  battery life was awesome .   upgrading from my iphone 4 because i direly missed my samsung galaxy. decided to give it a try and i absolutely love the larger screen and clear display. activated this phone with prepaid verizon with no problems. the 1-day mail device was right in time and reasonably priced. thank you .   amazingly this works with tracfone. before we used a iphone 4s verizon, bought from amazon and transferred to tracfone byop successfully and everything still works today. didn't know of tracfone's changes, so now it's at&t, unlocked phones, t-mobile, and some other various carriers that can be brought into byop, not verizon! (as it was a byop carrier before) transfer: old tracfone cellphone to this newer samsung. already had a sim card meant for the process. (strangely before the iphone 4s didn't need a sim card, still doesn't have one, but still on that tracfone plan for the iphone). the byop process didn't work right away when we tried transferring it online. called tracfone for assistance, blah blah provided information, this that, op nope your phone isn't compatible with tracfone sorry, and bye. however, we tried transferring online again and it worked successfully .   results: it uses at&t cell towers, makes calls and everything successfully, image transfers through text messages is iffy since it can't send multiple images in bulk. just make sure to go through the steps listed for byop, do it once or twice and image transfer along with data usage should work fine .   thank you .   it was more then said. excellent. was great i love it. purchased to replace an old iphone 4. love this phone. great features and quality for the price. i also like the android system much better. great value .   yes good price good phone .   awsome thank you works like new  .   works as expected i am satisfied. phone freezes a lot and shuts off randomly. couldn't get any service, had to get a new phone from the store (which works great now) didn't mind the minor chips in the sides, but was a total waste of $ .   love this purchase! looks and works perfect .   nice phone right size for the many things i have to do on hand. amazing condition. the phone looked brand new, the only way i could tell it was refurbished was the packaging. works great and i am very happy with the purchase .   this was a really terrible phone, and after 1.5 yrs of suffering with it i finally switched back to my old iphone 4s and felt like i performed a major upgrade .   i am appalled at a large company like samsung for even releasing such a thing onto the market, and the fact that this is a third generation product is completely shameful. the device hardly functions as a phone even, and it overheats insanely (which also burns its own batteries so it doesn't last even half a day)-- frankly if i had energy i would have claimed an ftc complaint or something because i bought a device for a lot of money thinking that it would be a phone and also a capable mobile computing device and instead received a heavy brick that gets no reception and has no battery to make calls and tries to scorch my skin through the pant pocket .   seriously this makes me wonder if there is a single samsung engineer that actually tried this product .   replaces my old one which died. way cheaper than the new samsung s7 edge which i also purchased and just as functional. i will use it as backup if the s7 breaks. the devices are so sophisticated that i can easily get by with a device a couple of years out of date now. i really don't need much higher than full hd resolution and the micro sd slot takes just as much memory 128 gb as the s7. plus i already had extra batteries and charger from the old one. i have to be really careful not to damage the s7 battery by over discharging, the note 3, i just get a new $20 or less battery .   the phone is way better than i dared hope for! several local sellers in the tampa bay area handle this style of phone but i loved amazon's 30-day back promise, and felt much safer ordering through amazon. and all this time i have spent looking for a replacement for my samsung note 2 i never once thought of amazon! you guys rock .   phone looks flawless , however it will not charge properly, even when it says its plunged in and charging the phone off it will not increase inpercentagre of battery life , update , after reading up on the problem i decided to try another samsung cable and spent $20 at the local store for a new one , now the phone charges with no problems .   i never rate anything that i buy, but since i was so skeptical about this phone i feel that it is necessary. it works absolutely perfect. i was scared when i first got it. the screen was black and it would not turn on, but i realized quickly that the battery was just dead. the camera works great. no complaints .   buy it if you want it .   best phone i've had in a long time. was stated in "ok" condition, was in awesome condition in my opinion .   for the most part i am really enjoying this as it's my first foray into this type of product. it's been fun to use and learn all the things it can do .   i like. i'm really liking my phone there are a lot of features i still need to learn .   i haven't had any problem with my note 3 so far and i love it. love it. great phone. i just wanted the latest version. nice phone. very happy with my product .   good. camera flash doesn't work and it freezes a lot. love the screen size, but the phone not so much. barley made it through 30 days without phone having issues .   received phone, charged on my bedside table over night, used for 12 hours with phone in my console. i tried plugging it in last night before bed and nothing. i had my first note 3 for a year and loved the phone, i was pretty excited to get this and was severely disappointed. i have a custody hearing today via telephone because the mother killed herself 2000 miles away and we are in the middle of transferring that over. thanks for a perfectly disappointing phone, if need be, i can post screen shots from the social worker 2 times zones away .   why do i even pay for this service anyway? i mean, i haven't gotten anything in a couple of days in a long time. ordered april 26th, received may 2nd, dead on may 3rd .   you can't trust people with your money at all anymore .   perfect condition. very happy. i love my new phone. i definitely would buy from this seller again and will give recommendations .   loving my pre own samsung galaxy note 3. no problems for the last two month's. had a few marks on the phone. had to get a new battery here on amazon since the one it came with was pretty dead .   love my galaxy note .   i bought this for my son and he loves it. the phone is very good for my purposes. the charger was not original and charges very slowly .   amazing phone. love it .   so far this has been a great phone. purchased used on amazon. i've had it for about 5 months and i really like it. i hate to pay retail for anything, so this is great. it is working smoothly on a 3rd party verizon network. i will probably buy my next phone the same way .   was new really. just 2 chips in the chrome. the rest brand new. love the phone. hesitant to write a review until a couple months had passed in case of product failure but here i go. visually the phone was in great condition besides a few spots about 1mm in length in the lower right bezzel where the plastic has been chipped. everything came as described and in working condition, i was able to pop my sim csrd in and activste it thr same day. in the past month, i've experienced a few kinks in the os like the touchscreen not responding for a few seconds and ohone froze once but nothing that a restart couldn't fix. i dont think that this is a problem with the phone but just a byproduct of its aging (3 year old) componants. but these things only happened twice in the last month after heavy usage so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt. overall, getting this phone with its processing power and display was a very good deal for under $200. despite its age it functions are fluid and dont seem to be slowing down at the moment. would definately suggest getting a case despite the fact that i've dropped it a few times without one and have yet to get any scratches .   it's ok but need a good battery and not enough memorize enough space by speed. so, far so good. not had any problems yet  .   phone is in good condition. works very well. i am very happy .   it did not come with the correct charging cord so i had to get a cord. it holds a charge much better now .   this is a great phone but the flash light does not work. this is the phone i have always wanted. i had to give it 2 stars because everything works except for the light. this light is for the flash when taking pictures or when trying to use the phone for a flash light .   the description for the phone i bought said "very good" in the description. i was expecting a phone with a few nicks maybe a scratch but i received a phone with a cracked case and very bad chips on the edges of the phone .   love it. the screen is huge! the graphics and details in the background are outstanding .   i have had my battery charged at 100% since i woke up this morning and i am just now on 75%. i work from home on my phone and i am on my phone 90% of the time so that says a lot about the battery usage .   will definitely be keeping this phone .   excellent smartphone it's like new .   very happy with purchase and delivery was promt. great deal in amazin. saved 100 bucks against going into store. will buy next one on here also. phone works great but i would say the phone was in good condition if not a bit lower. there are a lot of chips on the chrome trim around the screen. the back leather part has a few scratches on the back, fading around the camera, and looks like fading all in the middle, it kind of looks like there is dust all over the back that wont come off. i will post pictures in a bit .   phone came on time and as described in great cosmetic condition and working condition. screen has a crack. great phone. a ton of bloatware but whatever. still an amazing phone for the price .   if the phone worked correctly it would have received 5 stars. i got the phone on time. i charged it for 3 hours using multiple chargers only to find out they sent me a phone with a defective charging port .   wifi wire was broke, could not get it fixed so i had to buy a new phone from the cell companies. great product .   i received my samsung galaxy note 3 it was noted as very good condition it was like mint i love it it's a beast of a phone worth every penny it's huge i will never upgrade from this phone. great phone and in great shape .   it was great phone ever but i just come to lost it 2 days ago it failed on the floor. lots of scratches paint on the side chipped all over i bought a new one and the back cover was chipped at the bottom but the phone works perfectly. works perfectly! i'd buy again .   everything was good even though it was a used phone. the phone was working perfectly fine until today. i only had the phone for a week and the phone completely blacked out. i have never dropped the phone and just simply put it inside my backpack and when i took it out to check the time the screen was completely blacked out on the inside and the outside looked fine with no scratches. definitely wouldnt recommond to buy. i would like to buy another. good. great phone love it. phone came good condition and with charger however was missing the battery and the usb cable. brought galaxy note 3 as a replacement for my wife's iphone 5. at fist she wasn't to sure since it was a big change. now that she has been using it she is in love with it. she can now do things for her job much easier than the previous phone she had .   i love my new phone .   thank you so much .   you guys rock .   :d. this phone is great. it's nice enough to where you don't think of it as an "old phone", and the stylus is pretty cool too. the bigger screen really makes using the phone easier and honestly more likable. surprisingly good battery life .   wonderful phone. enjoying it very much. i love this phone .   i have had it for a week now with no problems. although i had to go buy another charger because the one that was sent was the wrong one and kinda cheap quality. other than that the price i paid for this phone was great .   highly recommend .   phone was in pretty good shape. lcm was immaculate. only one minor scuff on the frame. was going in an otterbox anyway so no biggie. also, delivery exceeded my expectations. thanks .   excellent. great price!everything i had hoped for .   better than expected. practicality brand new! not one scratch found! had i not knowing it was a refurbishment i'd of never guessed besides the generic charger. i highly recommend this phone its large and does much more than i can think of .   phone in working condition as stated but charger is broken. worth the money, love this phone. i'll never go back to a droid again .   amazing phone, looks just like new. came in, turned on, and was ready to be activated. at an awesome price and more than i could have hoped for. couldn't be happier .   phone was like new works great. i have only had the phone for a short time so far,but everything is working well and it was in great condition when i received it .   great! and it arrived several days early. i loved this phone for the first 6 months, it worked great for first year and then it was all downhill from there. it barely works now and i've done a full reformat. the worst part is that it fails miserably as a phone. reception is terrible, i miss calls and messages all the time, it locks up and won't let me pickup calls, i just had to power down the phone to hang up on a call, etc .   works as it should few nicks. we love. phone stopped working shortly after i had set it up. screen remained black even though the back and navigation buttons turn on. flashes white for less than a second whenever i attempt to restart it. defective. returning immediately .   great phone. worked and look just like advertised .   this is a very good phone it came looking brand new and it works very fast i had no issues getting it activated on a prepaid account through verizon wireless i absolutely love the storage and the way the phone works it was definitely worth the money .   no lte so many problems i don't know why. little scratch but it is fine. i havent gotten the chance to activate it just yet, (waiting for my vsk to come in the mail.) but the phone itself is in almost perfect condition and its working perfectly. i love it. update: i got my verizon sim kit. it took me less than 15 minutes to activate and my phone is working perfectly. i love it .   how many ways can i say i love this phone .   i needed a new phone because my other verizon phone was on its way out. i did not want to sign up for another two year contract nor did i want to "rent" a phone for the next two years. so while doing my research and asking around, i came to discover that this phone is capable of having the battery changed. well, that was a great selling point since my previous phone was only lasting half a day without needing to be recharged. unfortunately, many phones today cannot have their batteries replaced when they are getting older,that is why the samsung galaxy note 3 was so appealing to me. in addition, i am no youngster and need a big screen to see and this phone is perfect for that. it feels great in my hands and so far i am really enjoying using it. it was a great choice .   i should have waited a day more to write this review. phone was in perfect condition when i recieved. have had it for a month now it seemed to be working okay. sometimes applications like gallery stopped and it was not much of a bother. i like it so far until right after posting my review. now i can't hear anything when i call or when somebody calls me. i have to connect a bluetooth device before i'll b able to hear. even that, i'll have to repeat myself a couple times before the other party will hear me .  now i'm really worried and don't know what to do. phone wad supposed to work like new and not refurbished. phone never cease disappointing me .  i connected my phone to charge and it keep going low instead of charging up. now it wouldn't charge at all .  i hope all new battery or charger will fix me all up. i can't imagine having to get a new phone .   the phone is just ok. it has a week a antenna, i hardly every get one bar from my house. the back cover is cheap. you need to re-start the phone everyday to resolve weird issues. i don't recommend it .   great phone for the money. even today, i see people selling this phone for much more on craigslist / facebook. my phone came with nothing but a charger, no factory box or instructions. it is very large and hard to handle, especially while driving, but the screen is awesome. i love the exterior feel and finish. it is a shame to cover it up with a case, but with a phone this big, it will get dropped. good deal and a good phone .   the device i received had a bad battery. i was not able to explore and enjoy the phone before it gave me problems .   pen was broken. and the top outer case is broken off. but it works good .   no stylus. works perfectly! just put in my sim card and was good to go .   the battery life is fantastic. he always had problems with batteries, but this one withstands his frequent use of the phone. love the product. wish it would have came with the charger that is meant for it, but overall wonderful .   everything i had hoped for. verizon was not able to activate phone .   everything looks great. it looks slightly used but the screen is perfect and the back is perfect condition .   as advertised. it is exactly as it was described. it works perfectly, with minor scratches. it came with all the necessary items to use for a day to day basis. the cell phone company had no issue of making this phone my primiary cell phone .   touch screen freezes in certain spots of the screen and i have to reboot it all the time. excellent work .  thanx seller. phone arrived as promised. it was purchased in very good condition and it looked brand new! the sides of the screen don't seem to work as well as the rest, but overall i am very satisfied with the purchase  .   ordered a used phone in "acceptable" condition. listing said it has a bunch of scratches on it. i can honestly say this phone hardly looks used! it has some normal wear on the edges, but looks great otherwise. as for the phone itself, i am blown away by how fast and smooth the apps run, and by how crisp the pictures look. i've been using the cheap prepaid phones for years now, and this one blows it out of the water. i love the size and the pen feature is great. i can't wait to see what else this phone can do  .   the phone and all of its features worked just fine. was in good cosmetic condition. but it would not connect to the verizon network, i went to 3 diffferent verizon locations to activate this phone on my plan. the third store finally told me that the phone did not have an imei number at all. therefore it was not a verizon device .   a great phone. the stylus can be very useful when it's cold out .   for a used phone, it looked good upon arrival. it has worked prefect ever since i got the phone activated .   great. this machine was far from outdated. will not replace it hopefully for a long time. yeah like it  .  alot .   so far so good! the charger plug did not work but i have extra one @ home to charge the phone. phone was in excellent condition. week later: this phone is a blast to use! glad i bought it and didn't break the bank .   best phone ever. in perfect condition just like new except the stylus is not the one with the soft changeable tip that the phone originally came with. stylus still works fine for my daughter since she had never used the other one before .   i am very satisfied over half a year after purchase. it was surprisingly easy to have verizon connect my new phone. this is legit. i lucked out by getting the phone (an older model) for way cheaper than what i found elsewhere and am very happy. thank you .   i like the product so far. great phone. linked right up to verizon prepaid. phone lasted 60 days after paying $200+. phone stopped charging. i never used this phone since i bought, was not charging. this phone is awesome, awesome, awesome! a++++ seller. after several months of using the phone, i've decided to make my review. first off, i noticed the orientation sensor was not working correctly. the camera is stuck in landscape, so i have to manually rotate pics on edit before sharing them. i recently had to do a factory reset because i woke up one day and the time on the phone was off by 1 hour and 8 minutes .  it was very strange. i tried everything i could think of before deciding a reset was necessary. in the process now of getting everything back to way i had it before. eliminating some apps that might have caused the problem. also, after a reset at time i received phone and this recent one, the orientation is still not working. i have checked numerous sites looking for answers to this issue with no workable solutions. any help in this area would be appreciated. outside of these issues the phone is exactly what i wanted when i ordered it .   great phone. looking forward to the note 5 .   great phone, love it. thank u .  its perfect. cant use new snapchat or samsung pay. i hate my s5 busted before time to renew forcing me to buy a new ohone but no wat i cold aford the s5 or s6. but i had this type phone before and love it, perfect for keeping up with all i need and i like it bigger cause i like to read alot. so a bigger screen is perfect for the kindle app. i'm very happy with my new phone. it came quickly and in excellent shape. no scratches on the screen. a little dent on the side. but i was made aware there might be wear and tear. it doesn't inhibit my use on the phone in anyway. the pen is also a cool feature and works great .   i love this phone. not too big, not too small, and fairly easy to navigate if you are used to android phones .   everything came as advertised. very happy with my new phone .   had my samsung note3 used for three days now am loving it no problem with it. i have quickly come to find the size of the screen to be far superior to my old s3. i would never go back to a smaller phone's screen. the note 3 is very detailed, colors are vibrant and i see no pixels even when the image is magnified. i was a bot reluctant to buy a refurbished phone, but breed sent a phone indistinguishable from new. also, the accessories for an older model are far cheaper than the new note 5. as for the note 5, the lack of a removable battery and sd card were deal breakers for me .   i absolutely loved the phone and would have given it 4 or 5 stars  .   until  .   i made the horrible and could be very dangerous mistake of "upgrading" the system per the prompts  .   now many times i am unable to connect to the network, cannot make calls, cannot text, in other words the basic things you have a mobile phone for are useless. i sure hope i am not out late somewhere and stranded by the side of the road when this happens! of course there is no way to undo the "upgrade" to the operating system, i am now stuck with this phone that way too often does not work at all. worse yet, from what i understand the manufacturer knows this is an issue with this upgrade and yet they are offering no fix, no upgrade to this horrible upgrade. why? i guess they want everyone who made the mistake of approving the prompted upgrade to just buy a new phone! maybe a note 4? anyway, if they cannot be bothered to fix what could be a dangerous situation (out late with no phone service) then i will purchase another phone from another manufacturer next time. until then, because this was so expensive, i will just have to hope i am never in a life or death or emergency situation and have "no network connection" .   love it. im glad i selected this phone. still alot to learn but glad i have it .   excellent .   horrible. the phone did not work, i had to buy another one .   concerned the product was sold as new and believe it is refurbished - only had couple months and already having issues, son mad at me - (yes he is an it and works on these - he has a note 4) feels it was misrepresented .   great phone .   was actually like new .   no was delivered on time .   greatttt purchase ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜˜ðÿ˜˜. excellent condition .   great item was just like described thanks so much .   the edges all around the phone are all jacked up i didn't say that on the review until i had already purchased it really pissed about but oh well it is what it is. the note 3 has been my favorite smart phone .   couldn't ask for a better price. a life saver. love it. awesome phone. awesome seller. everything came perfectly fine. no issues at all .   good shipping i love the phone i can't complain. i bought this phone for my brother and so far so good. i myself own one so i'm pretty satisfied with its performance. really this phone doesn't even deserve one star. all we could do is make calls and text nothing else it useless. ordered for my son he so disappointed. sent it back. the phone was as promised. in very good condition, it functioned as it is supposed to. it came with a charger/ cord and stylus. easy transfer of account etc .   excellent product .   phone was in perfect condition .   love, love, love this phone. it was cheaper on here then buying it through verizon. i received it quickly and was able to quickly and easily get it set up. this phone works great, i haven't had any major problems with it. the only problems i have had are typical phone problems like it freezing up on me; but after taking the battery out and turning it back on it is fine again and that hasn't even happened as often as other phones i've had. my previous phone was the lg g2, i think the note 3 is a million times better .   excellent. works great .   phone was defective. it wouldn't send text messages and if it did make a call it would drop. i couldn't use it in the am at all. it didnt work at home at all. weirdest thing .  i heard nothing but good things about it too. so i decided to purchase the galaxy 5 and absolutely love it. the sellers are working with me on the return of the note 3 .   overall the product was good. the only bad thing about the phone is that it came with the wrong battery. i would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for that. so i ended up having to purchase a battery for it which meant i had to wait another week or so to get it .   it's a great phone. my only complaint is that the phone resets itself, phone back up won't work, and occasionally the lock screen will replace the numbers and alphabets with white square boxes .   works great. the phone is nice. but i should have just got the note 4 .   its not working properly. one of the best android phones out there. it only takes about a half hour to charge and takes almost two days to be completely dead. atleast, that is how it is for me. i have had this phone for about four years. jumping from phone service carrier to other phone service carriers and i still enjoy it. even though i had repurchased it again when switching to a different phone service provider because i loved it so much. if your looking for an electronic, easy access hand notebook with a efficient camera and a strong battery, this is a great phone choice for you .   product was most satisfactory .  appreciate your promptness as well .  thank you so much .   this phone came exactly on time and was more than i had expected. there wasn't a single scratch on the screen and hardly even a scuff on the frame. the only signs of wear were on the camera housing but do not effect the camera whatsoever. even the back shows no signs of wear. this was more than excellent condition .   too many things to list. i love this phone .   love it. good smart phone. i bought this phone once i saw that you can link up with verizon through amazon to do your upgrade. i loved this phone when i first got it and almost two years later i still love it so much. with how often i abuse this phone by randomly dropping it and whatnot, it's a very durable and trustworthy phone. when i upgrade again, i'd love to go through amazon/verizon again to get the newest version of the note .   nice phone. amazing phone .   arrived a day or so of actual day. loving the phone, in great condition! only down side is that it did not come with a chip, but thankfully i had one from my previous phone .   very good looking and solid phone. almost like new. no issues in the first 4 months. good price. i like it even more than the note 2 that it replaced. the screen is slightly bigger than the note 2 screen .   i switched from a samsung galaxy 5 to a galaxy note 3 after having my previous phone stolen - good times. i didn't want to pay much for my stupidity. but if i had to do it again, i would have opted for the note 4 because of the camera lens, processing speed, and application quality despite the additional costs. i love the on-screen writing and use it all the time to avoid the other text entry. i get a lot of "oh my god that's huge!" when i take the phone out but i also like the larger screen so i don't have to stress my eyes. i will adopt the note 4 or the note 5 if it exists the next time i renew my contract. very nice phone .   did not have a charger. worked fine and still looked like new. loving this new phone! i can actually see the screen! was a little worried bout buying a used phone but so far it's working well except for a freeze up every now and then, but not enough to be annoying. it's been a great phone so far .   this review is for the note 3 in general, but also as a recommendation for laptopangels if that happens to be the seller somebody might be looking at. i gave laptopangels a 5-star review for sales and shipping, as well as for handling a return with courteous professionalism. the phone: the phone, the phone, the phone. i take back every bad thing i've ever said about samsung. the 2-year-old note 3 stacks right up there with every 2015 phone i've had my hands on. my daily driver is a droid turbo, and this note 3 is every bit as much fun to "drive" as my turbo is. i should qualify by saying that the note 3 we eventually bought is still running kitkat 4.4.2 (so i can't speak for this phone with lollipop 5.x installed) and we plan to keep it on kitkat .   one big reason we were in the market for an older phone was an increasingly *severe* dislike for lollipop. basically, this phone replaces a new lg g4 with 5.1 (which replaced a g3 with 5.0) and the new owner could not be any happier. she had a galaxy note ii before, and it croaked, which was the only reason she needed another phone. it was my mistake to steer her toward lg; should've considered the note 3 in the first place. samsung definitely got it right with this one .   nice phone, very reliable. goog. the phone wasn't deactivated from previous owner. so i returned it and was promptly refunded. otherwise. the phone would have been a good purchase .   awesome purchase .   its awesome as usual. i lost my old one and this one slipped right into its spot perfectly. had for a few months now and it is great. i doubt if i will ever buy from the store again. great phone! battery last me all day. would recommend to anyone .   perfect. way better than my old lg g2. if you use your phone a lot, like i do, then it wouldn't hurt to invest in a couple of extra batteries. other then that, phone is great: no lagging, no crashing of any kind .   great phone. and in great condition .   this phone arrived in excellent working condition. cosmetically it is in very good condition as well. i'm very happy with this purchase, thank you .   has a weird glitch once in a while but i can deal with it .   phone does not work :(. i love my phone. do not be afraid to buy refurbished .   very satisfied customer .   great phone! suoer fast and bright color can't complain about the note 3. can't wait for the note 5! i just hope it come with a removable battery and sd card slot .   this came right on time and made transfering over contacts easy. perfect phone well constructed and bigger screen for my husbands tired eyes. he swears he will nevwr go back to iphones again .   it is a steep learning curve expecially for oldsters of diminishing capacity; but it is fun too. it is not very loud and i cannot really get the volume any higher no matter what i've tried .   good size for long fingers. extremely light and thin (until the case, that is). great screen, although washout is still a problem in the sunlight. very nice photos. strange tendency to fail to get phone signal after i leave my company wifi (reboot fixes this). call quality is ok, but speakerphone is quite clear. like that speaker is on bottom, rather than back. decent, but not exceptional, battery life .   i hate this phone .   galaxy note 3 phone if u have a s4s5 or s6 why this phone is the bome u take a pic add it to ur calendar or copy ur work schedule and keep track of ur hrs for work .   with the pen when this phone was made they out did them self. best phone ever and will never chance phone again .   bought this for my wife who finally escaped from at&t and moved to a family plan on verizon with me. she loves it. maybe not as much as i love mine, but a lot. as far as i'm concerned, this is the best smart phone ever made. period. small enough to fit in a front shirt pocket but big enough for reading a kindle ebook (using the app). i've even signed papers for the faa using the stylus and sent them off. just an amazing device .   have been wanting to get this product for some time. its everything that i need to do my job better. i don't regret buying an older model. i do regret not using my other samsung products more like my note pro 12.2 and note 8.0. great product .   best phone i've had so far. switched from at&t to verizon with this phone, and glad i did, customer service has been excellent. there were problems with overheating and the battery draining quickly - which you can see via an internet search - verizon replaced the phone, but i found that the problem really seems tied to google updating/syncing photos and videos - once i turned that off (and only do it on demand and when plugged in) the problem seems solved. have not been thrilled by the note feature, but that is probably just my ignorance. excellent camera, and i love the google voice search/response feature (of course, that's an android, not just the note 3). i am fairly careful with my phones, so haven't put a screensaver on it, nor do i use a case (most of the time) due to the weight - and find the phone and screen to be pretty durable, it still looks like new after about 2 years. it's large, and rather unwieldy, but for my old eyes, ability to see things on the screen makes up for it! it is slim and light enough to not be a problem. the sound is really good too, i almost always use the speakerphone on it for making calls, and like the sound when i play music or listen to audio books (and i'm fussy!). i haven't tried other brands, so can't comment on how the note 3 compares, tho i did look at them in the store before settling on this phone. absolutely love this phone - good price and great shipping - very happy with phone, and amazon in general .  would definately recommend both .   purchased may 20. see quote from web site for this phone under technical details:"running the android 4.4 (kitkat) operating system, this phone is locked to the verizon network carrier. *sim card not included.what this means is that if you want root, forget it. it wont happen.also upgraded from a note 2 and 4g lte is much better with note 2 .   for example at the same location, the note 2 shows -95 dbm the note 3 shows -115 dbm. on both both phones when you go below -120 dbm, data link reverts to 3g (or even worse 2g or on the note 3 can show 1xrtt ie. 1g). price was good and setup easy. i did it all on the internet so i never had to call or visit a verizon store. works great and battery life is better than expected .   we had a verizon upgrade coming to us, so i was looking for a all-in-one device for my husband. he just wanted a phone and tablet. i saw a friend with this note 3 and knew he would love it! he checked it out in the store and excited about everything but the price! just as we got our upgrade the note 3 went to $1! i grabbed it! he loves it! the screen is big enough for reading, the phablet is small enough to palm! he only has 1 device to keep track of! he doesn't want a tablet at all now! the note 3 runs on the same android 4.4 as note 4 and if you sign in with samsung they upgrade you to 5.0! between the note 3 and 4 there really isn't a lot of difference, so we went for price. i was going to get one too but the price went back to $100. i was concerned about the size, note has a 5.7 screen, for me to hold on to with the kids in my arms. i got the galaxy s5, with a 5.1 screen, it's only a little smaller and fits my life better! samsung also upgraded s5 to 5.0! the pro and con on note 3 is the size, 5.7 ins. it's prefect for some and to big for others. if you want a all-in-one go with the note, if you want screen size but smaller phone go with s5! i highly recommend both .   awesome phone. love it. i waited over a year for this phone and it was worth the wait! great phone .   phone was received earlier then expected and in great shape! extremely happy with this purchase! thank you .   i loooove this phone. i am so happy i bought it. i can't believe i waited this long. so long flip phone .   best phone/tablet/media devise i bought so far .   i love the samsung galaxy note 3. it's a amazing phone. i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a new phone .   i love â¤ my new phone ðÿ“±â€¦ thank for saving me money ðÿ’°. i am slow to enter the 21st century. this is my first smart phone. i only paid a penny, and i'm very happy with it. it's fairly easy to use. my kids love playing with the pen, drawing on photos, etc. the service is great. the colors are beautiful! i am definitely not an apple fan, but i do like siri better than the s voice. she works better, and all my friends say the voice on my phone is creepy - seductive sounding. i got my brother to change the voice. he's good with technology, and it still took him a while, but it's better .   just what we expected and in great shape .   couldn't be happier. i was nervous about the price being so inexpensive what i wold get. .but it was brand new as advertised from amazon .  great buy .   as advertised. thanks .   love it does everything i wanted and more. love it .   love this phone, had a note 2 before and it was great, this one is even better .   i love this phone. she love it .   what is there to say! perfect .   excellent phone! thanks .   fast shipping, great product, very pleased with everything about transaction .   the phone is exactly what i wanted but i went to use the flash on my camera for the first time and it unfortunately doesn't work :/. awesome phone .   great buy .   own for 19 months and love this phone. works everywhere with verizon service. have had no problem. just finally filled up and now i need an sd card for storage of pics and videos. not hard to hold due to size actually very comfortable. great features .   sd cards won't work but phone has plenty of space. met and exceeded all my expectations. love the large screen .   this did not arrive as anticipated. required signature .   phone does everything i want it to. this is an amazing phone. i love photography and i couldn't afford a camera that i wanted so i was looking for a smartphone with amazing pixels. this phone takes clear photos even zoomed all in or out, and beautiful video quality. a 5 star rating is a must. i will definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a smartphone. (i got it for 19.99 w/ 2yr). as advertised .  :-). what an awesome phone. it is the best .   i bought this and have not regretted it for a moment. everyone is amazed at what this phone can do .   very happy with this phone. love this phone. big and beautiful. still fits in my shirt pocket. the screen is very sharp and the colors are so crisp .   on time and product was great .   love this phone .   loving it .   love, love my phone and was a better price than my service provider offered .   dare i say, the best assistant available. phone, calendar, schedule, note taker, presentation manager, research tool. some things just can't be completed by typing, that's where this tool comes in. simply the best phone there is .   nice phone i had a note 2 the note 3 is way better. love this phone. all good. love it .   much easier to deal with than going to the stores .   havent had any issues with the phone. love these phone. this thing works great .   the screen size is great .  love the pen .  my favorite is the ability to handwrite and have it converted to text .  no problem with battery life .  fits my needs well .   hey don't buy it. mine shuts down and restarts 2 to 4 times a day. nobody wants to resolve the problem .   speed and performance matched all current iphone 6 speeds. excellent cost for such a powerful device. this is my first purchase of a cell phone from amazon. the phone is beautiful and is just what i wanted. the price was right and the delivery time was excellent. the only issue i had was that i did not know that i needed to call verizon first before it would activate. it seems like amazon could mention that step when they sell a new phone. even verizon did not mention it in the accompanying paperwork that came with the phone. after several unsuccessful attempts to activate the phone, which is supposed to be automated, i went to the verizon website and found a number i should call prior to letting the phone run the auto-setup and activate the phone. other than that, i am thrilled with my purchase .   love it .   i don't use the stylus as much as i thought that i would, but i'm never going back to a smaller screen again .   this phone is amazing. the picture is so clear and i watch shows and movies on it all the time. it is a little large, but you get used to it in your pocket and won't know it's there. the stylus is life changing. i can take a screenshot and draw on it and email it for needed edits. the camera is amazing quaility as well. i have owned samsung and lg and nokia and apple phones and after this phone, samsung is my go to. this is a great phone for a woman on the go like me .   nice phone. arrived fast. love love .  absolutely, love this phone .   i am not crazy about verizon. i received my first bill before i had the phone a week. higher that i expected. i was charged an activation fee of an extra $45. the data really goes fast, but i have learned to use wi-fi. still, samsun outdid themselves with this phone. it has a glitch thing about touching the icons and the screen jumps to the next page. still love the phone though. waiting to see when the note 5 comes out. emjoy this phone. i adore this phone so much i'm contemplating selling my 7" samsung galaxy tab and just using this. it does absolutely everything i need it to do, including casual game playing and reading books which is why i bought the tablet in the first place. the screen is large enough, and the adjustments easy enough to find. can't imagine using anything else .   love it. yey. great phone. was skeptical at first because it's an older model. i am glad i bought it. i have both note 4 and note 3 and this is still a great phone at a bargain price .   without getting all technical .   if you don't need the latest greatest (s6, s6 edge, note4) this thing is a powerhouse unto itself. i am very happy with my decision and for the price ($20 with 2yr contract) how could i not be .   bought three of these for different members of my family, they are all in love, fantastic, beautiful phones .   great phone. the fact that it was only 20 bucks makes it even better .   love the phone! two days after ordered, it was delivered i was able to activate it! as described, shipping time as shown. love the size. i can carry it in a bag so pockets are not an issue. threw an otter box on it for extra girth. the best part is the special stylus hidden in the phone .   great phone. i was considering to by the sony phone, but i needed something cheaper. i am very satisfied with it. very easy to use and i use many-many functions on it. the battery life is great too, unless i acidentally leave on the wifi or use the gps. these deplete my battery much faster. the only problem with this phone that it is impossible to change contacts, email or texting background dark or black. that's a little disturbing but if you can get over this it is a great device .   as described. works great .   first class phone, does everything i want and more. it protects my phone and i have received lots of compliments on the design i chose .   great phone fast delivery highly recommend. bought for my wife. nice display. what spoils the experience is verizon wont live up to a promise made to me the same day. waiving $80.00 in activation fees. csr i spoke with never noted the account and they will not look at the call .   i love this phone! easy to use and has great features. best phone purchase i've ever made .   best price for a phone with a new contract anywhere! this is my second time going through amazon wireless and though i had to be persistent with the carrier on bringing over old numbers to new account with the same carrier i was able to get it done, billing is correct and we are very happy. nice upgrade from the note 2 .   just got it today and love it .   as good as new. happens to say "verizon" on top right, which is lulzy on my sprint device .   the phone is large enough to see and it fits in my pocket or in a purse pocket. i like all the features. it takes wonderful pictures. i love the visiual voice mail. i took it on a bus trip to savannah ga and 5 peopel wanted one like it. i sent them a copy of the ad in amazon. i am still amazed that i was able to purchase the phones at that price. the stylus pen is great and if you start to walk away it beeps. how cool is that .   product was as described .   great phone great price does everything the note 2 does but better .   awesome product .  just like new. l love my phone. good price and the wife loves it .   good phone. i purchased the verizon galaxy note three i love the condition of the phone but the only thing i hate about it is that it keeps losing service in certain places at my home you gotta be in a certain spot to pick up service and that's just crazy. i chose note3 cuz note4 doesnt have usb3.0 cuz the pen and usb3.0 are the most thing that i care i think that it is pretty good deal but sometime i feel this phone is not really optimized well cuz i have lag and freezing frequently so at the end i returned all but for the price, it is a good deal. great phone .   love it. the phone is in perfect working order. its a great addition. we had an issue with the charger in the beginning which was resolved rather quickly. i would definitely buy from cellular trend again .   we bought 2 used note3 & neither one had any problems, flaws or scratches. they work great & the price was great! the company promptly got them to us within 3 days. i would recommend this product and company to anyone .   great phone .  defiently worth getting. i've had the phone for a couple of days now and i can't put it down. i was a bit worried about buying something like a phone online but so far this phone is amazing i just ordered a case for it. super awesome .   i luv my phone. it the best investment .   have to continuously take battery and sims card out to change from landscape mode on internet and photos sucks for a new phone. great phone, perfect size. easy to switch from iphone 4 to samsung and android even with some adjustment time. i'm always pleased to finally have a phone that's easy to read and often takes place of a tablet .   still have it today and love it over my previous iphones .   first off, i bought this phone used from cellular trendz. there was an issue with the camera, but they were great and worked with me to get the part to fix the issue before a big event came up. i was replacing an lg g2 that i had, after many drops, finally killed and had no insurance on. i liked the g2, but i have to say, i love the note 3. if i could have afforded the note 4, i would have gone with that, but for my needs and budget, you really can't beat the note 3. i love the size, which is so much easier on my eyes. i draw, so i do find the s pen really useful for doodling on the phone. i don't do any heavy gaming, so i've had no issues with lagging or memory. it does have bloatware that samsung should really let you delete, but other than that, this phone knocks it out of the park, especially for a phone that isn't on the bleeding edge any more. looking back, i really wish i'd originally gone with this phone instead of the g2 .   a1. best phone i ever had .   the software update always failed hence it refused to function properly .   i absolutely love my new phone it looked brand new. love this phone. even if it's a little over a year old, it's still such an improvement over my note 2. the only problem i have with it is that sometimes after getting a push notification, the screen doesn't time out. i'm sure this can be fixed through the settings, but i haven't been able to figure out how yet .   so far i have had this note 3 for about a month. i use it with straight talk service. phone is like brand new. everything works great .   great phone. it's an alright, solid phone. the pen is a great feature for drawing and editing photos. though i honestly dont use it all that much. its a little wide making it hard to put in a pocket or do one handed. this phone is however only slightly bigger than an s5. it has a good processor and is easy to use. the call quality however is crap. it sounds like your underwater. the camera is also poor and i have difficulty getting a sharp image .   love my new note 3! great features .  one being that i can actually see it! i was worried about moving away from my old smart phone with a slide out keyboard as i'm part of the .  ahem .  more mature crowd and my eyes & fingers aren't what they used to be. no problems whatsoever .  i text like a pro on this .   this phone is awesome, never thought i would switch from my iphone but this phone has changed my mind. it works great on the pageplus service, i have no complaints .   rooted it, got rid of the bloatware, and this phone rocks! should last for a long while .   who needs a note 4 and 5 when the original is the bomb diggity .   i love this phone and its s pen. it is user friendly, the screen is big and clear. its functionality is unparalleled. i love this phone, i cant imagine what it is missing or what has been upgraded in the newer models. very satisfied with this purchase .   phone arrived on time and phone features work well, however the camera on this phone is horrible. worst yet is that no matter if you set your flash to on it does not flash .   no flash=worst camera ever! realized maybe my phone flash is broken, went to return for a working one and it says i cannot return past march 6, 2015. it's march 14th. i am very very unhappy and dissatisfied because i bought this phone because everyone raved about the camera. i used the camera quite a bit for my business so it is important to me. i'm sorry that i didn't realize sooner that the poor focus and shaky pictures were due in part to the flash completely not working. clearly this phone was not fully tested before they sent it to me :( i will never buy electronics from amazon again .   this was a used phone but looked brand new everything is perfect defiantly worth the money .   best phone ever .   i love samsung. i have owned all the galaxy tabs for years so of course i had to try the note3. love it. only wish i could have afforded the note4 at the time .   phone was in excellent cosmetic condition but .   it shuts off and freezes alot! i have to remove case then take back off 2 remove battery each time. it is a pain:-(. this is a great phone .  i wished i would have ordered two of them. i have the galaxy s5 and love it, but am a little jealous of that my hubby has this one. it is going to take a bit to learn to use all the tools it has but so far he has no complainants and so neither do i .   not what i hoped for. samsung and verizon did their best to cripple the features of android phones that attracted me after palm os went away. lunacy to block me from using my device as i want to. hate to have to research ways to get around restrictions that shouldn't exist .   so far, so good. enjoying the update from my old phone, larger screen, added apps. good choice, i think .   love it .   update .   last week (april 28, 2015) verizon pushed the android 5.0 lollipop update for the note 3. do not install the update .   there have been multiple problems with the update. my particular problem has been if the phone is in a no coverage area for a length of time, when you get back into a coverage area it will not pick the signal back up until you reboot the phone. i am now waiting on my 3rd phone from verizon to deal with this and their only remedy at this point is not to install the update. look online before you consider updating and read all the issues with this update. original review .   i transitioned from a motorola droid razr maxx to this samsung galaxy note 3. a difference between night and day. i have literally moved from the worst phone i have ever owned to the absolute best phone i have ever owned. pros: quad core replaceable / up-gradable battery beautiful display s-pen call quality available accessories app compatibility cons: i'll let you know if i find one. love it .   great phone unlimited capabilities specially when you expand it with the usb otg that allows you to be able to do so much more. when i attach the usb otg, i can expand my memory by using a regular usb thumb drive .   kudos to samsung .   great product and fast shipping .   phones works but some of the sensors do not work on the front and the phone lags .   excellent phone, excellent service  .   works as advertized, provides very good protection .   love it .   very good . it's like new .   excellent product with amazing quality. worked right out of the package .   ok till someone stole it out of my handbag at a party now i have to deal with verizon to cxl the service. i was completely satisfied. fantastic, never had a smartphone before, and it's nice to know that it is user friendly. very much fun, and going to have a heck of a time figuring all the cool things out. i especially love the stylus since i hate using my fingers to work on a screen. i always feel like my fingers are going to smudge up the screen, so the stylus really helps me out with that. not tried any of the apps yet, but i'm probably going to be doing a lot of exploring on it, as i said. excellent phone, and tons of fun. even my husband, who is through tracfone, was considering on getting one through his provider. all my phones have been samsungs, from the first phone which i cannot remember the name of, to my samsung intensity ii, and now my samsung galaxy note 3. i love it .   i love it .   i love my galaxy note 3! the screen image is amazing .   this is a great device. i replaced a samsung galaxy s3 with this phone and have no regrets. as a prolific tablet pc pen user, having a pen for my phone takes me back to my palm days. this has eliminated all of the little post it notes and information scribbled on the back of business cards that littered my desk and car. my only issue is the lack of standard non-bulky cases for this phone .   best phone i have ever had .   lovin' it. exactly what i wanted. i just love it .  that's all i can say .  i just love it  .  and the size is wonderful .   super note .   awesome phone/tablet for those of us with older eyes. the multitasking / multi screen feature is a plus .   great phone. fast shipping. can't download music with it for some reason not happy about that. great item and easy to adjust to .   keeps getting better and better .   great phablet. the stylus is a pleasure to use and the battery life lasts a good while even with heavy use. love taking notes with the s note app that was pre-installed. overall i would recommend the note 3 to others .   i love this phone .   great phone at a great price. it actually plays more video formats than the note 4 .   purchased this smart phone for the wife. she absolutely loves it. she says that the screen is very clear, it takes awesome pictures, and it's easy to see. she has a problem with the vision in her right eye, but because of the large display she can easily see the text and pictures .   a fan of the motorola droids i was little leery to make a change. i first tried the newer galaxy s5. it was pretty much all plastic and felt cheap, so i decided to try the note. i did a lot of research and the note 4 for the price wasn't really worth the $299 especially with the note 3 at $99 for almost the same specs (now only $1). beautiful display extremely responsive intuitive metal bezel feels sturdy, gives a little heft, but the phone is in no way heavy even better with go launcher i've barely used my tablet, because the screen is so clear and just big enough to do anything i want. many more features made me fall in love with the note 3 .   i bought this phone used because verizon was being ridiculous. i love it. it was listed as used. it only had like one tiny dent, it looks basically new. the phone works well, it was cleared off all i had to do was insert my sd card. it came with a battery and a charger. it is quite good for the price, hundreds less than new from verizon but works amazing! i've had it well over a month and no problems yet. it also came with the s-pen for the phone .   love it. wish i could have gotten the note 4 but this is good for now .   this phone is fabulous! i had an iphone 4, and really didn't need anything fancy or better but got tired of the updates and being it was a 4, it was too old for many newer things. i wanted something that i could read books on that is large enough like a kindle, but use as a phone as well. this phone is it for me. phablet .  yeah ok. i call it awesome! perfect in size to read books, not too big that it still is ok to use as phone while holding it up to your ear. it is bigger than most phones, but with all the features as hands-free, gestures and so many features i am still learning about, i recommend this to anyone wanting the cross between a tablet and a cell phone. many others give great detail to the phone, i am simply going to say its fast, battery lasts longs (if you remember to close applications you're not using) so many smart features, and way better than iphone 4. i love android and all the same apps pretty much as itunes has plus google play store, kindle app for books .  its endless .   love it .   really nice size phone if you like them this big. everything is working nicely so far. i had my phone activated at verizon, who also transferred all of my data to the new phone. so far, so good .   i am satisfied with new phone, only thing, just a month after i got this phone, samsung came out with galaxy 4 note. so in just 30 days , i am already behind in tech .   received a previously opened product. there was dust on the phone (underneath the packaging, which scratched the screen) and the earbuds were missing. battery life seemed poor, but that might have been because it had been used and repackaged. i had a lengthier review, but the powers that be didn't want you to see it .   i went from and iphone 5s to this huge galaxy note 3. the screen is so easy to see. battery life is awesome. my only complaint is the way it starts acting funny when the battery gets down to about 20% (which doesn't happen much). it doesn't respond as good if the battery gets to that low .   great phone. great phone .   this is definitely the best phone i've owned. my previous were the samsung fascinate (galaxy 1) and then the galaxy s3. i have always prefered samsung devices. i like apples hardware but i hate ios, so i stick to android devices. after working several jobs selling cell phones, and working with them all the time i always choose to buy samsung. i just think the galaxy series phones have been really good. well, the time came for my s3 to upgrade and i was planning on getting the newest "s" phone which at the time was the s5. after playing around with one for a bit i just wasn't crazy about it. it seemed bigger than my s3 by a noticeable amount, and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off. i didn't care about the s health or anything like that. i care about speed, and features. thats where the note shines. it is a large phone, but its actually not that much bigger than an s5. an s5 with an otterbox is bigger than my note with a slim grip case. i have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all. also the note has awesome features. s-window is really cool, as well as scrapbooker. s-note is useful for reminders or jotting down a number or something really quick. s-draw is really cool to use. the pen even comes in handy for texting and normal web use. its screen is also really nice not quite 1080p but its 720p. it looks just fine i watch videos on it all the time. all in all i highly recommend the note 3. the note 4 hardware and build quality/materials are better. its more expensive and has some slightly annoying features though. consider a note as your next phone over a galaxy s. not to m. this one wasn't working properly, so i had to ask for a replacedment. just got this phone a month or so back and i really like it. i had a note 2, so it is not that much different, but a step up. :). extremely easy to navigate through the features. multi-tasking is a breeze. decent upgrade from previous samsung tech .   love it .   ðÿ˜šðÿ˜š. we love our phones nice size screen and very high tech i am glad i chose the note 3 it's an amazing phone. this phone is so beautiful the rose gold makes it outstanding. my husband got me this phone as a surprise and i was stunned when i opened up the box. i've been getting a lot of compliments from people, all credits to my husband thanks honey bun for making me feel special in your heart .   i love this phone. however, the sim card i received didn't work, so i had to go to verizon store to get a new sim card .   great phone, fast shipping. wanted to grab another note 3 (i already have one) before they are gone .   great. love it .   love my note 3 .  the only problem i'm having is i cannot seem to sign on to my home network .  no clue what the problem is .   my wife loves this phone, it is amazing. awesome phone very satisified .   great phone. awesome phone. wow .   what a phone .   i had long ago decided to replace my aging droid bionic with a samsung galaxy s4, but a phone guru friend recommended that i consider the note 3 instead of a galaxy s4 as a replacement for my old, tired and broken droid bionic. after reading several reviews comparing the note 3 with the galaxy s4, and speaking with a local cell phone expert, i decided to spend $385 on a note 3 instead of $250 for a galaxy s4. when i placed the amazon order for the note 3, i wondered if $385, versus $250 for a galaxy s4, was well spent. well, after spending several hours learning how to use my "loaded with features note 3", i am happy that i spent the additional $135. compared to my bionic (not a fair comparison i know) the note 3 is screaming fast, and has lots of features that i hope to master in a month or two. if a potential user checks-out any of the dozen or so youtube videos re the outstanding features of the note 3 (snapdragon quad 800, great gpu, 3mb ram, stylus and on and on) and you might consider the note 3 (or note 4 if price is no consequence) as your next smart phone. i found several reviews comparing the note 3 to the note 4 that recommend the user stay with their note 3 unless upgrading to a note 4 is virtually free. one reviewer indicated that by late 2015 a successor to the note 4 will be available with many improvements (though i can't imagine what can be done to improve the note platform). my note 3 is another samsung gem .   excellent phone. love the features .   and the price .   i liked it, but it gets laggy and bogged down with heavy use. nice sized screen. needs special charging cords (usb3.0) i switched back to the iphone 6 plus. to me a higher quality product better build too .   love, love, love it .   this is my first smartphone and i love it. the first three days i was like .   this thing is way to big, this isn't going to work. after that i got used to it and i can tell you, there is no way i can ever go back. the camera is fantastic. the picture quality on the screen is breathtaking. i have watched so many hd videos. it does allow for split screen and doing multiwork. for example i can split screen and have txt messages on one side and web browser on the other. i can also get on the internet and search something while talking on the phone with someone. and don't forget the stylus! i had some people tell me it was gimmicky but i really like it. when making notes and reminders its much easier than typing and i like to use it for alot of games as well since it is more precise than using my finger .   perfect. great product and great seller .   you have my vote .   after taking the time to learn allot of the features, i wish i've gotten it earlier. it's a mobile office, entertainment center, library etc .   this goes with me everywhere. i love the android os and will not in the foreseeable future switch back to ios .   love the big screen .   great phone .  i love the bigger size .   great sound .  a great buy .   fan of the note phones from the beginning .   best phone i've ever had. 'nuff said .   pros: fast, boat load of features, sturdy cons: spam! google will shove about 10 apps down your throat, samsung another 6 as well as verizon (not actual #'s estimated). low speaker volume dual window mode only works with a small amount of apps .   very user friendly and offers many new features .   i love it .   love it so easy to use and excellent camera quality. phone in amazing condition. very happy .   for being a re-furbished phone, this was great. this posting review is quite late, but even now as i still have the phone it works great with no issues at all .   i love this phone! i can finally see what is taking place on the screen. battery lasts at least 12 hours depending how much use you give the phone of course. very user friendly and stylish .   very pleased with my samsung galaxy note 3. good product prompt delivery. battey life is pretty good. i charge it every 2 days. nice sharp screen. love the s-pen .   love the screen size. got the uag case for it which fit nice and snug. came packaged with sim card and activation didn't take too long. so far i've had it for a few months and it's beautiful .   love this phone .   love it. excellent phone to match with my samsung tv,the screen is the best that iv seen out there,this phone is big,fat and long and my wife loves it and its true the bigger the better .   love this phone:). exceeded expectations in every way .   great phone with all capabilities of a smart phone and small note book .   screen keeps going black when talking or texting. the note 3 is a great rendition of the android operating system; it's only shortcomings are really from the os, not the hardware.physically, it doesn't feel as big as its size, compared to other phones on the market, and samsung has added some of their own tweaks to make the size even less of an issue - my biggest complaint is that too many of the apps, and the interface itself, simply make everything bigger on the big screen, rather than taking advantage of the size to include more usable content  .   there's no reason why a screen this size still only has 4 columns of app icons! but there are other front-ends available that remedy that situation, making the note 3 an even better tool. the phone works well, but its interface is just about the worst i've seen; again, it's an os issue, and android needs to 'borrow' some ideas from hp's excellent-but-defunct webos. connectivity has been excellent, both 4g and wi-fi; the 13mp camera is outstanding, the s-pen makes editing, sketching and note-taking a breeze .   i love amazon.com. when i got this phone i loved it! it was awesome, big, fast, lasted all day, great camera, great reception! then they "upgraded" my operating system to kitkat and that all changed! ok, it's still big .   kitkat turned my phone into a brick! i did not move, but i could no longer make or receive calls at home! just got a "network not available" message or something like that. my data signal was likewise in the toilet. battery went to the potty, and the worst was the formerly awesome camera became practically useless because now when you tapped the shutter button, you had to wait about 3 seconds (no exaggeration) for the picture to take. if you moved, the picture was trash. this all started immediately following the kitkat update - google the problems, they're myriad. i wouldn't buy another one till the next software update comes out. total brick, and total waste of my money. thanks for nothing verizon, or samsung, or whoever's fault this is - because no matter who you call it's always the "other's one" fault .   best smartphone yet. love the larger size and pen feature. very fast operating system and longest battery life i've had .   bigger is better. got in this instead of the 4 due to the price. only gripe is i'm not confident the silver around the phone will last. still awesome .   best phone i've had yet. i love it. i was really excited to get this phone - my old one was really doggin it. my husband had gotten one earlier and really likes his. after having it for about a month, one day red started showing on the screen and then got really bad. verizon said that it was cracked. it was never dropped or mistreated. he replaced it and we thought it was just an unusual occurrance. well, the second day after i bought mine i was squeezing the sides as i pushed the buttons to raise the volume and suddenly noticed that it had cracks across the screen. then the screen went black. i hadn't even had the thing three whole days. i started reading of other people having problems with the screen cracking and having to replace this screen multiple times. so i immediately returned this and will not be getting this model .   i love this phone. i switched to it from an iphone 4. i really like the big screen and all of the cool features it has that i'm still figuring out. and it was such a good deal, $100 less than the verizon website .   complicated and not at all intuitive compared to apple products. i don't likeit, but it does what i need it to do .  i wouldn't buy it again .   awesome deal thru and thru .   was very easy to switch from my old phone .   great phone. and buying through amazon was a breeze. i saved money ofer what i would have paid in verizon's store .   absolutely love my phone. this puts any phone i have owned or used to shame. i will be upgrading to the note 4 instead of the iphone 6 plus due to how much i loved my current phone. display is the perfect size .   todate, my favorit phone ever. yes it is a bit larger at 5.7 inches. it is fast and fun! the galaxy note phones are excellent for anyone wanting to use less paper. i use mine note 3 to take notes and make todo lists, annotate pictures or pdfs. i just love it .   why was no sim card included .   am enjoying my upgrade from a razr maxx. wanted/needed a bigger screen. this fits the bill. i did find that the bare phone was very slippery - was always afraid it would slip from my hand. a simple case (from amazon) took care of that 'problem' nicely .   very pleased with phone the color and quality of is better the expected .  great phone would recommend it to anyone. it's a really great phone, but if you live in california watch out: you gonna have to pay the tax for the *full price* of the phone, not for the price you pay for amazon wireless. so the tax came out to ~$60 beginning of this year. thank you california, that absolutely unreasonable .   love this phone, it is absolutely great. the stylus is a godsend for writing quick notes, and has a bad ass battery life. works for 2 plus days and i drive through a buncha low signal areas. the screen size is awesome, and gives me tons of room to view emails and websites, i can even run two side by side and read them easily. the size is not an issue as i'm a pretty big guy with big hands, but even my girlfriend (5'4") has one and loves her screen too. she uses her stylus to type instead of her fingers mostly. highly recommend this phone .   one of my best buys. i am a person who does not run to purchase a new trendy item. i had held on to my old cell phone for many years and this year i decided to purchase a smartphone that could replace several gadgets (palm, mp3 player, ereader, etc .  ) this smartphone does that and more. i also like the size of this phone, it is large enough to enjoy without being too big or too little .   excellent phone .  takes a couple of weeks to get used to because of size .  after that get ready to be wowed .  love especially the included pen/stylus .  if you're a former palm freak like me you're in heaven (again) .  sooo much better than an iphone .  priced very reasonable .  excellent delivery and easy setup and sync for your old phone .   there appears to be a software glitch where the camera phone flash comes on and stays on. i have to restart the phone. however some apps can take over the function of the phone maybe this is occurring .   i love this phone my wife can attest to me being hard to be satisfied with phone. for the 1st week i said everyday "did i tell you i love this phone today?" my only word of advice is to be home when it is delivered and be the one to open it so your 20 year old son doesn't open it while being helpful and break your stylus before you get home. in his defence he immediately ordered a new one for me .   love my new phone. purchased using my verizon upgrade and it was $100 cheaper than what verizon was asking .   the samsung galaxy note 3 is a powerful personal pocket computer that you can also use as a phone as well. i bought this phone a year late and it is still miles beyond most of the phones out there. it's fast, smooth and the battery life is fantastic. if your a doodler like me the s-pen in combination with sketchbook for galaxy is top class when it comes to digital art applications. i would recommend downloading the google now launcher as opposed to using the standard tocuhwiz that the phone comes with as it is a little clunky and if you have a google account that you use frequently the launcher really makes the experience personalized and it's scary accurate. the only downside to this phone is speaker quality without headphones .   i bought note 3 for its capability to hand write, multi windows, and bigger screen. then, the resolution of the bigger screen is not the best, multi window operation is very cumbersome, especially when you want to type something, and for the hand writing capability, hand writing recognition is poor, making hand writing very slow, and the screen is not sensitive to the stylus. there are areas that barely could record the stylus strokes. the only thing that impresses me is its battery, fast charging and long lasting. remember, this is well before (one year ahead of) iphone6 and iphone6 plus .   the note series may be a little big, but they are the best smart phones i have owned so far .   the best cell phone i've ever bought. easy use bright brilliant display, pictures come out beautiful. easy to communicate between all my devices. the iphone 6 has nothing on the samsung note 3 or 4. best. phone. ever .   great phone. have had it over a month now and am extremely pleased with the note 3. i had the samsung galaxy s iii and was 2 yrs old. was time to upgrade. the samsung galaxy note 3 has a solid reputation and rather than wait for the note 4 with no track record i opted for the note 3. glad i did. only one caveat i have found is do not buy a protective case that has a magnetic closure tab because that can interfere with the note hand writing function. have had no issues getting used to thise phablet sized phone. in fact i find i'm preferring it because the screen is larger, makes texting much easier. camera is surprisingly good for indoor photos but finding it's not as great for brightly lit scenes such as taking shots of landscapes using auto. better off using the manual settings for that .   this is an excellent phone. i could sit here and go through all the specs on the phone highlighting how it excels in almost every single one of them but i'm not going to do that. i will tell you the phone is by far and away my tops of all time owning them. i know the note 4 just dropped as well as google's new nexus, but if you are looking for a better value price wise this is an excellent option .   i so love this phone. i really like this phone! due to it's size the text is a little larger & easier to read. much faster than my samsung s3. much improved camera with more functions .   great smart phone. light weight, stylish and modern .   phone arrived in time, instructions to activate was very simple. love my note 3. sometimes have had issues with phone call quality, but otherwise the phone is great buy .  love samsung products. finally something that has my heart this is the best phone i have ever owned. i carry two and the other is an iphone. but hands down this phone does everything and i would never go back to any other kind. it is big enough for viewing and i love the touch enlarging. battery lasts all day even with steady use. i love the way it can be customized to fit your needs. tons of emails every day make this note 3 my best choice for a phone no matter what the needs you have .   excellent device, great process of delivery .   great. awesome phone. very happy with it .   my husband is very happy with this cellphone. the phone is super great, meets all specifications. my husband recommends it. what my husband does not like are the two year contract .   best phone. things you should know. 1. best battery life than any other android phone i have had. 2. most features that are exclusive for this phone i thought i would use. i do not. for example i do not use the stylus as much as i did. the recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text. so i do not use it anymore. 3. fast response. have had this phone for about 9 months. still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one. 4. can only be used with a max mini sd card of 64gb. this is a minor complaint only. 5. does not get hot. unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch. the normal running temp is about 100 degrees fahrenheit but you can not feel it. 6. charges fast from dead to full charge. this is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2.1 amps. i also use a 3.5 amp car charger which it charges faster with. 7. the ir ability i use a lot for controlling my tv and dvr. the app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault. 8. wifi is fast. my internet speed tops at 40mb/s and the phone wifi can do it. unlike most phones wifi usually cap at 20mb/s no matter what. 9. i have the verizon 4g lte and the lte i have seen push 60mb/s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive. a bunch of other things positive and negative. i am disappointed in samsung and their lack more rather restrictions of app abilities but this is not the phone fault. great phone and best i have had .   i was really worried about how big this phone was. i was coming from a google nexus 4. the note3 is awesome. the big screen makes things really easy to read and makes the multitasking/multiwindow feature really easy to use. the stylus is accurate and the preinstalled sketchpad app by autodesk is pretty awesome! it stays in my pocket well enough because it is so big. i never worry about it falling out. still getting a case though. graphics, processing power, storage all more enough. plus, it accepts sd cards. wonderful phone, can't see wanting to get rid of this one any time soon .   best phone on the planet hands down  .   fulfilled expectations .   this would be a good phone if the charging cables worked, i'm on my second charger and this one is requesting that i use my original charger. which doesn't work any more. i'm replacing the phone. who needs a phone if it wont charge. its a paper weight at this point. don't waste your money .   this phone is defective. i can not receive calls, make calls, i can not send text messages. it freezes up & i can not open any page. i receive calls & then it hangs up. i call the person back & they all say they never called me. while typing it freezes up & won't move, then it types 4-5 of the same letters. many more issues .   purchased this for my mom since she loves the giant screen and has a hard time reading small font. however, imo, between the screen and battery life, that's all i like about this phone. i hate samsung's bloatware, joke of a ui, and their build construction. coming from several years of using apple products and now the new htc one m8, the samsung phones feel like children toys. to be fair, there are some intuitive features about the note 3 (use of stylus) but i just can't stand how much bloatware is on this thing. if it were my phone, i would have returned it already. but since i've had to help teach my mom how to use this thing, well, maybe the ui is better off for someone like her. the smartphone is fully functional in it's condition, but if you are like me and want a pure android feel, stay clear from this phone .   i absolutely love this phone, with it's giant screen and easy to read menus, and countless options for customizing apps and appearance. when i look at smaller phones now i just shake my head & laugh :). love this phone .  brought it to verizon store and am now up on verizon pre-paid .  no issues .   great. if you dont think you will use the stylus, buy the cheaper model. fantastic .   i love it! i thought it was going to be too big to handle but it turns out that immediately, i wonder how i worked with my small droid rzar. i needed this phone and it's capabilities when i outgrew my rzar. i don't know yet all it does but i'm enjoying the learning process .   i upgraded to the note 3 from the note ii. i love it! nice big display, awesome camera, and great verizon service .   i love this phone lot better than iphone. best phone available, until the note 4 comes out .   got my phone fast and works and looks great. very happy with the phone, unfortunately i didn't read the small print and it doesn't have a charger so have to go out and purchase one .   love this phone, can't complain. if you treat it right and turn off power-hungry settings and it won't die on you. pen is magical. i take work notes on it, personal notes, grocery lists, and the screen is to die for. if you're on the fence, it's even slim (if you don't use a protector). excellent phone, especially for people with vision problems. everything about this phone is great .   amazing phone, just 2 things. when i received the phone the battery was running out of power way too fast and also the charger did not work properly. in addition to purchasing the note 3 i had to buy a new battery and a new charger and that's why i gave this 4 stars. if these 2 things worked when i received it then i would've easily gave this 5 stars. other than that the note 3 is an amazing phone .   great price .  got the run around with verizon on price. amazon beat their price and availability. it was even shipped to my house on a sunday morning. i am very pleased .   great phone, i upgraded from the note 2 .   rooted the puppy, removed all the crapware, and man, what a beast this thing is. i rolled back google maps because the stock version is abysmal, but, again, what a beast. no, voice service isn't great but .   who the hell wants to talk on the phone these days .   this thing got cheap as hell with the note 4 coming out .   for the price, you can't beat this. yes, samsung's service is embarrassingly bad, but take care of your phone and you won't need it .   awesome phone. fast, easy to read, nice reception everywhere. low volume .   great device. my wife loved this as a gift. item was delivered on time and is as expected. best phone i've had. also, very impressed with the amazon activation process .   this phone is amazing .   love this phone. long battery life even on battery hog games .   everything is just amazing. the camera is killer. the battery is killer. and the superamoled screen is simply amazing. blows away all other phones. you don't know how good it is until you get it .   this is my best phone ever. i have owned a lot of androids and this one is by far my favorite. no problems with apps crashing or conflicting. the battery life is amazing and lasts all day even if i play music and games. i never really use the stylus but that's just me. plus, the deal i got on this through amazon was the best one out there. i thought the price was a typo at first .   a phone this expensive and no flash player minus 1 star. i went from an old flip phone to this and although i still don't know everything it does (need to take a class!) i just love it. really love the "note" taking capacity with the stylus - and being able to draw a diagram on occasion is really a plus .   and then print to my printer via bluetooth! so much fun, but it's made me a lot more efficient. and the size - it's like having large print everything! perfect for people who can never find their readers .   so far it's the best phone i have had, it's a bit big but i like that .   it is large .   i brought one for my brother for christmas and it was so well liked by him when my husband's phone broke i brought him this phone to replace his and then my daughter wanted one. these phones are a tablet and phone wrapped up in one. they are useful and functional and work well to house everything from important documents to games and music .   this is a great phone. the battery lasts very long even though i keep using it for the whole day. nice features and sharp bright image quality .   as expected .   so far so good. bought this to replace the samsung note ii when upgrade eligibility came around. note 2 screen cracks easily and i suspects that this "gorilla" glass will break easily too. just make sure you have a protective case just in case you drop it. functionality is great. battery life is exceptional compare to note 2 and droid razor. pictures are exquisite compare to the iphone according to several i phone owners that saw my pictures .   i have been using this phone for about 4 months. my biggest complaint is the battery life. everyday at a normal use (2-3 calls, 1-2 hour web or stock watch, the rest is standby), the battery drains out and shut down by itself at night. i need to charge it as soon as i am home. the rest of the features are fine .   love .   great phone upgraded from my note 2! i like that the stylist securely fits the opening more easily than the 2 .   awesome. i decided to wait utnil i reviewed this phone. we ordered four of these for our family and we have had them for five months now. one of the phone had to be replaced after we got it because it would not hold a charge, so we got a replacement for that one. now after five months all four phones are having charging problems. my wife's phone will not charge anymore, no matter what cord we use. all other phones you have to jiggle the cord and have it placed in certain way to charge and then it takes way too long to charge. this is an obvious manufacture defect. one phone i can understand, but four phones or actually five if you count the one that was replaced. that is unnaceptable and poor quality control and design on samsung's part. this will be the last samsung phone we buy. it's unfortunate as the phone has great features but it does no good if you can't charge the phones properly. so beware, you could have battery, charging problems after a few months .   best phone ever .   i'm never buying a phone off of amazon again. they said i couldn't buy a second phone afterwards to add to the account. that aside this phone is great. only thing i'm not fond of is the outside bezel, the chrome chips quite easily. also if you need to replace the screen, it requires pretty much the entire assembly to be replaced .   as expected .   if i could give this 6 stars, i would .   excellent process .  and the phone is fantastic .   love, love, love this phone. what doesn't it do .   seriously, buy it .   quit trying to decide and just buy it .   coming from samsung galaxy s3, this was a decent jump. fits perfect in my hands -- i have been using this phone for several weeks now, it is probably the best smartphone in my opinion as of writing this review. i do dislike the crap-ware built in by verizon, cannot get rid if it unless one roots the phone. battery lasts at least 2 days on moderate use .   4 stars because phone came in wrong color. i didn't feel like replacing it. best phone i have owned to date, hands down .   love my phone. i use it for real estate. easy to see and my kids refer to it as the brick, because it is so big. they have no clue what we had in the 80's. :). i am so happy with this phone. upgraded from a razr for the larger screen. i have to say, i am impressed with amazon - they sent a separate email with activation instructions / phone # which took maybe 2 minutes, immediate activation ! i am amazed with the capabilities of this phone - the clarity of the screen is fantastic. i live in a rural area and the reception is the same as my old phone. i inserted my previous sd card and i am able to access everything. it shipped with the 4.3 android os. love it ! thanks amazon  .   i bought this phone in december 2013. l still love it. the drawback is its size. l hare small hands and it can be difficult to grasp because it is big.it is also heavier than my previous phones. the size is why i bought it though - l wanted the big screen and it is worth it. lt is very durable. i did put a case on it but it is a lightweight one that only covers the edges and back. i have dropped my phone many times with no damage. samsung does have a lot of useless programs that come pre-installed but i haven't had issues with those. my battery easily lasts all day most days. if the battery seems to be draining quickly, clearing the cache and restarting the phone seems to solve the problem. the on-screen keyboard is easier to use on the bigger screen. the split windows are now useable. games are easier to play. everything is easier to read. one more drawback is that the volume buttons and power button are directly opposite of each other. i often end up pressing both at the same time. the rest of the phone isn't much different from the galaxy nexus. the programs are the same. the screens look the same only bigger .   best phone/computer ever .   this is by far the best phone on the planet. i replaced my samsung galaxy nexus with this phone. the improvements are so vast it would take me all day to explain them. and since i don't get paid for my reviews, i'll just say this. if you want a really good smart phone, with a screen just slightly smaller than a tablet, that can do just about anything you can imagine, then this would be the phone for you .   but get it from amazon .   you'll get a better deal .  verizon wanted the same money for only the 16 gig version. . also as a side note, samsung makes a smart watch that goes with this bad boy. totally incredible technology .   could be a little more ergonomic with respect to the placement of the buttons, but otherwise an outstanding smartphone. it functions exactly as i hoped it would and i would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a quality large screen smartphone .   best phone i've ever owned so far. i wish verizon would allow bootloader unlock .   this phone is the best .   it was so easy to set up. easy to use, long battery life time, has so many awesome features .   the screen quality is second to none. this is the best phone i have ever used. the bigger screen allows you to do business like you are at a computer. i just ordered 2 more for family members from amazon. amazon is the best place to purchase these phones as well .   i researched the crap out of this phone. pros -big battery, good life -its a samsung phone(usually quick to update and support a device 2 years out) -32gb storage -the pen is great for a taking quick notes cons -my hands cover the speaker often, maybe that's just how i hold it -above average amounts of bloatware. other -don't care about the fake leather backing, i have a case on it. -thought i would use the pen for a week and never again. wrong! use it daily for on the go notes. much easier than evernote .   probably the most powerful, capable phones of all on the market. especially good is that you can open more than one app at a time, and that it links to accessories like watches. battery life is long and the display large and bright. i, and others i know, have replaced tablets with the note 3. it is a real workhorse .   best phone i've ever had! truly stable. i've been late catching up on phones but compatibility is important to me via windows and this phone has it. simply impressed and i do recommend .   i love this phone's features but i've had to replace it twice in 6 months, first it wouldn't charge, now it's booting down and restarting itself and verizon only wants to replace with a "like new" or refurbished phone .   it's going to be a while before i learn how to use everything this phone can do but it's still quite useable without any training at all. it's just that it can do a whole lot more. i love the size of it. getting on the internet isn't an exercise in frustration with this phone. you can actually read your emails and browse the web without eye strain. this phone will definitely take me through at least the next 2 years of my contract .   this is more a review of the color combo for this device because that is the distinguishing feature in my opinion. my dad said he wanted the rose gold model. at first i was reluctant to get him it, because it looks a bit tacky in the pictures. in person, it works quite well and makes the device look premium especially if you pair it with a nice case. overall, there are a ton of reviews on android and the form factor for this model. i found the overall experience consistent with what i've read online: sure it's a big form factor, but the giant screen is really easy to look at/work with. the pen works well, but is still a bit of a gimmicky feature .   i love my note 3! it does everything well. i have a new tab 3 and still prefer to use my phone for most tasks i could do on the tablet. many people say its too big, but i disagree. i plan to upgrade to the next model when its available .   i have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it. i love everything about it except the visual voicemail update that wont go away. i do not want visual voicemail and besides that, verizon wants to charge 2.99 a month for it .   i won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software/bloat ware. the problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications continually pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone. if you clear it, it comes back, and there is no way to turn it off either! this is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phoneâ¡â¦s rating. other than that, the phone is a real performer, takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket. the phone is big, but so are my hands and it could not fit them better. this is truly a â¡â§where have you been all my lifeâ¡â¨ moment having this phone. the larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too. this phone would be a perfect 10+ without the software/bloat ware thing. but hey, where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you donâ¡â¦t want or need? anyway, the battery life has been great for me. most times i can go 2 days without a charge. i do turn my phone off at night though and i donâ¡â¦t play games on it with the exception of bubble shootâº. i went from the droid razr maxx to this phone and i loved that phone, well i thought i did until i got this phone. i was hesitant going away from motorola equipment, as i have always had some sort of motorola device because they are made so well. really glad i made this switch .   good battery life. i can actually use it because there is enough screen real estate for me to see what i'm doing. sure, it's the readers digest version of smart phones, but it's much more handy than the rezound it replaced. i haven't found a use for the stylus or the note pad function yet, but i'm sure i will. one thing that i really like is that i can make phone calls with this phone. i came to hate the htc phone interface, but this one is easy to use .   i use this phone for work as a realtor. great gps and apps. i literately don't need my computer any longer on home showings. very quick response and takes great photos .   i have ever used .  i had the iphone 4s and have to say i did not think it was worth the price. this samsung galaxy note 3 however is worth every penny. i'm not a techno genius and you don't need to be with this phone. the calls are clear .  the display is vibrant and easy to see (love the larger screen) .  it was actually the camera that sold me on this phone .  but i am digging the s-pen and the other gadgets it has. while i will admit apple seems to have more apps this android has all the apps that i was using on my iphone. all in all i say it is the best phone even though the galaxy s5 has hit the market .   nothing compares to this phone. everything else is inferior. everything else is too small, or too slow. the note 3 is the finest device ever made, period. i can't imagine texting or browsing or watching on something smaller than this now that i've had it for a while. the camera takes great pics & video, very fast. i'm also quite happy with verizon so far. fast data downloads and much better call clarity & service in my area than other carriers i've tried .   still learning the phone but its cool-i just wish it was cheaper-it sure ha a lot of toys to play with. this phone does everything you could ever want in a phone. it is so fast. the sceen size and viewing quality is out of this world. it's like a computer in your pocket. the camera takes the greatest pictures. all i can say is wow .   when i bought work fine but 15 days stopped working you're going to waste your money the only good thing is that amazon helped me get my money back. a few tiny quirks that samsung coulda make a little better, but very small making my rating absolutely excellent in whole! really love the phone and the multiple of things that can be done with it .   more than i probly know of or will use. highly recommended to anyone thinking about purchasing .   big hd screen (5.7"), great cameras (front and back), fast cpu, pen thing (i use it quiet often) .   a very solid device indeed. recommend .   great screen resolution. takes excellent photos. most of all i love it because it is larger and i can read the screen without glasses .   the only downside is it won't fit in all pockets. so i bought an otterbox case so i can through it in my purse. i am sure it would fit in men's pant pockets .   once i got all of the account information to match up, the rest of the transaction was smooth. in fact, this is one of the best phones that i have ever used. light, fast, and stunningly beautiful. it makes my note 2 look atrocious .   got this for a christmas present for my wife ans she absolutely loves it. easy to set up. she really likes to be able to write hand written notes with the s pen .   very good .   no problems once so ever and cheaper than going into the store.i think i made the right decision thank you. what an incredible awesome piece of tech! super fast, love the screen size. there has been some teasing from my work pals about the size though. it does take a short while to get used to the size of this phone, but i wouldn't trade it for any other on the market today .   my first one crashed on its automatic attempt to update the software. amazon in their usual pleasant and expedited means, shipped a replacement and walked through some manual steps to ensure the new data contract matched he new phone. i love the stylus and the apps, the size, the features. this is my 2nd favorite device next to the 12 inch galaxy note tablet. when apple quit updating my perfectly operable 1st gen ipad, i ran into the arms of android. in the time i left android for favor of my ipad, they have come so far and surpass ios. sadly, i feel like ipad and iphones are mere toys in comparison. they are great gadgets but the galaxy note line lets someone have fun and get work done. i can multitask like a nut on this thing. it does all that i need a little device to do .   it pretty much exceeded all my expectations. i suggest getting the new glass like protective lens for it because like all phones it will scratch .   i bought the first couple of iphones when they first came out and use my wife's every now and then and i've also owned 4 or 5 different android devices and the note series is by far my favorite. i purchased a note 2 when it first came out and loved it so i decided to go with the note 3 and it is an even better version of an already great phone. i was debating between this, the s5, and the htc one m8 but i went with the note and took the "hit" in processing power for and extra gb of ram (which is amazing). i've already rooted and installed the hyper drive rom but even without the extras of a custom rom this phone has so many features that make it a fantastic productivity tool. the s pen alone is something that i use literally every day at work to take meeting notes. i work with meeting software that allows you to share your screen so i can do that while also taking nones on my note 3 without showing everyone what i'm writing down. then i sync with evernote and have all of my notes in the cloud, it's perfect. fantastic phone with a great price here on amazon, couldn't be happier .   sturdy. exact fit. good price. ribbed surface makes it stick in your hand. good buy. recommend to protect an expensive device .   so many things i love about this. size is definitely important no matter what your wife tells you! lol. other than the size, it has lots of very cool and useful things. most of which i may never use. but for example, you can scroll thru things you are reading by simply tilting your head up or down .   i've had this phone for a week and i love it. it's not too big for me. it fits in all of my pockets and it has a case on it. beautiful display and great functionality! i don't even know a fraction of what this phone can do .   this phone is probably the biggest and most usable phone. has all the features that the samsung galaxy s4 has + spen etc. overall it's a great phone but when i ordered it i was told that the phone is brand new i've been having charging issues shortly after i got it.the power cord as well keeps saying use the charger that came with the phone i have been and still it's acting up went to verizon got a new charger still receiving the same message and amazon wants me too pay 700 hundred for a new send my old one back then when it's received place my money back in my account or send it in and be without a phone for how ever many days. this sucks and bites. first of all, i want to say that amazon price beats any service provider offers out there. secondly, the quick shipment from amazon and processing is awesome. now the phone, i love love love everything about it. it is big in size, but how many people have a smartphone plus a tablet. i find this phone serves the purpose of both. i love how everything is in one. i was always in love with the android operating system, so i never really had much of a problem. i found i got really frustrated with apple products a lot, and switching to the iphone was the biggest regret i had made. i just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything. secondly, i love how the note syncs with my google account, from my gmail to my calendar and my contacts. i am currently taking online classes, and i am able to log on to my school website without a problem. as opposed to my iphone i can only access certain features, and not to mention constantly having to zoom in. cons: speaker is on the bottom, so if you watch a movie in landscape, you'll feel like your hearing is off. that's all i can find for it for now .   i love it .   the phone is amazing and has so many options that i don't even know how to use most of them yet .   this phone is an amazing phone/tablet/toy/tool. it performs very well at each purpose that i bought it for. i have had it for about 3 months now and have never regretted it. the large screen is very clear and very vivid. watching videos, editing photos and surfing the web are very easy with this screen. they camera is the best i have used on a mobile device and is the envy of my iphone loving wife. the pictures are very clear and detailed. and it is very easy to use. i think it serves a very good purpose for replacing a tablet and smartphone with one device. the quality is great. if you are one of the kool-aid drinking apple fans this can be the salvation to your addiction. iphones are puny junk when compared to this thing. the removable storage is one of the many features that apple refuses to allow in the iphones and which i absolutely require in all of my devices. the only drawback is the lack of accessories. this, in my opinion, is a compliment to the fact that it is a tool and not a gadget to be used by self-obsessed, do-nothing hipsters living off mommy's money. it is a device for working, multitasking living people that want to enjoy their phone and not sit around waiting to waste their money on the next "upgrade.". as an android enthusiast first having a droid x, then galaxy nexus, then that broke and went back to a droid x2. i also was an avid custom rom user. this phone is amazing, just perfect. final thoughts: love it, best phone yet. see below for more detailed thoughts. pros: blazing fast. with the 3gb ram and quad core processor you will never run out of resources. lte is blazing fast, seems to turn on faster than huge screen with gorilla glass 3 (you wouldn't believe the difference even from galaxy nexus with it's "scratch resistant" glass). 1080p resolution (enough said). very long lasting battery. with that 5.7inch screen you better believe it will suck down power. the battery delivers. you can root it, it's a pain but it's doable. camera is really nice. custom built in camera and gallery apps are not as good as stock but still pretty good. usb 3.0 - they barely brag about this! the usb 3.0 chord and charger that comes with the phone is amazing. the phone will charge from 0-100 in like 40 minutes with the usb 3 cable. transferring files is extremely fast with the usb 3 cable (must have a usb 3 port which most new laptops and motherboards have). usb 2 cables and chargers still work with it, the charge is just a little slower. don't freak out when you see the new male portion of the usb cable, it's not proprietary, it's usb 3 and it is still backwards compatible (the right side of the usb 3 cable is the same as just usb 2). cons: the bootloader is locked so i can't load custom roms. the bloatware is annoying but it's to be expected. nfc doesn't work with google wallet even rooted- annoying, but i think then are working on it. from what i understand it's a hardware thing where the new nfc format isn't compatible. s pen is useless for me. waste of space in the handset. i'm sure it's useful for some. it's good for defacing pictures of people that you take. final thoughts: love it, best phone yet. i'll be glad to answer any questions .   i love this phone. this is my first smart phone but it has been easy to learn the different features. the graphics are clear and concise, easy to see and read. the rose gold is an excellent color too .   amazing! nothing but good reviews here. love it, it does everything i expected it to do.my life rite here .  my precious .   this is the best phone i have ever owned .   there is so much built into this device i cannot even begin to list them .   this phone is beautiful .  features galore .   screen is stunning feels great in the hand and super fast .   multi tasking is a dream .   the only down fall i could see is the size for some ppl .   size is perfect for me though. i had the note ii and this phone has been a great update to an old favorite. brighter screen, faster processor and more pen functionality. if you like big phones this is the phone for you .   absolutely love this phone. has a nice big screen and the keyboard is great. takes great pictures. easy to operate. has numerous features .   i'm an apple guy, but also travel a lot. when i saw this i tried it and am a convert. with a portable keyboard it's all i need when i travel overseas. i won't take my macbook or my ipad on the next trip. this note 3 will do it all and it's awesome. i love it and will be giving my iphone to my daughter shortly .  it's a trade up for me! i highly recommend it .   best phone i've ever owned. i was worried about the size at first, but got used to it after a few days. perfect for watching netflix or listening to music. so many adjustable features. battery life is excellent despite large display .   i bought as a gift for my wife who absolutely loves this phone. given that her eyesight is poor she really appreciated the large screen. i was surprised but she actually uses the stylus quite a bit. i find that ever since she got the phone she is much more responsive to emails as well. this was also surprising because she has been against transitioning to a touch screen keypad. in many ways this phone really bridges the gap for her between a phone and a tablet. whereas she would use her nook for internet browsing, gaming and other activities, she now does all of that on the note and really only uses her nook for reading. for years she's been telling me she had "the lesser phone" (i have the iphone). i haven't heard that ever since she started using this phone .   samsung is the best note 3 is the best its not too big get an otterbox to protect sign up for a class to learn all about it. it is a big screen easy to touch, there are a lot function easy to operation . so i like the phone  .   i just received my note 3 today and it is a-w-e-s-o-m-e .   its a lot to get use to but i'm up for the task. i am using youtube to check out some hidden tricks that i am unaware of. i gave 4 stars because the package came without my earpiece. the colors and the size of the phone is amazing. i switched from the samsung droid which drained the battery in 30 minutes. the sound from the speaker is crisp and clear. after holding the phone for a few hours it doesn't seem as big. i will check in again after using for a few months .   my new samsung galaxy note 3, bought from amazon, has meet and superseded my expectations, i love this phone, it looks good, feels great in my magnetic case, and, is well made and cute to look at, everyone loves the phone, games are more fun because you can see them, i am with samsung all the way, if the phone gets bigger i'll go bigger,you also get a voice recorder on this phone which is great, no regrets here, very pleased with my purchase .   this phone does everything i could ask of it. i'm a student and this thing is absolutely amazing for taking notes, editing documents, reading .  etc. i also love to play games which it will handle everything out there. i would not say that this phone is for everybody because of its shear size and capabilities .  my 60 year old father would not be able to figure this thing out because of all the customization it offers. beware, this phone is extremely big .  like comically big. unless you have andre the giant hands, you probably wont be able to reach from one end of the screen to the other while one handed texting, with that being said, i am always worried that i will drop it; so i suggest always using both hands. i am a very heavy user so the battery usually lasts me about an entire day with about 15% left, but i like my brightness maxed out, wifi on, games, syncing, blah blah blah. my old galaxy s3 would require a charge in the middle of the day just to make it to the end of the day with how much i use it. tl;dr i love this phone and would recommend it to anybody who needs to multitask and often burns through their battery during the day .   i love my glaaxy note 3. the screen is larger than any on the market (that i could find). it is so easy to use. if i want to learn a new function, the help guide is tremendous .   this thing is awesome. fast, screen resolution is crazy, light. added uag case and complete package. glad i chose it .   * skip to bottom summary if you do not have time to read this* let me start off by saying i am in love with this phone. i have owned it for 3 months now and can't seem to put it down. it is big enough where i do not have to squint to read emails such as on the iphone and small enough where i can text and type one-handed (i have bigger hands). the features that come packed with this phone are all very useful and great. there are honestly more features than anyone would need to use, but more is always better. it is very fast and doesn't seem to skip a beat with all my programs running in the background, as well as astounding battery life that lets me go without a charge for a minimum of 2 days. i have not had the mentioned reception issues so it may just be a bad batch of phones or the service in my area is very good. * now, i bet you're wondering why i am only giving this product 2 stars when i have just talked so highly of this product. the poor rating is for amazon customer service and their bloatware. i had initially purchased the phone and chosen an address for it to be shipped to. an hour after purchasing i recognized a different address was designated for shipping. i contacted amazon an hour after the purchase (3 days before it shipped) and told them the correct address for shipping. i was told the problem was addressed but behold, my product was shipped to the other address and i did not receive my product in time or at the correct location, not to mention the product came a day late. * once i received my phone i was willing to let the shipping mistake slide until i started looking through the programs and realized i could not delete any of the apps that amazon preloaded onto the device. granted, they are not very high in memory usage but when i spend 200$ of my hard earned money on a good product i would like to have the option of choosing which apps i need and don't need. to put it in perspective it is like buying a car and not having the option of choosing which features you want and don't want. the only thing you can do is disable the apps so they dont run in the background, but they still take up memory that should be free. the phone does come with other preloaded apps (samsung & google) that cannot be removed but they are at least desirable and used every day. i actually considered returning this phone due to the unnecessary bloatware and inability of removal, but decided that the product is too good to let a couple apps ruin its integrity. a company should not jam their products down a customer's throat and expect positive feedback. quite actually, it deters me from using your apps on any of my devices. summary: phone is a great product, much better than the iphone 4s i switched from. amazon shipping disappointed me and sent phone to wrong address. amazon pre-loads their permanent bloatware apps onto the phone (cannot be removed). my recommendation is to purchase this phone from your cellular carrier as it will come preloaded with less bloatware apps .   everyone at work laughs at me when i "answer my laptop". i don't care .  this phone is terrific and i'm looking forward to implementing this tool into my daily routines at home and work. i'll try to update this review as i uncover more positives and any negative experiences. it was quite nice to get this from amazon at a price that the verizon store couldn't match. the staff looked at me strangely when i showed them my amazon cart showing the unit selling at $199. getting the phone online was ridiculously easy. charge the battery, call my number from another phone and press a key .  phone activitation occurs. turned the note 3 on and all was good to go. keeping it simple is always the best way to go .   top dog! imo, best phone out there. great for multitasking! excellent screen, fast .   lightweight. camera takes great pictures in good lighting. s-pen works great! speaker output nice and crisp. battery life really good, if you turn off some un-needed functions like gestures, turn off gps when your not needing it, turn off auto sync, and set screen time out to 30 sec .  i been getting easy 2 days without charging with light usage like streaming youtube, web browsing and some email. call quality very good, can hear callers loud and sharp on verizon network that is. 4g blazing fast on verizon. wifi antenna can be a little stronger. overall a great phone by samsung .   my wife used this phone for about one year and she started having issues with charging correctly. she first noticed that the phone did not charge overnight and later found out that the phone only charges when the charging cable is plugged in at a certain angle. we first thought it was the phone terminal issue but when we got the replacement phone from verizon, it had the same issue. we called verizon and they transferred me over to samsung because they have known issue with the early versions of charging cable. long story short, samsung is willing to repair the cable and i will be without the cable for at least a week. they had no other options but to send in the cable and wait4-5 days .   they are basically letting the loyal consumers suffer for their fault of manufacturing poor cables. this is not what i expected from a well known brand of samsung. disappointed service .   i am coming from the galaxy nexus, so not only is this phone larger, but also faster and has multi-tasking. the phone is easy to use and i have no complaints with it. the only complaint i have is with verizon for not having an unlocked boot-loader and still has not upgraded to kitkat yet .   love the phone no complaints here! might be too big if you have a active life style it takes up your entire pocket .   great product that was delivered on time everyone will enjoy how the galaxy note 3 performs. glad i discovered how amazon works and how great the prices are in the marketplace .   quick reference review: (details below) fantastic all around! beautifully crisp screen in full hd, very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games. battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. connection on verizon is fast, for both data and calls. i haven't experience any call quality issues. camera qualities are second to none. the s-pen is a nice feature to have. phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. i can use this phone easily with one hand, but i have big hands in general. if your only issue with this phone is its size, get it. you easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands). comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as i can. bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and i am not at all dissatisfied. worth noting, i purchased this phone over the lg g2. i do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that. design: the layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. while it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. the materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. in my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microsd in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body. the phone itself is incredibly thin. i purchased a spigen slim hardcase for the phone because i wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too. hardware: this phone is fast. all the benchmark tests do not lie. this thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen samsung galaxy tab. i like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. great on wifi or lte. screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. the speakers are good, not great. they get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. if you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. i've had no issues. ui and software: if you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. if you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. i always recommend it over ios, but i don't have enough experience with windows to sway you from it. but the user interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. there are so many customization's. from different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or ocd personalities. camera: so many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. i will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. from action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram this phone with suffice for most! i always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a dslr! size: the size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. as i mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, just get it. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. depending on your size, it will be easier than others. the average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. for reference i am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. i'm always amazed how often i don't even feel it. however, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. my honest opinion is find one in person. i went to bestbuy and the samsung rep allowed me to hold his work note3. i was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. i love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience. battery life: it's amazing. the big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. so even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. if i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. but idle in your pocket with lte on all day. you'll have no issues. the usb 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. this thing charges so fast. i can get a full charge in half the time as my old htc thunderbolt. people complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone .   my only complaint: i had a few issues charging my phone. at first i was extremely upset as i thought the port inside my phone was defective. essentially, with the usb 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. the standard usb port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. my issue was that one of the 2 connections on the usb3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. this lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me "please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging". i simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. i recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent. on the other side, its worth noting you can indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro usb cords, however it will be slow. overall, just get this phone. i can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. i fought back and forth whether to get this or the lg g2 for cheaper, but i decided i wanted the best phone i could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade .   simply put. the samsung note 3 is the best product on the market in its class! i am completely satisfied with my note 3. additionally, i ordered all the currently available accessories .   love it ! this phone is great. don't even rrealize how big it is . but the picture quality is great and everything. love the size and the apps. we'll worth the money. would recommend this phone to everyone, in fact i have .   this phone is great! just a matter of getting used to its capabilities, overall no comparison to other phones in the market, even the iphones. the best phone out there, period .   i love this phone .  it's big but i that's what i wanted. i am a it administrator and this does everything i want and more. the multitasking is great, the hd screen is great, i really do not have any complaints about this phone. battery last all day even with a lot of use. warning: uses large amounts of data when setting up and installing all your apps for the first time, if you have a small data plan make sure you are on wifi .   i was very happy with my phone. it came when they said it would. my only complaint is that the activation instructions were not clear so i had to call customer service .   i finally had to break down and purchase a new phone to replace the flip i had been using for about 10 years. i chose this because it was highly rated by all the reviews i read and i absolutely refused to be a moronic lemming and purchase an ipos. the price through amazon was better than what i could do through verizon and the setup was absolutely painless. i am not too thrilled about the $50 increase in my monthly bill, but that's what you get for going from a no-frills flip phone to a "phablet" .   this is an amazing phone/phablet! it has a super-hd screen and also comes with a stylus inside a slot on the phone itself. the screen area is very large and the speakers are adequate but headphones are suggested if watching video. it has multi-screen so that users can have two of certain applications open at the same time and in split screen, such as gallery and chrome or maps and gmail. it has 3 gbs of ram and is fast! a case is needed but not a screen protector as the screen is corning gorilla glass 3 and scratch-resistant but not scratch-proof. if one does not put his or her vehicle keys in the same pocket as the device, the screen shouldn't get any scratches. i bought a screen protector the same day as when i purchased the phone but have now gone two weeks (out of three months' ownership) without a single scratch. i do highly recommend downloading a home screen launcher, such as the one i use called buzz launcher, because the programmed home screen is just ugly and cluttered. after some experimenting, one will discover which applications you can (and should) turn off to free up ram. overall, this is a highly rated phone by professional websites and, if not mistaken, the best-selling phone in the world right now for a reason. this phone is much better than the galaxy s5 and google nexus 5. another reason i bought this "phablet" is so i wouldn't also have to spend money on a separate tablet such as the google nexus 7 since this is only 1.3 inches smaller and also has a much better as well as hd screen. this is an excellent choice for anyone purchasing a new phone and i highly recommend it and would purchase again .   love the phone .  people always make fun of the size, but then they see the quality and they want one. lol. this is an amazing phone! this phone is blazing fast! i has everything i want and need in a phone without being too bulky. i know some would say the phone is big, but those are the same people who have to pinch or squint to read an email on smaller devices. if you are looking for a great all around phone, do not hesitate .  get this phone! likes: everything dislikes: none recommend: yes. love the phone. not a big fan of 4.3. very buggy. excited for the update. no phone even comes close in terms of functionality .   wow, i havn;t needed to root, unlock, and install roms at all yet. the stock rom is plenty fast enough for me and the battery life is amazing. i would typically get about one day from my s3 and i get about 2 days from the note3 .   love it! everyone says its so big but it feels just right for me. it smooth, efficient and the shipment got to me fast. i love the color too, i get compliments as most people just have black or white with silver trim, this has the unique gold touch to it. excellent phone .   phone is amazing! the large screen is awesome. size of phone is a pro and con. pro for playing games and viewing video, pics, etc. con for finding wristlets large enough to fit phone and other items. phone easily fits into front pocket in regular purses.all other features of phone are positive .   i love the phone it does so much and it's a good fit for me and what i do every day. i upgraded from my gs2. the gs3 note is absolutely wonderful! the big screen is a delight and it has so many functions it's unbelievable! sound quality for playing back mp3 music downloaded from my computer (i use amazon cloud player) is loud when i set it on high thru my ear plugs and sounds just like a clear stereo .  not distorted whatsoever. i bought an armband and used it today to go running and listened to my favorite music from my gs4 note. wonderful! i am still learning thru everything so if anything changes i'll add input, negative or positive. but as far as this seller i give 5 stars. and so far the phone has gone above and beyond my expectations. you won't be disappointed .   bought 2 of these, so i have written my full review under public name "chuck". if you don't read it, just buy one and you won't be sorry .   absolutely the greatest phone on the market. puts the iphone to shame. my son played with it for 30 minutes and within a week got rid of his iphone and got one of these. the crystal clear hd display is unbelievable. the s pen with the s note app is so easy to use and recognizes my awful handwriting flawlessly with no lag. write a name and a phone #, touch contacts and it's there instantly in your contact list. the 13 mp camera is great. the smart touch lets me transfer photos to my wife's phone instantly by just touching the devices together. the battery life is one of the most impressive features and is as good or better than the specifications claim.you can't go wrong here. get one and you'll be glad you did  .   this is an awesome phone. does not feel cheap in any way. well done to samsung. love this phone does so much. phones today are like little mini computers. just awesome phone not a bad word on anything .   i switched to this from the note2. the 3 looks better, is a bit more powerful and has a better display. not not a huge upgrade to he honest . i kind of preferred the feel of the n2 rounded edges, but the n3 square looks better .   i am giving this phone 4 stars because it is not gold on the sides like the ones at verizon. i wish i would have known. i would have spent the extra $20 at the verizon store. this one is silver on the side. not a big deal and i am more then happy with the phone itself. you're gonna love it .   it's addicting .   this is a excellent phone to use. i am so excited for this new device. i need a protect case and screen protector sheets .   wow awsom cell phone still learning all the amazing things that you can do easy to use so many things to learn. great phone, although i miss the integrated features that the iphone provides. excellent battery. i haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed: what i do love: great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures. great battery life. i had to charge the iphone i had twice a day. this i abuse and it still gets me through the day. it also has a removable battery for instant juice. family i have in the philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure. responsive in my transition, things i have noticed: -native list syncing is not present. i decided to go with wunderlist. i would have used google task, but it's not developed yet. -no button that pulls up voice command like siri does in the lock screen. the voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like siri was. you can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked. if it is unlocked, you have to find the app. there is a buttonless voice activation ("hi galaxy"), but it stops working sometimes. -google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen. when you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iphone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice). -some apps tend to freeze. i simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it. -the text size kept changing on me every time i tried to text. i found you change the default text size with the volume buttons. -i had to be creative to migrate my contacts. i moved everything to google from my iphone, then synced with my phone. one thing that is great is that i can manage my contacts now through google contacts through my gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts! -text to speech engine is awesome, better than siri in accuracy and speed, i think. -camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iphone, unless you disable security. i've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers i write afterwards, which is really nice. after the novelty of the pen, i reverted to using the on-screen keyboard. i still use it on occasion. i like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps. i have used the s-note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice. i just wish there was more integration, so i can see my notebooks on my computer. for a case, i used the otterbox commuter, which works well. it has no belt clip, but i would imagine i'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway. this just slides into my pocket. did i enjoy my iphone? yes. simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life. do i enjoy the galaxy note? yes. totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video. it's not as well integrated, but it works and does what i want. in a mobile computing device/phone that i have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience. will i stay? i think so. i will learn the phone soon enough. the experience is just different. if you have any comments, please do! i'm still learning the phone. it is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from samsung. it comes from south korea, a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy (i was there for a year and can appreciate the history). not to be confused with china or japan. i went from a s4 to the note 3 and all i can say is wow .   the difference is amazing i cant even use the s4 anymore cause the screen is so small .   this phone is nice its big, but im used to it by now .   i went from a s4 to the note 3 and all i can say is wow .   the difference is amazing i cant even use the s4 anymore cause the screen is so small .   this phone is nice its big, but im used to it by now .   i have had this phone for 1 week. i love it. it does take some time to get used to the size and find your way around all the features but it is worth it. it does everything i ask of it and it does it fast .   i'm on verizon, came from old galaxy nexus. this phone is top of the line, from the stylus to the speed and the screen, oh the screen. no regrets .   i had a galaxy note 2 and traded it for an htc one, what a mistake! i just switched to the gn3, what a great device, my all time favorite phone. also comes with evernote 1 year subscription! love amazon wireless store! hate massachusetts they charged tax on the full phone cost .   i traded to this from the iphone 5. it was the greatest change in my life. i love this phone i can go 20 hours easily even more. if you leave it in stand bye mode you can leave it for days. i just wish it had kitkat for verizon. i also wish there was a nice dock for it. its awkward because of the usb 3.0. its a different plug and if you use the old 2.0 connection it takes long to charge it. this is an excellent phone/tablet for the discriminating buyer. the picture is clear and vibrant and definitely large enough to see all tiny details, no matter which webpage you are on. i went from an iphone to the samsung galaxy note 3 and i am very glad that i made the change. before the phone arrived, i feared that it may be a little too large for me but it definitely isn't. i would recommend this phone if you are looking for a great 4g lte device with a decent screen size for webpage browsing and a great, high quality camera .   best phone ever, the price was just right. would recommend this phone to anyone looking to up grade. get it now .   too big for me to cary on my pocket. i think it is perfect for ladies who would carry it in a purse. however reading email on a larger screen is so much better experience than it is on a smaller phone. i wish i had a suitable pocket to carry it on each of my shirts and pants .   a nice phone. i like it. a different felling with iphone 5. i think that it is time the iphone should enlarge their screen size .   this phone doubles as a small compact "palm top computer," with available apps such as autocad 360, adobe .pdf, and more. swore i would never give up my casio brigade cell phone after a bad 2011 smart phone experience, but the samsung note 3 changed my mind .   this is the best android phone i've ever had! love the large display, the pen feature is a real bonus! no more typing with one finger! i can write it out and the phone types it for me! a real time saver .   this phone isn't necessarily the phone for everyone but if you go into it looking for a phablet style phone then you will love it. fast fast fast. this is my first time buying a phone on amazon. i am in love with it and i got $80 off the price verizon sold it for.they had to verify that i was indeed under contract with them and then i got my phone for the discounted rate of $219! the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because of the charger! omg it is faulty and will only charge in an upside down position .  but if there is any movement it stops charging .  it must be something within the charger itself like a loose wire .  cause i use another charger and it charges fine. so other than that little snafu .  i am super happy with my note 3 :-). i gave it 5 stars bc it deseres that i love the design of my phone nd its nice look ! very me! boss like style. perfect in every way. could not imagine a better phone. best phone on the planet to date. pen is used often and very helpful especially for web browsing .   buy it  .   i couldn't have found a better price anywhere. at first, i feared that i was going to get a refurbished phone or a phone that had been slightly used and returned. but i could tell, it was brand-spanking new. everything worked beautifully, and i haven't had a single problem with it. it was shipped overnight free of charge, and it was packaged very nicely and safe. i get a signal where my friends and family members don't get one. they have asked to use my phone when we've been buried deep within buildings and/or basements .   i loved all the specs on this phone when i was doing my research. for the most part it seemed that the phone was pretty solid for performance based on everything i was reading. my primary concern going in was the issue that i kept seeing appear regarding the call quality. i finally pulled the trigger when i saw that there was a fix for that issue. i have had the phone for over a month now and i can report that i have had no issues with any aspect of the phone. call quality has been great. i have had no problems with running any apps and even multiple apps at a time, it does not lag. the battery life is the best of any phone i have ever owned. even better than the extended battery i had for my previous phone. i can typically go at least 2 days on a charge. i consider myself to be an average user of the phone. on a typical day i will run several apps, send and receive multiple texts, do some surfing and make several phone calls. the size of the phone may be the sticking point for some people. i was a little hesitant in this respect also at first, but i can say that i got used to the size in a very short time and now can't imagine myself with a smaller phone. i love it. i think this phone was a great purchase and am not disappointed in it at all .   i switched from iphone to this android phone and love the bigger screen, the hd video & display, the camera is decent though not as good as i expected (pixelation and spotty, but does excellent video even in dark locations such as a night club), the dual video capture is fun to play with (2 screens in one video showing the person in the scene being recorded for example), it comes loaded with general apps, no games. however i've had problems with it on many google services such as hangouts and youtube sharing, many games and apps aren't supported on android, the battery is quickly used up and it takes a couple hours to charge from zero to 100%. i've hardly used the pen, but i love the design for holding the pen inside the phone body, it is secure and never loosens so far. i don't like the design of having the off button opposite the volume button as it took forever to learn how to push one without pushing them both. holding the phone on the bottom is awkward because of the menu buttons so it took some time to find a way to hold it. all in all i'd recommend it even to 1st time users of smart phones, it's very easy to set up and use, and for experienced users, to customize .   i am enjoying the note 3. i'm getting to find out more about how to use it all the time. i still haven't figured out how to delete my email such that they also delete in my primary yahoo account. i'm still learning. would recommend this device to anyone .   i purchased the note 3 after a good deal of consideration and research. first off i should relate that i'm into computers. i took my first computer course in 1972 (fortran) and have kept up with developments ever sence. i built my own gaming/general purpose rig and repair, modify and troubleshoot computers. i enjoy it. i have been watching the development of cellphones with the same interest. my first cellphone was a motorola bag phone (remember those?) and have upgraded only when i saw a definite improvement in functionallity but never did so as a matter of fashion. late last year i decided that it was time to replace my six year old lg "dumb" phone. i also had become interested in buying a high end tablet after seeing some of my young in-laws using theirs during the holidays. i had the thought that it would be great if you could buy a nice tablet that also made phone calls! of course nothing like that exists. i then began taking a harder look at the high end phones after seeing a hsn show on the iphone and decided it was time to finally make the jump to a "smart" phone. i concluded that the technology had matured to finally deliver the the functionallity that it promised and still be user friendly. after much research i settled on the samsung. i looked briefly at the s4 but felt it was to small to replicate the tablet experience that i wanted. i'm a verizon customer (no particular loyality, they just happen to have the best service for my area) so i went to the verizon store to check out the phone with a salesperson and maybe get a deal. because they are so new there are no deals on the note 3. if you feel you can wait a year the phone will certainly be cheaper and in two years it will probably be free with a renewal/upgrade. verizon wanted $350 for the phone plus $30 to connect it. they also charge a monthly fee for data use. not the plan use that you contract for but just a fee to use data. scam! but what you gonna do? i then went to my old faithful, amazon! they listed the verizon ready phone for $229 with no extra charges. i went back to the verizon store and told them that if they couldn't match the price there was no way i could ignore a $160 difference. they couldn't so i went home and ordered the phone. i'm an amazon prime member ( as an aside: if you order more than three things a year from amazon, seriously, join prime. i ordered a forty inch tv for a christmas gift and it arrived in two days. free. wow) and i got a notice that because of high demand my delivery would take a few extra days. i thought; no big deal. i wasn't even really supprised when two days after my order the package showed up on my doorstep. i opened the package and went through the basic setup. i did have to call verizon support but they were very gracious about connecting and initializing the phone. now, about the phone. this thing is amazing. the closest approximation i can think of is a laptop the makes phone calls and takes (really good!) pictures. i am new to the whole "smart" phone experience as i indicated and have been constantly amazed by the functionallity, capability, and potential of the device. i mean; dual core processor, 3 gigs of ram, 96 gigs of storage with the expansion slot. by way of comparison my first store bought desktop computer had an industry leading 45 gigs .   the android os is linux based so it has some subtle differences but not to the point of being a problem for pc users. there is definitely a steep learning curve if, like me, you are new to the whole tablet/smartphone experience. it came with almost no user instruction other than initial setup. i went online and found the samsung users manual and downloaded it. 256 pages if you skip all the lawyer stuff in the front. i also got a book on my kindle account (free) that also helps but i am convinced that, like most electronic gizmos that are continuously developing, by the time i figure out how to really use it i'll be ready for the "next" thing. youtube is also a great resource for instruction on the phone and the various apps. as to the apps; if you order the phone from amazon it comes pre-loaded with all the amazon apps and they cannot be uninstalled but why would you want to? and because google owns the android os you are joined at the hip to google and all its apps and anoying behavior and no, you cannot get rid of it. i have used google since it first came out in beta but i find them rather spooky. i'm sure the same problem (or worse) exists with the iphone. one of the first things i noticed about the phone was the very poor battery life. i was used to my old phone keeping a charge for days and i noticed i was only getting 5-6 hours of time on the note. i researched the situation and found that you should perform a certain ammount of cleanup on the new phone. built in utillities can accomplish this but the best solution is to download an app called all-in-one toolbox. get it from the amazon appstore for free. it is a highly regarded app and makes the list of top ten downloads consistently. using the app's function of disabiling background resource hogs you can up your battery life to maybe a day and a half. bottom line, the note 3 is a battery hog so you can just count on keeping it on a charger when not using it. the up side is that it charges fairly quickly. physicaly, the phone is large. even for my 6'2" oversized hands. i find myself constantly fumbling around when using it, trying to find a comfortable position. another problem is when shifting the grip on the phone i inadvertently press one of the soft keys and thereby change the screen. annoying but something that i'm sure would be a problem with any phone and particularly with smaller phones, i.e. s4. i just looked up and realized its 3 a.m. i thought this review would be about two paragraphs. i'll try to add more impressions later. bottom line; this device is, in its small way, a life changer. like i stated earlier, a laptop that makes phone calls. it's just a little too large and heavy, with a protective case (which i recommend), to fit in a shirt pocket but i have no trouble finding a way to carry it. and all those times in the past when i was away from home and i wanted to do something that required a computer and internet access and was frustrated are now history. i guess i'm now a connected dude .   great phone  .   great price. i have to admit i am still learning about it .   my previous phone was not nearly as sophisticated so theres a learning curve for me, but i'm having a blast. p.s.: the camera is awesome .   researched all of the newest flagship phones on the market and have found this is by far the most capable phone for my network. its a cdma phone and uses a sim card. the phone is not too big as some may think. fits perfectly in any pocket and does not feel bulky. still very lightweight and the s pen is very handy for snapchat and other drawing and note taking apps. very responsivea and no lag with proccessor even with multiple apps running. andriod 4.3 hopefully 4.4 coming soon way more versatile than ios. run emulators with great graphics and connects with my chromcast no problem. s beam is super easy to use and i have connected my nx300 to this for storage and viewfinder for the camara. very happy with purchase and is the best for cdma networks at the moment .   finally after years of waiting, a phone with practically everything that i want and need seems to be here. i've had this phone for over 2 months and it has a large and high quality display yet easy to hold in one hand, powerful (future proof), long battery life, good sound quality and clarity on both speakers, infrared tv remote, good camera, usb 3.0 speeds, support for latest wireless standards and optional sd card. i hope bug/performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my verizon gnexus. might need to be patient and give the phone a few daysâ€”i got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50% after 9 hours of usage and i was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much, but it improved over time. the 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80% after the same usage and only dropped 2% or 3% overnight instead of 4% to 6% like with the current one. positives: battery life charge times screen size sound quality of both speakers -- so nice not to hear chipmunks anymore signal quality (wifi and lte) camera quality in decent lighting phone stays cool during heavy usage (gaming, phone calls, etc) overall keyboard layout negatives: intermittent unexplained battery drainageâ€”maybe nsa is spying on me? :) auto-corrections on native keyboard the way that the phone and contacts features workâ€”should be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left-handed people with large hands intermittent touchwiz feature malfunctions (s voice, gestures, 1 handed mode, etc) inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety--i only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter (not earphones) since i don't have bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car. some notes: touchwiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice, but iâ€™ve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every-day use. i only have prior experience with native android and cyanogenmod and although i prefer touchwiz over native android, it still needs some serious work. for instance, i find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as smart stay, s voice, hand gestures, etc, so iâ€™ve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home. it is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using touchwiz battery life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since i got my replacement note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st oneâ€”going to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of os malfunction. with normal drainage i can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what i consider moderate usage (hangouts chatting, phone calls, iheartradio, gaming, and watching videos). considering that i have a larger screen than i had before, use more of the phoneâ€™s features and for longer periods of time while running touchwiz; iâ€™m impressed. the battery is not even 2x the capacity of my gnexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on native android or cyanogenmod. the screen is fantastic and iâ€™ve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problemsâ€”native player can handle most video formats, but does not have the same support for audio encoding. phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, the materials feel kind of cheap so iâ€™ve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics. things that i donâ€™t like: i currently know 2 other people whoâ€™ve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements. my 1st one had issues with usb3.0 connectivity, a faulty charging cable, strange tapping sound during phone calls, and a few other bugs. the other party had issues with the charging portâ€”not sure if the 3rd person had issues. my friend that always buys samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common, but this is only my 2nd samsung phone so i cannot say for sure if this is the case. auto-correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural. iâ€™m used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what i initially typed in the event that auto-correct is not needed, but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto-correctionsâ€”this is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself. should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone. hopefully apple hasn't patented this feature. as with my galaxy nexus, the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use. not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a-lot while using their phones. stylus is hard to removeâ€”good that it wonâ€™t fall out on accident though. surprisingly, it has not damaged any of my nails. interestingly, my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy--you go cimo s-line case in order to use usb 3.0, it has to switch to airplane mode--transfers donâ€™t last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on usb 2.0 mode if 5 minutes go by and usb 3.0 is not being used. this feature can also be problematic if you try to let windows convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes. wall charger has usb port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of surge suppressors .   i was really excited for this phone when it came out and wanted to switch from the iphone 5. i was just kinda disappointed. it was a really nice phone but some the things made me mad one of which was the volume control in the music player and pandora! there's not way of turning it off and it made it impossible to play music in my car. i'm just really not a fan of the android system either. it's really buggy and just not secure. the nicest feature of the note 3 is the s pen. it is super easy to use and comes in handy. the note 3 also has great battery life too! i eventually just took it back and got the iphone 5s. i haven't been disappointed one bit. i did a jailbreak and it's able to do anything the note 3 can do .   i didn't find the need to buy a smartphone until last december. i eschewed them. i had been using my dinosaur phone for the last three years. it could take abuse like no other. it might have required the battery pulled now and then to reset it, but it kept doing the job i hired it for, making calls. i always had a cheap company smartphone or my wife nearby with hers, so i didn't get one until i got this one. this phone is awesome. it's huge screen is perfect for emails, surfing the web, whatever. but that screen size comes with a price. this phone is huge. people will tease you about it. you can always show then how good of pictures it takes and how fast the shutter speed is .   or any of the plethora of other features you'll like if you get this phone. oh yeah, the battery lasts forever .   i choose note 3 for the program processing speed  .   and the internet speed .   the no delays in watching educational videos .   i'm happy with my selection and can live with it for the 2 year term with verizon .   my wife is in love with this phone ever since i upgraded her from the galaxy s3 to the galaxy note 3. nice large screen and the stylus is really cool! it is recognized by the phone just hovering it over the screen and it has it's own popup features for the stylus .   i got it sent to me the second time because the first one was defective. it restarted on its own. i returned it and amazon sends me another one .   no hassle. i got the 2nd one and i love it! really fast and light .   i have had this phone for just about 1 month and am really enjoying this phone. battery life is fantastic interface is quick the multi-pane viewing is a great feature the s-pen hand writing is a nice break from thumb typing everything the only things i feel really didn't meet expectations was the eye scrolling and gestures but these are small pieces of an otherwise amazing product .   very happy with the phone which can do it all. impressed with the look and feel of the phone. the phone is very large, but my son has large hands so its a good fit. battery life is impressive. all in all we are very happy with the purchase .   the phone is awesome its super fast smooth responsive everything you could want in a phone the s pen and the features it has are amazing and the camera's are also awesome .   this phone has a great battery life, light weight, and the large screen is phenomenal. i was happy to replace my iphone .   i had my motorola droid for years and thought i loved it - i did not know what love was. :-) i absolutely love this phone. it is taking the place of my computer on the road. works great on my verizon network .   big screen, long battery life, and powerful specs. what more could you ask for? this is the top of the line smart phone right now. beware, i have had issues with the stock charging cable.it is usb 3.0, and is slightly larger that a normal usb 2.0 from most other phones. plugging in the 3.0 charger will sometimes work, but mostly it doesn't you may have to use an old charger, but the battery is so big that it will take you a while to fully charge that way. search for "usb 3 cable not charging" on andriod central to see others with the same problem .   this phone is uncomplicated and user friendly. it's fast, no waiting, and screen quality is excellent. after reviewing many phone options, i chose the samsung galaxy note 3 and it has exceeded my expectations .   yes it is rather large. yes some people will not be able to get it into their pockets. but it is powerful and has a great hd screen. best decision i could have ever made plus the price was right. i honestly love my phone. what made my purchase so easy was the step by step instructions that were included and 2day shipping awesome .   this phone is a great phone it has so many features that i am still learning about and using everyday .   i got this as an upgrade for my wife and she truly loves it. technology in general is not her cup of tea, however the interface and the vibrant screen helps make the transition a bit smoother. here is a quick overview on the specs [ .  ] personally i'm using a motorola razr maxx but when upgrade time comes up i will need to seriously consider this .   love it does the job and the battery last a long time between charges. still learning all its ability keeps me busy .   amazon has the best price for upgrading phones like samsung note 3 for verizon wireless customers. who wants to pay more .   this phone is fantastic. i can now chuck my palm te-2 confident that this phone can perform the same funtionality. this phone is big enough to act as a small tablet too! hence the term "phablet" .   does so much more than my galaxy 3, blazing fast with verizon, even fast internet. and fits in my front pocket just fine .   as good or better than i had hoped for. this is a fantastic crazy fast phone/tool. it's size and performance allow me not to have to go out and buy a tablet .   this is the best phone i have ever had and i've had what i thought was the best but my note 3 blows everything else away .   i love it. great for me! has apps i love that i can't get on the i-phone. balances my man hands :). my sons picked this phone out for me to replace my droid and visor and it has been great! easy to use and see, tremendous battery life, great pictures. i have absolutely no complaints about it and would recommend it .   i'm so pleased i can't find any negatives. the battery seems to last forever. i get better reception and 4g than my old galaxy nexus which was pretty good. the thought and care samsung put into the ui and compatibility with other systems is outstanding. i'm not sure how much of the ui change was samsung or android 4.3 vs 4.2 on my nexus, but my note 3 runs circles around the nexus for usability. integration with microsoft exchange, skydrive, and other microsoft apps like onenote, outlook, etc. is much better and really very good .   having the ability to take notes is wonderful. paired this with a chromebook and i am in heaven. not for a person with small hands. having the large screen is wonderful .   fastest mobile device i've ever used! wish i had bought it sooner. a few tweaks of the default settings and its perfect. can't put it down! won't get into the tech specs, you should know if you are reading this review .   absolutely, positively the best phone on the market, period. look at any benchmark testing, look at the stats, look at the screen, the only downside is the plastic back, but it's 2014, who doesn't use a case or have a protection plan .   i like the big screen and so many smart features. i've owned iphone for about 4 years and i got tired of its small screen. even some of the apps on it are better that of iphone. i also like how you can type and correct at the middle of a word which iphone does not allow. also this phone is faster. oh, one important thing that i almost forgot is that you don't need to go through any program like itune to upload music and photos. you can download directly from computer to the phone. this phone is easier to use than i thought. i like it very much .   i want to start by saying note 3 is actually a wonderful phone. however, the one i got from amazon with verizon was not .   i purchased the phone from amazon wireless with verizon because they were having a really good deal for this phone .   however, it turned out to be a disaster. i first heard a static noise from time to time when i was on the phone .   and then, the fully charged battery died within 12 hours (on power saving mode) .   i don't use my phone a lot usually, my iphone 4 can last me over 2 days .   so at first i thought switching to samsung from apple was a huge mistake. then i searched online, everybody online says that the samsung note 3 is supposed to have a really good battery, actually pretty much the best in the market .   so with all these problems, i returned the phone to amazon, and went to a local at&t store and bought the same phone. it turns out that the phone's battery is really good. now my note 3 also lasts me at least 2 days, without being on the power saving mode. i am not sure if all phones from verizon are of such poor quality, or amazon wireless has bad phones, or i'm just unlucky .   but at least amazon's return service is good. so if you get a bad phone as i did, you can at least send it back .   this handset not only met my expectations but exceeded them. samsung has really, really upped their game since last i expweienced their smartphones. i never likes the way they handled mms especially. now, this is as seemless as sms, the group messaging has improved to the point of not nearly needing a separate app any longer and the multi-tasking features have thoroughly impressed me .   my husband just purchased this as a replacement for his galaxy nexus. he is thrilled with it. he loves the multi-tasking abilities, the vibrant screen, and the extra-long battery life. while at first it seems a lot larger than other phones, my husband has adapted to it and wouldn't want the screen to be any smaller. the only time that the size is a nuisance, is when he tries to carry in his front pocket. the phone is extremely fast and efficient. he didn't think that he would use the s pen but he loves it and uses it all the time. this phone is like having your own personal computer with you at all times - there's really nothing that it can't do. according to him, "the i-phone is mickey mouse play compared to the note 3.". so much easier to see and use than my previous smart phone. stays charged much longer too. love key board too .   i will never go back to the iphone .   love this phone .   this phone will do anything .   best phone i've ever owned .   there is absolutely nothing that i don't love about this phone. i recommend it to literally everyone and tell them what a phenomenal deal i got on it through amazon ' s verizon upgrade offer .   i choose 5 stars because this device deserves no less than 5 stars. pros: bright display large screen fast processor lots or ram great device cons: does not have kitkat yet. c'mon samsung/verizon .   i would recomend this to anyone who wants an awesome phone .   i searched for a phone for a while. this is by far the best i've ever owned. the screen is vibrant and a great size to view everything from movies to games. the raw processing power is noticeable, screen to screen transitions are smooth. heavy apps load and run flawlessly. the battery lasts for 2 or so days under moderate use; even being inside a structure that prevents 4g/3g signal. the phone is large but one handed operation is easy, it even comes built in. all in all i really have nothing negative to say, i'm completely satisfied. great job samsung .   the samsung galaxy note 3 on verizon wireless picks up right where its predecessor left off, making key upgrades to the design and display, while adding a bevy of new stylus features. add in the powerful processor and superb multitasking chops and the note 3 easily wins our my award for phablets on verizon. the note 3 was more than i expected. the hardware/specs is what a top smart phone should have. the screen is bright, big and a delight to view a web page or movie. i like a phone with power and this smart phone has it. it you want a real smart phone this is it .   this phone is the best phone i have ever had, the amount of processing speed this thing has is incredible. also the design is awesome it is slim and if you have big hands fits right in (small hands you will likely have to go two hand like i do). i also have a defender series otterbox on it and it still fits in my pocket. but beware when you get this phone your friend may say things like "nice tv you got there" so as long as you have tough skin and good friends this is definatly the phone for you .   owned the original galaxy note. i was excited to get this at a wonderful price for the holiday. love the samsung quality phone. big screen, all the features. only thing i noticed is you have to talk on speaker phone most of the time or you hang up on caller. this happens alot where my face touching the screen hangs up on people. not good .   the best phone i have ever owned. this phone will be at the top for a long time to come .   i was a big concerned about the size, but since i'm not one who has a phone stuck to my ear while walking around in public i thought it was more important to have a phone i could actually read and type on. the first thing i did was watch some of the youtube videos on tips & tricks for the phone to get a better understanding of it and it's amazing what you can do with this phone. i'm a realtor and this phone has now replaced my need to carry tablet with me in case i need signatures and or need to look up something onlline for a client - and they can see it .   great phone. love it. easy to activate. the large screen is a major plus for me. the s pen is fun to use .   if you are tired of an iphone (which i'd imagine no one is .   sad because the iphone 4 to the 4s was a bigger leap from the 4s to any of the 5's . . . why? steve jobs. sadly he is gone and apple will never be the same) get the galaxy note 3 .   yes it does suck a little because you don't have seamless integration via other mac products. guess what? who cares .   this is a far superior phone and i could go into specs but just read the reviews because i'm too lazy to write them. i had a 4s for two years, then got the 5s and was disappointed to them max!fix the freakin' aspect ratio you fools. this is the third iphone 5 and they still fell flat. pathetic. truly unacceptable. it's not even 16x9. why? yep, no steve jobs. this is rudimentary and apple still doesn't get it. unacceptable. so i got the note 3. this baby will blow you away. and if you get a wallet case (cellto wallet case is awesome) then it is not that bad at all to put up to your ear. it begins to not feel like a tablet (which is beneficial because this pretty much is a tablet too). amazing phone. proud of samsung for getting it together and delivering! and then some. love the pen as i am a filmmaker and just creative :) get it .   i realize most out there aren't tech save. so have fun with your iphone. the galaxy note 3 combines both worlds. technicality and user friendliness. don't believe or don't care? have fun with an inferior phone. and i love apple. always have had both pc and mac computers. but innovation will never match what steve jobs did for apple. he laid out the blueprints for multiple devices to the world to expand on. i guess apple didn't get the memo. clearly. they've reached their pinnacle and can only attempt to catch up to what was already handed to them. again, pathetic. disappointing. if you're serious in getting a great phone, buy the note 3. if not, get whatever the hell you want. it will be inferior. choose as you will. to each is our own .   i love this samsung galazy note 3. some might find it being slightly larger than most note phones but i knew it was a bit larger & wanted something with a bit larger screen display. i'm in my 50's & as you get older seeing small or fine print is important, so i bit larger screen is a huge plus & out weighs the need for a smaller pocket size phone. being a woman it really isn't cumbersome because it's easier to find in my purse than a smaller phone. i simply love this phone .   light, sleek, bright, quick. the call quality is good - better than my old droid max. antenna seems to be good. i've had this phone for a few weeks and i can't find anything wrong with it. it will run down the battery if you are streaming for hours and playing with it constantly like it did when i first got it. i charge it every night and use it for both work and personal use .   still learning about all of the features of this phone but i am very satisfied with this phablet. the size may not be for everyone, but you quickly adapt to that size and for me this was a feature on a smartphone that i was looking for. the battery life is very good. thumbs up to samsung .   i love this phone .   the battery life on the note 3 is excellent, can go 2 days without a charge .   bought it as a gift and she loves it! large screen, fast, gets updates and since she plays a lot of games on it, it's exactly what she needs .   the battery holds up well. the call clarity is great when the call is established within the primary network coverage area. this phone gets a signal when i am at work, while most of my coworkers have little to no signal. the larger size is great for working on the go, too. i have watched many hours of streaming media across both 4g and wireless networks with the phone showing no issues. i have yet to push this product to its limits, i suppose, because it maintains its responsiveness even when running multiple apps simultaneously .   i have owned motorola phones for the past 10 years. i dont know why i didnt switch to samsung earlier. this monster has great battery life and limitless capabilities. love this phone .   the phone is fantastic. the only reason i have not given it 5 stars is simply because the flash for the camera has not worked since it was taken out of the box. i will be switching it out for another one as soon as i find the time to .   i upgraded from an htc thunderbolt - which i thought was a great phone until i upgraded to the note 3. the size is a bit of an issue. i like the large screen but i don't like the large size of the phone. obviously you can't have one without the other so i'm adjusting. the large format makes reading on the phone much, much easier. in fact, i find myself using it more and more in place of my tablet! oh and 1 more "note", the battery seems to last forever .   this is by far the best phone i have ever owned. it is replacing a galaxy siii which is a dwarf in comparison. huge beautiful screen and an overall powerful device .   i have a white galaxy s3, still a year into my contract. once i found out what note 3 can do over my gs3, i got it. it's expensive than the gs4, it has almost the same capabilities as note3 but the later have much more. what i like: ( i can only compare it to what i have - samsung galaxy s3) quad-core processor - it's way faster than the s3, what a different. the s3 is not a sloth by all means. high-definition screen - what a different again. as clear as an iphone or better. screen size - i can compare it to my stand alone gps when i hook it on my windshield. like lcd tv, bigger screen is better. camera 13mp - much more clearer in interior settings and almost no lag time - quick, that's the quad-core at work video - so much clearer, faster, and nicer than the gs3 battery life - much longer - i have to charge the s3 daily. wi fi signal strength - way better than the s3. work as a pda - that's what i use it mostly for and the pre-installed bundled apps from amazon, google, tools, and samsung on a folder. the rest can be had through apps download. sound - phone and music are much clearer than the s3. it has better bass sound. the note - pad, notebook, scrap book, to name a few is amazing. what else it can do are to many to describe but they're great. os android version 4.3 jelly bean - is much improved. plastic back case - nice design. i have no problem because i have it on a hard case. more short cut icon to choose from. i can't believed i have it. . . . . . what i am not fond about: the screen page is limited to seven and it does not go all the way around. however, i decided this time to use folders and bunch similar together. google navigation - it's not provided, don't know why? those available on google play store does not let the use of contacts for destination. this is the one i'm missing. that's my personal opinion. i will let other reviews covers other items on the notes. v , note pad/notebook,. about 3 weeks with this phone and it is great so far. great pictures, large clear to read screen, easy note taking, great phone & phone messaging, movies, internet, google, email, very useful calendar, contacts,and much more. has many features that are very useful, i may even seek a "learning course" to put to use all that is has in it .   i love my gn3! the screen is huge and beautiful! so clear. i've only had it a couple of weeks so still have much to learn. no regrets .   i'm an android (and samsung) fan .  and this phone just validated that for me .   call quality was improved from my nexus prime. battery life is better. the screen is beautiful. the s-pen is nifty to use. i was daunted by the size initially, but i didn't notice it after a few days of use. a good cover to help your grip is definitely beneficial. now, other phones tend to look comically small .  funny how you adjust to it. also, watching how-to/tip videos helped me quickly learn how to best use the device. this is my favorite phone in 15+ years .  highly recommended (if the features appeal to your preferences, that is) .   this is a smart phone that is easy on the eyes. i haven't used all the features yet, but i am looking forward to learning all that it can do .   still learning how to use it honestly. it is leaps and bounds above my old lg revolution. fast, powerful, handles everything you throw at it, but probably won't handle a lot of "throwing" like the old revolution could. more delicate. no gorilla glass. great camera for video and pics. also, biggest issue is not being able to tether phone to computer via usb to work on files. with so much storage available (i have a 64gb card in addition to the 32gb on board) i feel like its a waste and have to use google drive now .  which sucks data up very quickly. overall the phone is what i expected, other than the latter issue and i look forward to learning more about it .   love, love love! so you would have to want a big phone. i carry a purse so it doesn't bother me at all. i love the huge screen. i actually watch shows on & it's comfortable it doesn't really feel like it's a phone. i mainly upgraded from the noteii for the camera which i use everyday to capture kids/moments. for that alone it is a big improvement (8mb to 13mb + a bunch more modes & controls). there are voice commands & new s pen capabilities. so it is worth it for me because i use all of them a lot. if you are torn between the note 2 or note 3 i would go with the 3. you will have for 2 years & the technology is worth it. oh internal memory is 32 gb too! nice for all the photos & videos you will capture! it is a really fast overall great phone! i can't imagine anyone not liking all the great features .   it's a big phone but the price was unbelievable and i love the phone itself. the screen is awesome and with older eyes it sure makes it nicer. when i have to show my parents how to do something on their iphones it is really a struggle .   the best phone / phablet in 2013/2014. perfect for business and entertainment. samsung doesn't disappoint. love the camera. (smooth motion video 1080p). -dr max nguyen. this was a long anticipated wait for me .   i have been waiting since november 2012 to get my hands on one of these i would frantically search to see the latest stats, pro's and cons and i must say the phone is perfect .   i am amazed at how huge the screen is all the while the phone is soooo lightweight .   it is very slim and feels as if nothing is in my hand. i have toyed with some things at first glance the graphics have my pupils like woooooow .   i made the tragic mistake of bluetoothing over all my pics from my previous phone first before downloading apps and its about 1200 photos, videos and music .   my fault for that(drained my battery) but other than that on first hand i love, love, love, love my new phone .   =) 1/25/14 it is nice to have a phone that can go 1 day and a half without being on charge. i took phone off charge at 745am. worked 13 hours and went out to the bar after work took pics, and mild to moderate social networking while at work (shhh .  lol and went to sleep with battery at 33% woke up 7 hours later phone is on 30% .   love love love my phone. i do frequently make sure i close all apps on the phone to conserve my battery .   still learning new things on my phone .   i had been wanting to upgrade to one of the newer notes for a while. i had the original note and held off until the note 3 came out. amazon had the best deal and i am very please i waited. this phone takes care of all my business and home chores .   i love the galaxy note 3, i upgraded from a note 2 which is why i gave it only four stars. out of the box, the battery doesn't last as long and for some reason the speakers don't sound as good to me as the note 2. it also has some software issues that mess with my wifi connection. however, i made some modifications to fix this issues. it is a great phone and i am very happy with it .   like other good quality smart phones, this phone is well made and has great performance. there for, it is better to write about features this p hone has and others don't. the size of the screen and quality or clarity it has kept me away from my computer. i basically do almost everything with this phone. what separates it from other phones is the ability to take notes using the included s pen with ease. you can actually write down something on the notepad and let you link it to something else. for example, you can write down someone's phone and click on it to initiate the dial keypad. or write a website or physical address and click on that to bring up a browser or a google map to navigate. basically there is no other phone that competes with galaxy note 3 in this regard. with the auto correction feature when typing something, it is difficult to have typos in what you are writing. the thing that follows your eye when reading to help you scroll works but not sure how to make it do that on purpose. it just does it every now and then. when reading small prints, you can hover over the content with a finger and it magnifies the content. a lot of cool features i have yet to figure out. the battery life is great. it has a good size battery that lasts more than a day with normal use. youtube and use of pandora may require you to charge or plug it for a few minutes .   i don't use a cell phone a lot, but i love the functionality of this phone. it is more like a mini tablet. the pen that comes with it is very handy, and activates the phone when you pull it out. it is also great for more precise selections and for note taking. i am very happy with the resolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen. buying the phone from amazon and setting up a new verizon account was painless. i easily got the account and on-line payment set up without a hitch. i also transferred my at&t phone number to the phone without any problems. i won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page. i just want to let you know what i think of it as a user of the phone. at this point in time, i couldn't be happier with this phone or the verizon service. update 5/07/16 i've had this phone for a little over 3 years, and i still have no desire to get a new phone. i did, however, recently decide to switch my service provider from verizon to t-mobile because of the offerings of t-mobile which i won't get into. i was assured by the t-mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked, i could replace the verizon sim card with the one from t-mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the t-mobile sim card. i am updating this review so that others don't experience what i did if they want to change their provider. first of all, verizon has never locked any of their 4g phones. verizon uses a cdma network which is also used by sprint and us cellular, t-mobile and at&s use a gsm network. one difference is the polarity used, so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network. the other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the gsm network customer information is stored on the sim card. this means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work.gsm carriers must accept any gsm phone. so they don't have control over the phone you are using. cdma carriers use network based white lists. so you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission, and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone. there are other differences between the two network types, but those i have mentioned affect the end user the most. in my case, i had to buy a new phone in order to switch to t-mobile as a carrier. i was also told by verizon that this phone "may" work with another cdma carrier, but it my lose functionality. i have had to buy another phone to use the gsm network, and have decided to get the galaxy note 4 since i have to give up my note 3. i hope this helps other in choosing a carrier and a phone .   great phone, does everything that i ask for my smartphones to do. larger size takes a little getting used to but it makes browsing and email much easier to navigate .   i love this phone. i've loved every galaxy phone that i've owned. i've had it a couple months now, and i haven't noticed any lag. this phone might not be for you, if you have small-sized hands. fits well in my front pocket .   awesome phone, does everything but make dinner for you. if you've had an android smartphone, pretty easy to learn how to use .   perfect size for quick document display, easy to use, extraordinary battery life, extremely clear and beautiful photos - i bought a bluetooth headset for the phone. love it. love it .   i would have to say that 90% of my computer usage is via my mobile phone now-a-days. and i constantly read tech news and keep up to speed on advancements in mobile computing. only having my note 2 for a year, i was in the market for a new phone because i decided to switch to verizon. i was torn between the note 3 and the htc one max. most would say these are not fair comparisons because they are not in the same tier. but for me, the one max was very enticing. i loved the idea of the front facing speakers, slightly larger screen, and better build. but what sold me was: replaceable battery, better gpu in the snapdragon 800, and amazing amoled screen. i'm partial to the screen due to the deep blacks and infinite contrast. what has surprised me about the phone is the new quick charge 2.0 feature in the sd800. it charges extremely fast .   i love this phone! it is big but you get used to it. i look at other phones now and think they're too small now. battery life has been fine. it charges super fast! amazon had a great price. there was a little issue with verizon as buying from the site set off a fraud alert but it was cleared up quickly with a phone call .   the best smart phone that i ever had. interface is excellent, touch screen works well and there are plenty of apps from google play store .   i give this phone five stars because it has met every expectation i had for it. the note 3 is a great phone. it's fast and it's multi tasking capabilities are awesome. and to top it all off it has a stylus pen that is great for doodling taking notes an also very helpful when it comes to photo editing. the large screen is great for everything and the battery last me all day. i love this phone. at first i thought size would be to big, but it's perfect for me. i don't need my readers when using it . it has so many features i have yet to but will get to. overall it's the best phone i have ever owned .   everything as advertised and described. a bit difficult to navigate and can not load pics directly to facebook from photo album .   i keep learning new things about this phone each time i use it. it has replaced all my tv remotes in my house. i no longer use my ipad because this can do even more than the ipad can. my wife has the iphone 5s and uses my phone every chance she gets. the note 3 is so light, even with its screen size, that it easily disappears in a pocket. the only reason to buy the iphone 5s is because you have not tried a note 3 yet .   crazy phone huge screen fast and i haven't had a problem yet. the battery life is great and i'm also a huge fan of the speak texting it has i could never go back to iphone. if your thinking about this phone then get it. excellent phone, recommended. long battery life, high performance. memory seems to be plenty and the phone runs pretty smooth at all times. recommended to restart the phone every so often for better performance. i got the smart cover case and works wonders. would suggest this phone .   i thought the phone may be to large for me but is just about right. i had the samsung galaxy s4 and i was able to work it with one hand easily but the note 3 took a little more effort to get used to. it has an option to change the layout of things for one handed use and that's good. the display is awesome! the battery life is excellent. it still fits it my pocket too. i like it and would recommend it .   i have used many apple and android products .   this is the first phone i can say that i loved. yes, the screen is huge, but that's a good thing! it does fit in your pocket (it fits everywhere my last phone did). battery is good but not amazing. i usually get a day and a half out of it, but i have killed in less than a day by playing games/browsing for 4+ hours .   phone is everything previous reviews have noted. more phone than 90% of folks would ever use. one thing that has been a bit of a disappointment has been reception. as some have noted this phone for whatever reason on verizon , reception is average. i am 2000 ft from my cell tower and have yet to see more than 4 mb down on 4g. when i am closer to other towers i have seen 39mb down on 4g so i know the product is capable. mind you it is possible that this tower is saturated as i never saw more than 13 mb down on mydroid razr maxx. voice reception has dropped off as well and at times fades out but returns in the same location. never had that issue with the razr. here is hoping that software updates resolve some of it .   other than that .  amazing device. phone is a mini computer.powerful,fast,reliable and looks good. exceeds my expectations.i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great smartphone .   i did a lot of research before purchasing my first smart phone. i am love the big screen and the stylus for me works extremely well. i plan on keeping this phone for some time .   loved the price, quick delivery, and the item! everything worked out as promised and i couldnt be more satisfied than i am .   over the years i've always had great phone's, however; i must say this is the best phone i have ever owned. i had taken four months to research all of the phones out there and am pleased that i settled on the 'samsung galaxy note 3". many of my friends and family tried to talk me out of it, stating it was just to big, and it certainly does look big on display, but once you get it in your hand, it fits perfectly! now that i own it, all of my friends and family want one! the look and feel of the phone is amazing! the size of the screen is awesome! i also love how you can 'hand write your text messages with your stylus pen, or you can hand write and have it automatically convert to a block style message or you can still use the keyboard if you like! i always hand write my text messages as i've never liked using a keyboard. i also love that i can jot down notes with my stylus pen, i use this feature a lot for my work. the speakers sound great - when listening to music, the mix of tones is crisp and clean while blending beautifully! i use my phone all of the time, and the battery life is amazing and especially compared to all of my previous phones! i can't say enough good about this phone. i've owned it for a month now and still haven't even touched on all of the great features this phone has! i hope they come out with a galaxy note (4) in a few years because there is no doubt that will be my next phone! thanks amazon! your impeccable service is appreciated .   this phone is awesome! it can do almost anything. the battery lasts for 2 days before i need to charge it. there are so many things that it can do that i need to go online and learn about all it's capabilities. very happy with my purchase .   when buying this phone it does not tell you that you need a sim card. so, when i received it i could not use it because no sim card. the order shows a sim # so why no card .   phone is incredible. only issue is it will freeze up every once in a while and have to take the battery out and put it back on. at first i wasn't sure if i liked it. the phone seemed to have a few glitches but seem to have worked itself off. no sure if its new or refurbished. either way, it works well. i give 5 stars to shipping though; phone arrived fast .   love the big screen and the speed. it replaced both my old nexus phone and my nexus 7 tablet. the note 3 does all i need when on the go .   what i have seen so far i love it! verizon's plans are kind of expensive though. haven't figured out an easy way to carry it around .   i am really please with my new phone. i'm so glad i made the choice to purchase it. i can do everything that i normally do on my ipad right from my phone. this is my first galaxy so i am learning as i go. but i'm very pleased. love the s pen .   so far i love it! just got it a few days ago, but already easily adjusted to the screen size (which was my biggest concern). it's really only a little bigger than my old phone -- droid razr. they have a function that makes it easier to use with one hand if you like, but i find i can still reach around and do most things with a little stretch (i have small/average hands). the stylus is really awesome, especially that i can take notes in lecture and not have to worry about my hand making marks on the screen when i rest it (which was a huge problem with my ipad). with the stylus and the s note app (comes pre-installed), i can write in it as clear and naturally as in a paper notebook (huge bonus when it comes to storing notes, and wishing i had them to refer back to years later but didn't want to store those notebooks forever). no gripes yet, but i'm pretty vocal. if i come up with one, i'll post it! oh, and huge tip from the verizon lady -- the old chargers work! the plug is totally different, and supposedly the included charger will charge it faster, but the older plugs actually fit and charge the phone! so happy i don't have to get all new accessories (car charger and more wall chargers for work and home). recommend this one over the s4 -- does the same stuff, but bigger with a little more functionality (supposedly the processor is faster too) .   i'm a long time smartphone owner. i've had the samsung galaxy note 3 for only a few weeks but i'm so glad that i purchased it. it does as much to meet my needs as any tablet & it is a phone also. i've heard some complaints about its size, but for me that is an asset that enables me ,with my senior citizen eyesight, to be able to address all of the features built into the unit as well as maximize all of the features offered in the installed software .   i thought it was a good phone so i bought it.and you could do a lot of things with it an i like the way everything sonic. lovely phone, pretty much does everything it says! i'm happy with my purchase and it feel great in my hands .   this is my 5th samsung phone and i love the new features. i haven't figured out all of them but the ones i have used are great .   twas the day before christmas i sat by my tree and opened the amazon box that contained my note 3 the box it was beautiful the phone even more i followed the guide to the letter and was online by four i downloaded my apps from the great google play christmas had come early on that wonderful day there's so much to learn about this beast of mine i'll write more about it some other time for now it's just calls and music and text i will have to say it's just as good a sex .   so far so good i love this big guy! luv the big screen and the volume is awesome when watching a movie :) no complaints thus far .   this phone is awesome. has lived up to everything that i heard about it . the pictures are very clear. this phone is pure awesome. end of story. lightning fast, full 1080p screen (which is mind-blowingly clear) - this phone has a lot going for it. however, motorola has samsung crushed when it comes to user-friendliness regarding typing. let's face it - everyone gets annoyed now and again with auto-correct. but at least motorola's auto-correct is intuitive, and understands when it changes "staind" to "stained" - and you go back to change it back to "staind" because it's actually what you meant .   motorola understands "ok, you really meant to spell it that way .   we'll let it go." samsung corrects you again. and even better, on a motorola droid - when you hit "backspace" after an auto-correct, it changes "stained" back to "staind" because it realizes you actually meant it that way. and, again on a motorola, when you hit "sym" to get your comma, then you hit comma, when you hit the spacebar to go to the next word - the keyboard changes back from symbols to letters for you. on samsung, you have to hit "sym" again to return to the qwerty keyboard. minor things .   i know .   but it's very surprising samsung gets these things wrong. i'd think by now, they would've had time to realize these inconveniences in their keyboard programming, and fix them for us. maybe someday .   regardless .   the phone is a true power-house of performance. handling every multi-tasking thing you can throw at it, without skipping a beat and still begging for more .   this is a great phone. i have owned the note 2 from sprint. it was a good phone too, but sprint service was terrible at home and work. i upgraded to the note 3 with verizon and can not be happier. great phone from samsung and great service with verizon. i would definitely recommend this product to anyone. you can't go wrong with this phone .   awesome phone. came packaged very secure easy setup. wonderful experience. couldn't have chosen a better phone. i am a samsung faithful.  .   everything i expected. fast and easy to use. i got a flip case because it's too big to easily keep on a belt clip .   i was hoping for so much more. i upgraded from the galaxy nexus to the note 3 in hopes of having a more productive phone. the only reason to buy the note 3 is the stylus and ability to write notes (otherwise it's no different than any phone except much bitter). while the device does a good job with transcribing my chicken scratch, i find it hard to write small enough to fit an email address or other notes. the biggest annoyance i have is that some of the features that made this phone device to desirable just aren't that good. mainly the split screen apps. the system locks out most of the apps and only allows a small handful of apps to be use. you have no control over the apps. so if you want to watch slingbox or hbo go while texting or sending emails you cannot do it. additionally, the buttons are a bit different than what i am use to. my favorite button was the window selector that allows you to switch apps. doesn't exist on the note 3. you have to hold the home button for a couple seconds. i find this very annoying. this device has a lot of promise but samsung did a horrible job of allowing people to actually use the device. i wish i could have got the s4 or something else. i would have no problem trading away the "bonus" features of the note 3 .   i love the phone. it has worked superbly for me. i came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time. there are two things i'd like to talk about with this phone: size, and samsung's customer service. size: i can never go back to a smaller screen. i really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that i almost drop it sometimes when i don't have a good grip on it. i love having so much screen real estate! i love it and i will never go back. in general though, i don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature. i'm 6'2" so i'm somewhat taller than average, so it may be that i'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit. samsung's customer service: terrible. i don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done. i don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way. that's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone. get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better! anyway, it started with my phone arriving. i opened the box and got right into everything, then noticed that there wasn't an included headset. i just thought, "wow, are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset(that probably costs them $1 to make) with their most expensive phone?" so i contacted customer service to see if there was any way i could get one. i had sold my pair of beats headphones since i don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking i'd use the stock headset that i thought would come with it. i basically got a flat "no." my next aggravation came when i saw a news article that said "free $50 google play credit for note 3 customers." i quickly made my way to the link provided, only to be met with a screen that said "due to the high demand, we have run out of our supply of credits. thank you for your interest!" the promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks. really samsung? i contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits. again, a flat "no." these are somewhat little things, but it's the little things that make good customer service, and i feel like samsung fails miserably in that department .   after 6 days, 37% battery remaining; that's pretty amazing! my last phone (droid bionic) lasted two days max. alright, i'm not a really heavy user. i check email a couple of times a day. i make 6-10 phone calls a day. i do some web browsing when away from my desktop computer and run a few apps. otoh, i'm often connected to wifi (at home or away). bluetooth is off right now, so that probably saves some juice. what i miss from the droid was the availability of dedicated docks for car and desk. but it would overheat in the windshield dock, which i'm hoping won't happen with the note 3. one other negative i've noticed is the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers. i have to be careful to only press the power switch. i'm a 6' tall guy and the size of this is not a problem. i chose it as a way to have a single device rather than carry a tablet in addition to my phone. carrying it in a pocket of a travel vest is no problem. i think it would be too large to carry on a belt. the camera seems to perform like a phone camera: ok in good light only. at a dimly-lit party with flash on produced smeared images due to excess in-device noise reduction. love the size for browsing my calendar and email. web browsing is better than on a phone, but not really competition for a tablet. just getting accustomed to the s pen and find it better than a conventional stylus. have barely scratched the surface of the extra functions. speaking of just scratching the surface, i find that i'm going to have to set aside time to partake of some tutorials in order to really get the most out of the note 3. my first smart phone was a blackberry six years ago, then i graduated to the droid bionic. the power of this phone -- plus features of android 4.3 -- encourage me to learn to live up to what it can do. since this is my only portable device, i went for a sandisk extreme 64 gb microsdxc class 10 uhs-i memory card, which brings my total available storage close to 100 gb  .   might as well be equipped to take maximum advantage of this beast .   bought for great price as a new verizon customer. i learn three days later could have gotten it $20 cheaper. also could have gotten a s4 instead s3 for same price. all good things come to those who wait. over all i am still happy .   i absolutely can't live without my note 3 now. i had a note ii for several months, and just had to have this one. the advancements over the ii are like comparing regular unleaded fuel to racing fuel. yes both will get you where you want to go, but damn the trip is much more fun with racing fuel .   to preface the entire review, i was researching this device with vzw for over 2 months. amazon has always had the lowest price, verizon couldn't even come close to matching it. the process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information. when trying to go through the process vzw customer service verified who i was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information i needed. luckily the amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what i needed. while i was on the phone with vzw, at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories (which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing). after finally receiving my phone two days later, i tried activating my device. i spent over 4 hours on the phone with different vzw reps to help activate the device. no one could help me. i guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day, but they ported my number from sprint already. i was without service for almost 1 whole day. the following day was thanksgiving when i needed to activate it, but vzw's support number was closed due to the holiday. luckily i was able to connect with someone at amazon who had a direct contact number, who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running. if it wasnt for amazon i would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone. after buying the device at $199.99 on nov 26, i found the device price was lowered. i called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the $50 difference. which increased the monetary value for amazon wireless even further! the only down side (besides hours on the phone trying to activate) was the fact that although i ordered the protection plan through vzw when ordering with amazon, verizon had no record of that. as long as it is within the first 30 days you can call vzw to add it. i had read a previous review that said that, which made me double check a week later after activation. all in all, i had a lot of hiccups with the process, but the amazon wireless customer service made right by everything i went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business. i will definitely go through amazon for my next mobile purchase .   this is a great phone. i love the big screen. the phone is fast, which is very important to me since my last phone had a very long and annoying lag time when i tried to make phone calls. apps run quickly. the camera takes nice pictures. a couple of annoying things about it are: 1) the audio volume rockers are directly opposite the screen on/off button, which results in many unintentional presses that change the volume when trying to turn off the screen or turning off the screen when trying to adjust the volume. 2) there is no way to turn the sound on and off from the lock screen. also, the rocker switch doesn't have any effect with the screen off or the lock screen on. to silence or un-silence the phone, it's necessary to unlock the phone and then use the volume rockers. 3) the video recording software freezes often .   this phone is awesome. really does what it says. i have my own business so appointment setting is easy with features. the multi screen feature is a plus. easy to talk on phone will surfing the net and google map at the same. the screen is big enough for this feature. also the s pen is awesome for note taking or jotting down orders. last but not least the screen is bright so outside use is no different from inside and battery is awesome heavy use for me is 10 hours .   hands down the best phone i have ever owned. this was shipped fast and was also the cheapest place to get it. arrived quickly, works awesome and i love the phone. has been a blast setting it up and learning many of it's new functions. i found you-tube videos extremely helpful to discover what the phone is capable of. thank you .   best phone ever except for the speaker is a little cheesy other than that awesome and has decent amount of battery life. got it for 299 on no contract price! this thing is siiiiiiccckkk! i am currently getting about 28 hours out of a charge with heavy use .   this phone met all of our expectations. the screen is brilliant and sharp. it is large for a phone but it serves as a small tablet and lets face it we use smart phones more for surfing and texting than talking .   i love my phone i am extremely happy with it it froze once but that was it other than that i haven't had any issues with it .   size matters .   so make sure yours is bigger. this review doesn't matter to your decision. go to your search engine, search note 3 reviews, read the reviews and buy it because it's and awesome phone .   love the size of the screen. doesn't feel silly big. the camera is awesome and love some of the s pen features. the four stars is for some dropped calls and it seems to change ring volume, not sure if this is the phone or some app. this is not a deal breaker because i really like some of the other options .   this is my favorite phone yet. at first i thought that such a big phone would be inconvenient. for me that was not the case at all. i can't speak for everyone though, and i would encourage anyone looking to buy this phone to look at it in the store, and see what it feels like in the pocket, etc. the phone isn't tablets sized, it's still just a big phone. i have no problem putting it in pockets, but i have big pockets. what i really like about this phone is that it really blurs the line on what a phone is vs. a tablet / a kindle / a portable game system. this phone has no problem doing any of those things. i can use full web pages, not just the mobile versions. i can read a book from the google play library or the kindle types very easily. it plays plants vs zombies 2, minecraft pocket edition, stuff like that. the battery life is excellent. you'll only get a few hours gaming, but doing almost everything else, you get quite a lot. it charges quickly. the screen is gorgeous. the stylus is quite handy - i find myself using it quite a bit. i like the fact that it's attached into the phone, making it difficult to lose (there's a setting where the phone reminds you not to leave your stylus behind if you walk away). all in all a great phone, perfect for my uses .   this phone is amazing! the screen is beyond nice and the camera is better than any standard digital camera. the ability to work on two windows is incredible .   fast and tons of memory. this came with 32gb (compared with the 512mb of my old epic 4g) and a slot for another micrsd card. i added my old 32gb one. reserve several days to learn all the functions of this feature rich smartphone .   i have always been a 'galaxy' girl, since it first came on the scene, i absolutely love this note 3 .   it's everything samsung says it is .   i'm buying the galaxy gear as well as the galaxy tab 3 10.1 .   #teamsamsunggalaxy. amazing cellphone. i'm very happy with it. all the details of this cell here is true, for me is the only and also can you use two applications simultaneously. i really like the battery is also durable. i recommend it .   nothing more to say about this phone but "love it". most expensive and valuable phone since i ever had the phones! hope samsung add some more s-view functions .   nothing more to say about this phone but "love it". most expensive and valuable phone since i ever had the phones! hope samsung add some more s-view functions .   i was excited to have this shiny new phablet, until i started to use it. i am new to samsung, so i figured the ui would take a little getting used to. i was right; the interface is very different from motorola or htc. i think of myself as tech savvy, but the phone had little logic in the design of the menu's or locations for any of it's 80 important settings. the camera rocks at 13mp with crystal clear pictures, as long as you use the flash .   the s-pen working on the "back" and "list" buttons was very nice but palming the pen to push the home button is tedious. the display is stunning and the "adapt" features on both the sound for headphones, and visuals are great. speaking of sound, if you like listening to music or watching videos, i suggest you pick up a decent pair of headphones with your order. the speaker is terrible, its distorted and very sharp on c and s sounds. while loud, it lacks clarity in its volume. additionally, the microphone is trash. i've had some one talk to me using my phone and the distortion is present here as well. if you talk on speaker a lot, as i do, this probably isn't for you. it, like every other phone i've purchased in the last 2 years, comes pre-installed with a ton of "instant disable" apps. (i would love to get the choice of what i want to store on my phone for a change.) it also functions poorly with the youtube and spotify apps i run. aside from this, there is also the voice activation. it turned on at its choice of awkward moments, calling and texting without my knowledge. this, more than any other reason, lead me to the decision to send it back and choose a different phone. i'm going to miss the s-pen and scrapbook but i think i can get over it. the samsung galaxy note 3 might be a great phone for some, but not for me. i wouldn't recommend it, but i won't say it was a bad phone. i like where they're going with this line but i'm going to stay away until they work out all those bugs .   good luck, and happy shopping :-). order this on amazon with a 2 year contract with verizon on monday got it on wednesday morning was shipped to my front door at around 9am. was very impress with their shipping. the phone itself cost me around 230ish in total with taxes and evrything. i love this phone is so big, fast and has so much more options in settings rather than the iphone. i choose to change from apple to android because yes apple is very fast but after a while like at the end of the year my iphone 4 started to get very slow and not respond as much as when i first bought it. now i'm just trying to compare but so far my note 3 is great! of course i have to be extra careful because it is a really big phone and can easily be drop if not grabbed correctly .   this phone/tablet is wonderful. i no longer need to bring my kindle tablet with me; when waiting in a long line at costco, i just get my note 3 out and read. it does everything far more than i need .   better than iphone hands down .   absolutely love this phone! its like a pda, a bb, and an android got together and made whoopee! love it .   previously had the galaxy note & was considering on upgrading to note 2, but after seeing the note 3 knew it was the best choice. it is lightweight & very comfortable in my hand. the screen clarity, size & color is superb. i work in the medical field & use it constantly all day long, as well as tracking my fitbit information. the pre-installed samsung apps very useful. syncs & updates easily. this smartphone is the absolute best phone i've ever owned .  worth every penny i paid .   i am so glad i waited for this phone instead of jumping onto the s4. the display is phenomenal, the s pen is an awesome tool. i held onto my droid bionic for longer than i wanted to, because i just wasn't that excited about the phones that were available. having the unlimited data from vzw still, i knew i'd be paying retail price to keep my data plan and wanted to make sure i waited for the right phone. samsung did a great job, and i personally am glad they did not jump the screen up to 6 inches for the note 3. the display size is perfect, but any larger would be too big for a phone. i waited to see how htc's one max would turn out. i liked it's aluminum build, but for me, it just didn't have enough to challenge the note 3. thus, i went with my first samsung phone. it's fast, feature loaded, and i have a lot of fun with it. best of all, amazon price matched the phone to verizon's website price, so i saved $100 and was able to use an amazon.com gift card i had saved. very glad i made this purchase with amazon .   this phone (phablet), in reality, should get a 5. the screen is absolutely fantastic. the device, though large, feels great in hand. the stylus, with the quick actions that launch automatically and also when you push the button (and air gestures) works very well. the phone's battery life is unreal. i got easily 2 days worth fo use without charging, and a solid day of heavy usage. and the sd card slot is so underrated these days, as well as the removable battery. the "leather" back didn't look or feel cheap to me. and the phone turns a lot of heads, fid that's your thing. it's definitely a step up from the note 2. okay, so why didn't i give this phone a 5, or even a 4? according to the rating guideline, a 5 is "i love it," a 4 is "i like it." well i liked it at first, but never loved it. but over the course of a week i ended up not really liking it. i tried to give myself time to get used to the interface and it never happened. i changed the launcher, tried to tweak the settings, even tried some themes. ultimately it came down to the user interface is just awful. the colors are not consistent between the different apps and settings. the samsung touchwiz software and verizon stuff get in your way more than they help. coming from a galaxy nexus, the ui was just jarring to me. i didn't care for the hard buttons either, although that's just a preference. the way the samsung framework is set up, there's no easy way to enable on screen keys either. overall i was just not happy with the ui and the ux. also, the screen ppi settings are wrong for a screen of this size. everything is "too big." samsung could have tweaked it down a bit to make use of the 1920x1080 screen. as it is, you don;t really get any more usable room in apps than you would in a galaxy note 2. the only places you'll really see the screen shine with pictures, games, web and video. for me anyway, all other apps seemed to be overblown because the ppi settings are wrong. so i gave it a 3, because overall i think "it's okay." i ended up getting an lg g2. i like that phone a lot better. the lg user interface is more customizable and doesn't remind you of old android, but more in line with the new android 4.x user interface. plus, the g2 is capable of being flashed with cyanogenmod, if that's your thing. unlike the note 3, you don;t have to give up the stylus to do that. other features like air gestures, eye tracking etc are just gimmicks to me anyway .   great phone with great features and great display. lighter than i thought and with the case i got, the weight is just perfect .   the best smart phone i ever had. battery is fantastic. i am a real estate agent and i use my smart phone for business purpose. i can't even use half of my battery even in long day of work. just love this phone .   a great phone with tons of functions. i've owned apple and htc products, and the note 3 blows them all away .   great phone! it has not had a single problem. it's so quick and has such awesome features. i even talked 4 of my family members into buying this phone and they love it as well. so flippin' cool. i love this phone, i exchanged my note 2 with note 3, shipping so fast, ive using it for the past 3 days, im in love with this phone .   super fast, beautiful screen, battery pretty good .   one this is the magazine sometimes freezes the phone but you can disable it from the magazine settings. love amazon peace. this phone is literally the best phone i've ever owned. samsung really hit it out of the park with this one! the screen in absolutely amazing. beautiful, bright, and bold! this phone is so fast! that snapdragon 800 really brings its a game. everything is buttery smooth and i love it. this phone is a powerhouse and i can barely put it down. it feels great in the hand. though the screen is bigger, this phone is thinner and lighter than the note 2. i really didn't think i could love a phone more than my beloved note 2, but i was wrong! full hd 1080p takes things to another level. i paid full price for the phone and it was worth every penny. samsung has won a new fan .   yes it did meet my expectations very much, .   bought for a friend and he is thinking of ordering another one. :) i. good phone thanks. phone was received in good condition and works fine .   don't buy a verizon galaxy note 3 even if it is unlocked. other carriers will be good. verizon specifically has locked the boot loader so you cannot upgrade the operating system unless you are lucky and they did not update to version 5.0 or something. don't take the risk! i got this phone so i could run a better operating system and keep it running for years to come at better speeds than the new ones. looks like that won't be happening. if you do not plan on rooting/jail breaking the phone and getting a new operating system you will not have to worry about this. also, the chrome plastic rim on this phone chips very easily. mine barely has any left now and i have never dropped it. i do not use a cover so regular wear and tear of putting it in my pocket and pulling it out etc have worn it away somehow. the phone is fast, responsive, and a great platform. i am just bummed that i wasn't aware of the verizon issue with these phones. if you want to upgrade the os, stick to any other carrier. stay far far away from verizon .   great product. have yet to check if it's unlocked yet but it's working with my at&t sim card and it comes with android 5.0. everything is in it's original packaging like you would see if you purchased this cell phone new from a retail store .   too much dent on the phone. i try to buy this phone for my friend who live over sea later on i find out that this phone is not international version maybe it won't work over sea i would try another one later on .   returned phone i could hear people talking but no one could hear me unless i put the phone on speaker. i've ordered another one hoping the next one will work properly. update: i received another phone i would like to say this phone is working properly and cosmetics wise it looks like a brand new phone i am very happy with my purchase so far .   loved the phone! customer service was amazing too .   i like it, it is like brand new .   the camera sensor came in messed up. alot of these refurb phones are not fixed properly .   i know other peeps will have their own opinion but in my experience this is one of if not the best piece of computing hardware and software devices ever as far as phones go. the possibilities are endless with this thing. samsung is knocking it outta the park every time they step up to bat. the note series of phones are the best phones ever put on the market by far and i expect will continue to blow away the competition by very wide margins. do yourself a favor and throw that piece of i-crap in the garbage and get a real phone .   i tried ordering a case to go with the phone but you had old info on a lost credit card so every thing got messed up. i tried to correct the problem but never got the case. my phone is very cool and i like it alot, i'm mr mullan .   i love it. look like new. thanks. the home button did act up for a week where it stopped working for reason and then started up again. for no reason. a good phone. came with a few minor scratches but the phone overall did what it was meant to. i didn't have a single scratch on the screen but had some chipped paint on the sides. the price was pretty amazing for the product though .   love the phone, stylus, and features. it's a note 3, nothing old about it. still keeps up with other new phones in the market. was in immaculate condition almost new. i sketch/draw a lot, so the wacom digitizer was the biggest feature for me .   awesome! boyfriend loves it .   nice phone terrible presentation. worst refurbished presentation ever. no box, no headset, no original charger is just the worst experience i ever had .   i love it. many features did not work on straight talk and pictures are always upside down. okay for the price. phone was in good condition and is as represented by seller. i did my homework too about the types of phone operating systems that would work on straight talk .   good phone, but i actually like the prior generation more it feels more like a phone/tablet and has a wider screen , but this phone is good and more convent to carry around. my phone was sold by "cellular gallery inc," so i can't speak for anyone else. bought a used note 3 in perfect cosmetic condition. updated it to android 5.0 without any problems. the phone came earlier than expected, but wasn't delivered because it was a different mail carrier. like all phones, it immediately went into a case with a screen protector. it won't see the air unless something goes wrong. fingers crossed. if i run into any problems, i'll update this review, but hey, 5 stars for sure .   i orderd it for someone she have not given me her view about it , so i assume its ok .   defective. gps stopped working a few days after i could not return it .   great device great price. s galaxy note3 presently working excelllent. i loved it ! it works perfect with t mobile, i recommend it .   works great! easy to use, perfect for personal or business related things. this is the second one i've bought .   good deal. love the product. very nice. excellent and on time .   the vendor first sent unlocked att network phone. i use tmobile. i could make calls but it keep reseting to att. i contacted vendor told him what happen and without hesitation he sent me a tmobile galaxy note. there is clearly something dysfunctional with the phone i received. i can not turn on wi-fi. i do not mean that i can't connect to a wi-fi network, but rather that i can't even turn on the wi-fi switch. when i attempt to slide to switch from "off" to "on" it remains grayed out and then automatically switches back to "off" .   phone was actually pretty good but i developed a problem with the antenna while under warranty. samsung support is terrible. if support is important to you avoid samsung as their reps simply do not take ownership of problems .   this phone is great. work as expected. am still learning how to use it for professional use .   works great received the item 5 days early thanks happy camper . note 3 still i think one of the best phones out in the market. the samsung note 3 was advertised as new. i received a used samsung note 3 phone. in a torn at&t box .   phone arrived much sooner than expected, which made me a happy camper! i love this phone. all i had to do was insert my sim card and my sd card and pop the battery in and away i was! this is the best phone i've had yet .   pretty good condition, need to get a new s pen though, mine is malfunctioning alot. besides that you get whats expected, and shipping was pretty fast too .   great .   works great, but seems to forget my custom settings randomly. it has a good sized hd, has good speed, and has a splendid camera .   perfect phone, looked new, works great, is everything i wanted it to be. it arrived early. great deal. phone is in good shape for being almost three years old. the screen has no scratches at all, the housing has a small dent on one corner. it works fine on the family mobile network even though it is branded at&t. good phone at a good price. would order from the seller again. i love it. wow everything was mint as described. thank you .   perfectly described! the only thing wrong with it, was there was a couple dings on the corner of the phone. works perfectly fine and used it with the straight talk bring your own phone package. exactly what i wanted. it even came in before the delivery date! thank you .   great shape. samsung installed a lot of bloatware, some of which is only in korean. switched to syanogen .   i absolutely love my cellphone .   it's so easy to understand and use. the camera is fantastic! the only thing i'll say is it's super skinny u must have a durable case to not hurt it! it's fast and web browsing is so easy to save all ur fav sites! buy it bc it's so worth the price paid .   happy with the product. love it .   my daughter picked the phone out and she loves itâ™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡ thank you. as far as the product it was satifactory .   however, on the title it stated as unlocked. it wasn't unlocked and therefore i had to pay about $40 extra to have it unlocked .   love it thanks. honestly , so happy with this purchase. thought the size of the phone would bother me, but after using it for a while i just got used to it. its such an amazing phone & it came right on the date it stated. excellent purchase .   work great. excellent. great phone .   excellent phone! i don't have problem i love :). been using since june of 2015 and its absolutely fantastic. for the money you spend its worth its value .   wide screen, able to use it in india as well with 4g, sleek and completely fits it description. gps does not work properly. great phone. phone came just as advertised and looked great .   very happy with the product and it worked right out of the box in another country. i can easily recommend this compay .   malo. this phone was purchased for my son. he is extremely pleased and loves the large size. the more i look at it, the more i wonder if i shouldn't get one as well.  .   good and working great .   all functions are working. it looks good as promised. i'm having one issue with transferring data to pc. i seem to have solved that by changing a setting in the windows usb driver for the galaxy. but still testing to ensure it continues to work .   product good. perfect .  100% satisfied. way better than i expected. phone is in perfect condition and works with my carrier as promised .   this transaction went smoothly. i am satisfied. thanks. love it. i'm very impressed. it was delivered fast and have not had any issues .   there's a point where products like the note 3 and the note 4 are not really different. design is almost the same, performance and screen quality, even battery life are really similar. so i decided to go with the note 3 obviously thinking also in the price difference. there was really the big difference between de devices. don't get me wrong, i am a tech fan, i appreciate the little details, but thinking about functionality, for me, there was no big differences between this two .   the phone is good. no defects, and seems to be in great shape. only problem i see is that the wrong charger was sent with the phone. the charger works, but takes a good 10 hours to completely charge the phone. if a factory charger had been sent, it would have changed within 3 hours. that is my only issue with what i received with this product .   great phone so far .   it's all that and more very good phone .   i love my phone thank you .from now i shop from this store they have really good quality the phone is great just the adapter is not originall but it's ok i like it .thank you again. great products .   the product is above my expectations .  very clean no scratches .   was unlocked as stated. seller has excellent communication when i had queries. by far an overall good experience. just what i needed .   i was a note2 user for many years. ordered this note3 for an replacement upgrade. this phone works really well with very fast data rate with lte service .   my husband had if for 4 mo the and the screen doesn't work not happy. i'm a big fan of the features. however, if i put the phone in my pocket upside down, it will randomly restart. from what i have read, this could be an sd card or sim card issue. but i'd rather sacrifice my convenience to hold onto the phone and stay connected .   great at&t replacement .   i really like my samsung galaxy note 3, my new phone is fast a lot of properties you can do lot of things its fantastic looks like note 4 the camera is great .   i love this phone it is the best phone that i have so far. i love using air command and the s-pen. great, great phone. it came unlocked just like it said and i did not have any problems setting it up with t-mobile. i am glad i got it .   perfect. that was perfect. tank you very much i like the phone. i thought the phone was a virgin mobile phone, but it was at & t. their plans were very pricey, so i returned the phone .   it was not unlocked as describe and it could not be unlocked because the imei number was missing so i could not get it unlocked. i had to send it back for a refund. the phone was ok apart from this .   this phone arrived in excellent condition and has been a great phone all around. i love the big screen and am surprised at how well it fits into my ladies' size pockets. don't think i could ever go back to a smaller screen .   was very good. i can't buy a micro sim card for it anywhere. the pinnacle of phones .   phone is awesome. the hotspot functionality is not working with tmobile network. it seems to be a problem when they unlock the phone. i tried to contact the seller and waiting for his response .   excellent everything thankful. i'm satisfied with this item. the charger works great with my note 3. seller did a great job of it to me quickly. had to root and customize it to get it to work properly on tmobile but no biggie .   pick this up from warehouse deals in like new condition. this replaced a note 1. this phone works superbly, has a great screen, and i was able to set it up on the att gophone plan without a hitch. 4g lte, very good coverage in my area (about an hour from atl.), numerous features, no lag, very happy with this phone! it should last me a good year and a half, even though it has already been out for a year or more. great phone .   i liked the phone until i took it to the att store and found out the sim card is not responding to the att service. the rep at the store put in a new sim card and called my phone and it didn't ring at all but clearly rang on his phone. for everyone who purchases a product on line, please make sure you take it to the appropriate store to get it checked out to make sure it is working properly before the 14 day return policy expires. my phone would ring a couple of notes and then go silent but continue as though it was still ringing. i wouldn't hear the notes or they wouldn't play at all and it went to voice mail and then made a ding to let me know i had a voice mail waiting. also, when i would call out, the phone would show dialing for about 30 seconds and then hang up. this didn't happen all the time but enough for me to call the att service department who then directed me to go to the att store because it was the phone itself, not anything on their end. i didn't have issues with my old pre-paid att phone that was less advanced than this one so i have to go back to it for now. i have no problems with anyone, this phone just happened to be the one that had some issues. i know things happen .   is good. very reliable phone. i would highly recommend it .   great fone. nice & light. but i can't get the touchwiz home pop-up to go away. i ordered my galaxy note 3 after using my galaxy note 2 for 2 years, it is working amazing. very pleased about the upgrade and about quality of the phone. i got also a very secure hard case because in the previous one the case was very slim and it did not protected it well .   wow what can i say. i got this phone to replace my galaxy 3. when it arrived i could not believe my eyes. the phone looked better than bran new, not a scratch or neck anywhere. activated the phone on 05/15/15, after 10 to 15 minutes of uses the phone would go blank or black,and the screen would freeze. tried every thing to fix. look good, bad phone. excellent. bought used and came in perfect condition .  i love it .  i had to manually configure apn settings to get my lte for t-mobile to work .   yay a phone that works .   best phone i have every ownd. meets all my expectations so far. great buy. i would of given it 5 stars because its a greattt phone but when i opened the box it had no headset and the picture specifically shows that it was coming withâ one, but other than that the phone is great no problems whatsoever, i'll be purchasing 2 more .   great phone. came as promised, brand new in box with all accessories, and unlocked .   it's great. good. great phone. still learning how to to use all the wonderful features .   everything was good .   purchased on may 23. 2015 came on may 25, 2015. phone works great. bought from open group wireless, new unlocked samsung galaxy note 3. has good battery life. use on straight talk. use my own sim card .   love it .   love, love, love my new note 3 phone. works great plus a good price .  just so happy .   exellent. i love this phone period .   it works very good happy happy. received my new galaxy note 3. i love it a lot was not sure how to turn my data on had to go to the networks from my settings. i also only received the phone and the instructions. thankfully i have a charger that will fit my phone. 4 stars from me .   this phone is just amazing .   the box wasn't totally sealed and i thought its not new but it was a brand new. i love the phone and its highly recommended .   i love it. don't make a false commercial, i bought the phone because it had the samsung watch and the case; open the box and found only the phone so disappointed, great phone though .   the phone appearance great but having problem with some of the futures shipping was exact date. very satisfied. too big. love the display size. with a sturdy drop-protecting case, it is heavier and bulkier than the usual small phone but it is well worth having a phone that can double as a tablet. easy to use. love the camera. works well on my consumer cellular service (which uses the at&t network). did have to make a few calls and experiment a little to get the right apn settings but once that was resolved, it works perfectly .   fast, great shape, thank you .   best phone ever! i would recommend anyone who is having second thoughts to buy this phone without hesitation. you won't be disappointed the samsung galaxy note 3 rise beyond my expectations .   wow is all i can say .   almost half the price as buying it from a store. works great with net10. haven't had any problems .   it work perfectly fine with at&t. i also have no problem with the 4glte. love! love! love this phone.dose not come with manual or ear buds .   loving the phone .   this was used and i was a little hesitant to purchase it. i am glad i did .   it was well packaged. got here in great time. and was well taken care of! i love the size and ease of use .   i love samsung .   great phone .   work perfectly and fast. wonderful phone sometime it freeze up. wish i knew that i could buy insurance on amazon to protect my investment .   i am satisfied.  .   delivery was very fast, great phone .   great phone. phone is awesome.  .   my phone did not come with head phones .   great deal .   item arrived in excellent condition! i have been very pleased with this product and it actually arrived a day earlier than expected! :-). very nice phone. cons: some of the functions don't work due to being blocked by att apps. lots of bloatware. a little bulky pros: very fast 28g space for apps. no more juggling apps due to lack of space. all functions can be made to work with workarounds found by googling them. am getting used to the bulkiness of the phone and the big screen size is great for reading and surfing the net. overall very happy with the phone. i get 4g on my network .   best phone ever .   so easy to use and being 57 years old that's saying a lot. also easy to type as i have xl hands. so glad my old phone died .   the bezel siding came very scratched up .   thanks so far so good. the note three was great looking. delivery was very fast. i would recommend for anyone. great seller .   i ordered two unlocked at&t galaxy note 3 devices. one for me and one for my husband. definitely worth it. i was able to enter all the info and compatible sim cards to transfer these to net10 no contract phones. everything worked (internet, sms messages, texts .   ) on both phones. this is the best upgrade ever and very worthwhile. much faster than our old phones, plenty of case options on the internet, highly customizable, and finally a big enough screen to read on. i use mine to do my college internet assignments on and i love that i can annotate by hand with the s-pen. shipped fast, was in the original box like promised, pristine condition on both (though you could clearly tell they'd been opened before). had an extra item that i'd asked be included special, that was missing but when i contacted the seller they responded fast and got the requested item, that they'd originally agreed to send, sent to me very fast and at no extra cost .   great phone and it works with metro pcs too .   very happy with the phone .   best phone i owned .  very happy with this one. very satisfied, if i didn't know better i would have thought it was brand new. works perfectly and it was just as described .   the best ever .   works perfectly! fast and full of features, beautiful resolution and i love the abundance of memory space, i have a 32 gig sd card added so i'm never low on memory .   i give it an outstanding across the board. great phone but i tried it with at&t an it didn't work, had 2 get another phone instead .   all expectations were met with this phone. i love the notes, but must have had the international version i bought from walmart it was aweful. bought this from amazon as always amazon rocks. thanks amazon as always. great phone. exactly what i needed for work and leisure. (not too big. not too small and has a stylus) it was unlocked, so i was able to use a sim card from a network provider in a different country. just ensure the network frequency matches that of the phone .   arrived on time. works great .   upgraded from an galaxy s2. screen has alot of real estate. very fast, some very cool features even though you wont use all of them. s-pen is great for people on the run and need to keep quick notes or can be used as note pad as well. when using transcribe i dont have best handwriting and interpret s my text well. would recommend. not apple bashing but does stuff an iphone cant .   great phone love it .   exactly what i expected. great phone! super fast. great color. son loves this phone. great price for a non contract phone compared to what they charge at the phone stores. was advised to get new sd card for every new phone for if to run at its best. so runs perfect .   good value compared to note 4 that i seriously considered buying .   everything that i could ask for and expect .   i bought it for my 18 year old son, he loves it! it was a major upgrade from what his dad had bought for him years ago and would not let him upgrade. we would like to get a screen protector and a case for it and we can't find them on the rack anywhere, do you have the ones that would fit .   replaced my last note 3 that was stolen- still love it .   love it  .   just what was advertise. works great in good condition .   samsung note 3 - 2016 nov reviewed when it was launched i was not fond of it , but later it started growing over me, when compared to the competitor in the market its a beast of spec the day i bought, even today its a descent spec having 3 gb ram with quad-core 2.3 ghz krait 400 (snapdragon 805) i have reviewed my samsung note 3 att sm n900a model ,all below is the practical experiences. personnel exp : one time i went in to the swimming pool with my note 3 in my pant pocket and forgot to take it out , i realized after 25 minutes omg my phone with me under water , but good thing i had the knowledge in reviving it back , i didn't switch it on , just took it out let it dry out for some 15 to 20 minutes then kept in the rice jar for 3 days , after that it worked as a charm. of course i did have some loud speaker sound cut off some times. i have ordered by use of every individual person daily tasks in practicality of my view, build, call quality , camera , battery, screen and processor build - it has a great build quality and withstands drops. camera - 16 mp camera , using the camera360 app which makes the photos to live and meet your recent phone expectations, 4k videos are awesome in this set , it still a great camera , front camera is ok kind and good enough for skype or any other video calls. battery - i do feel a battery drain due to the android 6 , also its been 3 years may be need to change the battery. s health - does work a great in keeping my steps and other health stuff in shape. call quality is great and clear sound , ringing sound is great. screen- as it had a gorilla glass 3 5.7 inch amoled screen ,awesome color reproduction to live as i didn't have a scratch guard , yes it has some visible scratches, but gorilla glass concept is like when you switch on the screen , you wont find the scratches visible and neither disturbs your visibility of the phone. in recent phones its a lot more improvised software & processor - quad-core 2.3 ghz krait 400 with 3gb ram , it has great processing speed even today it supports all apps with breeze and games are great in it , i still miss the quad display which i have it in the samsung note 4(note 4 review i have posted separate ). one thing i miss is samsung is poor in giving software updates that too under att ,common it has a great configuration but still running in android 5.0, poor support , which apple is great in this department. but yes i have rooted and installed android 6, it works as a charm s-pen - practically speaking i used it initially then i didn't take it out often, just some times if some one says phone number , address , i wont say you can buy the s series instead of note 3 as this unit has some great performance compared to the s series .   this used samsung galaxy note 3 was a replacement for one currently owned. after setting up the phone it did not work. it drops calls, drops wifi connection, and the home button barely works. this is not a usable phone. also, the screen is clearly a replacement and not the original because it is so thin. i am not happy with this product .   flawless .  looked brand new .  no issues. very satisfied. love this phone. huge screen and great graphics. this phone appeals to the android user who likes to pinterest, facebook and watch their netflix! i'd give it 5 stars but i'm a bit bummed by the lower standard of stylus pen, ability to remove it from it's little slot and it's lack of on-screen sensitivity in comparison to its predecessors. programming is great! works similarly to the older note versions but still has adequate improvements .   wish it had come with a charger for $150 it should have come with a charge most phones do when you buy one very strange. works great. great phone, shipped timely .   big screen, reliable, good battery, love the stylus, lasts very long. product was in amazing condition thank you so much .   the phone came in great working condition .   i bought this phone as a phone upgrade for my youngest daughter. i don't recall which was the seller listed on the actual amazon search listing, but as almost always when looking for a "certified reconditioned" phone, the one listing had multiple sellers. the listing returned by my search said "unlocked phone, works with any gsm carrier"; but when i clicked through to the seller list, that listed seller's description also listed the quality as "used/acceptable", then described what sounded more like "badly abused". so i picked the seller listing for edge cellular, who listed their phone as "used/very good", which i completely agree with. this phone looks like new. the one problem is, amazon *didn't tell me* or give me the opportunity to see that edge cellular's original listing stated the phone edge was selling was locked to at&t's network. nevertheless, edge is going the extra mile to try to get me an unlock code for the phone. so, kudos to edge cellular. it's going the extra mile like this that brings customers back for future purchases. i wish amazon made it easier to see differences between individual item listings when it compresses multiple sellers into one listing for an item. this problem was not edge's fault, but they're trying to fix it anyway. the truth is, amazon created the problem here, not edge. this kind of multi-seller listing works fine for, say, a kitchen utensil or a book or a laptop computer â€” but problems arise when amazon does it with smart phones and mixes locked and unlocked phones together in the same listing, without warning the shopper that some of the phones may be locked. on to the phone itself: i originally bought myself a galaxy note 3 to replace my droid 3 because it was the largest screen i could get in an actual phone. i haven't regretted the decision. the note 3 has a brilliant, bright, vivid, pin-sharp full-1080p screen with great color saturation and dense, rich blacks. its eight-core exynos processor does the magic balancing act of being fast when performance is needed, but energy-efficient when battery life is needed, by having four high-performance cores and four high-energy-efficiency cores and switching back and forth between them as needed. it's a brilliantly inspired design. backed up with 3gb of ram and a huge user-replaceable battery, it means a fast, well-performing phone that will go as much as two days on a battery charge. samsung's own chargers will fully charge the phone in a couple of hours. the galaxy note 3's large screen makes it easy to use, but if you find yourself needing a little more precision or you want to scribble down some notes in a hurry, the s pen stylus comes in as a killer feature. i wasn't convinced about the stylus at first, but once i started using it, i realized that for many uses, it is nearly indispensable, making the phone much more useful. and for all this, it'll still fit in your pocket. (unless you're a woman and have to deal with those silly shallow fake pockets that fashion designers love to inflict upon women, that are just about big enough to hold your car keys or a handful of loose change.) sound quality as a phone, to be honest, is not great. but, to be honest, i've yet to try any "smart phone" that i actually thought was a decent phone. they all share atrocious audio clarity compared to a landline or voip phone. part of this is a simple matter of hyper-aggressive voice compression codecs trying to fit more calls into the same amount of bandwidth; part of it is simply a matter of necessarily-tiny speakers and microphones. i've found that the best two ways to clearly hear a call on the galaxy note 3 are either to turn on speakerphone mode and then hold it as if it were in regular phone mode, or used a wired â€” not bluetooth â€” headset. (i have a skullcandy titan headset that is fantastic, but the titan has been discontinued for several years now. i don't know what i'll replace mine with when this one eventually breaks.) and even at that, the experience in this household is that while all smartphones have terrible voice audio clarity, samsung phones tend to be better/clearer than many others. however, nobody buys modern smartphones because they're great phones. (they're not.) people buy modern smartphones because they're great pdas. (or aid, or handbrain, or fondleslab; insert your favorite euphemism here.) and as a pda, the galaxy note 3 was the best on the market when it hit the market, and hasn't gotten any worse since. other large-screen phones exist now that compete with the galaxy notes, and later galaxy note models have arguably raised the bar further still, but the stylus is still a samsung exclusive feature shared by no other phablet that i am aware of. the one real drawback of this phone is that the only way you're ever going to get an android os newer than 5.0 (lollipop) on it is to root it, unlock the bootloader, and install cyanogenmod. however, even if samsung did offer android 6.0 (marshmallow) or newer for this phone, which they don't, you'd probably want to go the cyanogen route anyway, because on devices for which they do offer marshmallow, samsung decided to cripple it by disabling adoptable storage, possibly the single most important-to-the-end-user feature of marshmallow after its up-to-30% energy-efficiency improvements. (you see, samsung decided that you don't want it, so they chose not to give you the choice of whether to use it or not. that low rumble you can hear in the background is the sound of hundreds of thousands of technically-aware samsung users grinding their teeth in rage.) so, there you have it: great phablet, limited android upgrade future unless you're prepared to root it and install cyanogen, and be very wary of amazon mixing locked and unlocked phones on the seller list for the same listing .   this device was supposed to ship with jellybean or kitkat as it was shipped in 2014, mine arrived with lollipop (android 5.0 with critical stagefright vulnerabilities) so obviously opened and resealed, which does not work for me. i will be returning it asap .   awesome. this phone continually drops calls arbitrarily without cause (not just in drop zones) but in the middle of conversations every single day and it's not the carrier because i've had other phones with the same carrier and they did not do that. i am very disappointed with this phone. love,fast shipping and great quality just as described .   love the phone and was a great condition when they said it wasn't as good. so thank you .   :-). like new great phone. this product although i requested it new was reported stole. need i say more .   very happy with my new samsung .   please be honest each other the phone hab arrived today and i open it see many things no perfect. i would like to return my refund as soon as possible when you get it. thanks seng vue. item was shipped very fast and phone looked exactly like it said it would .   other than the phone is pretty banged up on the edges, it seems to be working really well so far .   i love galaxy's phones .   ðÿ˜š. mms was not installed on phone. had to use a hotspot to connect to internet away from my home router .   yes but it does stay charged even if u'r not using it .   i love it. not satisfied with this purchase. the battery is completely bad. i fully charge the phone and it doesn't last 2 hours therefore i'm going to have to buy a new battery .   this phone sucks always says no service . i miss calls a lot because of it. i had lost an identical model. this replacement was in every way as satisfactory. i'm pleased to have it .   this phone has exceeded expectations .   got it for my son & he loves it, it is easy to operate & has excellent features, he installs security systems & this is the perfect phone for him. it is in excellent condition, like new & works great, have not had any problems at all. i was skeptical about it when ordered but very pleased with everything .   it's perfect, brand new and everything in the description. i the phone. it turns off by its self i'm just going to buy a new phone. i love this phone! simple and easy to use. especially like the "notepad" .   the phone was damaged it wooden charge but i was going on vacation so i took it it worked but slow charging wen i got back had to change the charging port it was damaged so now i just have to get it to mount the sd card that i haven't been able to do. dislike!  .   for some strange reason, my galaxy note 3 only works with my s pen now i have to send it back and go without a phone for good knows how long. why sell defective products .   i absolutely love it. it's nice to not have to enter into a next contract with at&t. it has so much memory, even with micro-sd card .   excellent. bought this 2 yrs. ago. still working well. after many drops, in its case, it is still my 1st choice for a smart phone. the camera could be better is all .   quick delivery, phone works great. thanks. love these phones we have four of them .   i absolutely love this phone .   the touch screen has quit working after two weeks and i haven't dropped it and have a protective case and screen protector. very disappointed .   had the phone for less then a week and now its not even charging not aure what to do has anyome eles had this problem. when i first got it my lock button kept getting stuck. and it was hard to lock my phone. and sometime it's slow or won't work. i don't like it and i won't be buying anything off of here or from you aging .   nothing .   the volume is too low. the battery life sucks .   the quality of pictures aren't clear. samsung didn't do a great job with this phone. i hate it .   if you only 300 dollars and you want a phone. this is what you should get .   i'm so in love. finally. i've been through the ringer with different phones from online and this on came prfect condition and so easy to use. great product. i am very pleased with my phone. said that it was in acceptable condition, but it was perfect. thank you. delivery came before expected date and phone was new as advertised .   loved it .   the size of that note is quite big i personally will not purchase this for myself but that's what my daughter want and she likes it the features are working fine let's see how long it will last  .   the phone works and it is a great phone but the proximity sensor is not working, i have to turn off the screen every time there is a call. i could have returned it but i really need a phone so basically i'm forcing myself on using this. hence the 2 stars otherwise it would have been a 1 star .   i bought a samsung note 3 the end of february. when i received product phone charger fit in charging port loosely but phone would charge. however now phone will not charge at all. waste of money. love the phone but if it won't charge it is no good to anyone .   love it, many thanks .   screen freezes .  slow at,times opening pictures. great phone. horrible phone doesn't even turn on and way worse condition than stated. now phone just sits here and money wasted .   this is used and it has scratch. also broken little bit on the edge of the phone .   this went above and beyond my expectations everything was perfect look like a brand new phone . came in original box and all the chargers samsung as well. and the people were very very helpful .   phone couldve been, the digitiser looks funny, but overall great condition. i was very skeptic when i bought this in "like new" condition. when it arrived however i must say it is in brand new condition. no scratches on the case or screen. the phone operates perfectly. was in chinese so had to change to english. it came with a generic charger that has a low output amp but it does charge, just not as fast as the original. the cable says samsung, but it is a very tight fit into the phone. all in all the phone is what matters and i would buy it again even with out the charger. the price was low compared to other vendors with less than new condition .   i have greatly enjoyed using this phone .   bought this for my wife about 15 months ago and it's still working like new. she's never once had it in a case and has dropped it on several occasions and yet the screen still looks immaculate. i offered for her to upgrade her phone and she says she's still loving her note 3 and declined the offer .   i absolutely love this phone. it is everything i hoped it would be. i purchased mine refurbished from "cellular gallery inc." and they were great. i contacted them before buying the phone, and they were very helpful. i received the phone in 4 days-- a week before it was supposed to arrive-- from the other side of the country. the phone is brand new looking-- no marks whatsoever, and it came in the original box. this phone is as fast as my pc-- i cannot believe how fast this thing is-- and it has so many awesome features that i don't even know where to begin. all i did was plug in my sim card from my old phone, and everything worked; i never had to go into the store. i am absolutely satisfied with this phone, and i would highly recommend it .   awesome .   great phone. the note 3 is almost as big as the iphone 6 plus. what drew me to this phone is the sd card, use the 32 gb cause the phone is only compatible with the 32 gb. the performance of note 3 is pretty ease to manage. there are many hidden feature that one can use such as swpe, multi widow, and the second pen .   great. love it .   the phone works really good, no problems. love it .   i got exactly what i had hoped for and the phone works amazingly .   great phone. great seller. unfortunately it got stolen mid august just 4 months after purchase. i purchased this as a replacement for my beloved note 3. my note 3 was soaked in a storm but, when i let it dry out, it worked perfectly. wow! so, amazon delivered a timely replacement but i never opened the box. if my original phone hadn't come back to life, amazon would have save the day for me. thank you .   battery runs down fast .   great phone. great shipping. highly recommended. phone shuts off and back on again. never again buying from seller. very disappointed .   one very happy customer. phone won't take screen shots. the phone is exactly how they showed it and exactly what i was looking for. the pen is amazing, and being both an aspiring game designer and love messing with animation, the pen lets me do my work on the go with a simple app download, love it. however, the only reason why i did not rate it with 5 stars, was because the battery was bad and it kept dying about half way through the day .   very satisfied customer .   love this phone .   i like it - it works just like new. however sometimes the volume (specifically in the alarm) doesnt go off, it will just vibrate even i have it on full but no biggie. once i restart it goes back on. :). the phone drops call, you will be the middle of a call from a doctor are friend and the phone shuts off .   i want to send back the phone it has a 30 day warranty i paid almost 190.00 for the phone. so how do i proceed to sending it back .   perfect. just like new .   it works great. and the packaging is phenomenal. love it. kind of heavy to be lugging around but it works great. fast shipping and very pleased with my purchase. arrived in perfect condition everything works as it should. phone was in great condition, just the keyboard app crashes after having it less then a month .   outstanding phone. looked new and works flawless. and fast shipping and well backed to keep from damage. thanks a lot for the great service .   i love it. amazing product. speedy delivery.a+++. this has been an excellent purchase. this phone has met and exceeded my expectations! the shipping was very fast. i received the phone a day earlier than estimated .   my husband loves it. phone just shuts off once it gets to about 30 percent most times it does not pop up with any warnings .   the batery came damaged i hace to charge it 2 r 3 times a day. thanks. the product was awesome. :). this phone is easy to use and has an abundance of programs that come with it. most of them i probably won't use. but the ease of use because of the size is exactly what i wanted .   product wasn't described well the phone is a lot more damage than expected .   i am very unhappy with this "refurbished" phone. every thing did work, but it looked like it was kept in a mechanics tool box before. it was the worst refurbished product i have ever got from amazon. numerous nicks and scratches on the edges. will have to reconsider buying refurbished products in the future .   great phone and very fast shipment .   great phone from what i saw for a small amount of time before it wouldn't hold a charge and shut off. going to just assume i was given a crappy battery or something. don't understand why the phone not only came not charged but was also not tested before it was shipped out? just really unprofessional and dissappointing .   my best buy from amazon to date .   this phone comes as exactly as described. works flawlessly and so far no kinks or problems! i came from having the blue 6" hd cell phone. i will never go back! there are so many options that i haven't even discovered yet! thank you for an amazing product at an affordable price .   great phone  .  gives apples iphone a run for its money  .   love it .   you said the phone was functional but it will not charge. i did a cold boot to the phone but that didn't help. i also replaced the charger but to no avail , its just not working .   came in great condition, bought it used, the cosmetic condition was great .   the phone is great i have used this phone since april and its still going strong. i have kept a otterbox on it since i took it out of the box. i wish i could have got the newer one but this one is great! camera isnt the best, i dont like how you cant take multiple pictures one after the other also they are blurry unless you are standing completely still. over all would recommend. a beautiful phone .   100% perfect condition. netral of opinion. condition as advertised. great phone .   this review is about buying this as a refurb phone from at&t. the functionality and features of the phone are fine, but the microphone failed within 4 months so the only way i can talk to people is via speakerphone. this phone doesn't carry a warranty so buyer beware. these phones are clearly not refurbished to last. if you buy a note 3 be sure to get a warranty .   awesome phone for being referbished i was worried on the quality but it exerted my expectations and shipping was fast and reliable. absolutely love it. easy to use and screen size makes texting the best l have ever had .   awesome phone, just has pitiful reception through at&t at my mother's house. . . who i bought the phone for, because my personal note 3 has exceptional reception .  usually. .  .   i already have this phone. i ordered it for my mother as a christmas gift. but when i ordered this phone it was described as like new and they described it as mint condition. but this phone has a nick on the silver around the screen towards the bottom right side. not to mention that when they say it comes with a generic charger and cable. they do not mean comparable to 3.0 data cable that originally comes with it. they send you one of the old micro usb chargers. but for the price i got it i am willing to accept these things. now lets talk about function. this phone has been a life saver to me. it is one of the best phablets you could want. it is never slow and keeps a great charge. i can even have the internet open and also open a smaller window with text messages or what ever you set for the pop-up window to allow. it also has a very long battery life. i am always at doctors appointments for my family and always playing games and it has enough juice to last the whole day. also if you have the 3.0 usb charger (like what comes with it right off) it charges super fast. so even if your one of those people like me that forgets to charge your phone the night before you can plug it in while you get ready in the morning and be good to go in about 15 to 30 mins .   thank you edge cellular! the seller was great the phone is as described but no dead pixels no crack screens a few nicks on the frame but otherwise flawless. already on 5.0 too very nice .   meets my expectations .   it is stuff on spanish and have to return it .   i've been putting off writing a review because there is so much more that this phone can do compared to my previous one (nokia lumia 635). i'm very satisfied with this purchase and it arrived much earlier than anticipated. i've yet to find anything to not be happy about .   best phone i ever had. with the att net flawless .   it was more than expected  .   it came in like 2 days .   very happy customer right here .   it's like brand new ! thank you .   i recieved a clean new looking and fully functional 32 gb note 3. its working fine so far. the only problem i have experienced with the phone is that 1 in every 50 times i use the camera a third of the screen goes black. resetting the phone usually fixes the problem. over all i think it is a good purchase .   love this. still love it. working perfectly .   i am loving my note 3 and i received it before the expected delivery date .   very pleased .   arrived on time. works perfectly .   company sent black instead of white. i kept it anyway. works as described. overall good experience .   the phone came in great condition, but i cannot use free wifi hotspots and phone blocks me from accessing important website. i never had these problems with my other note 3 .   received the next day ordered. everything works fine. it is amazing thank you so much to web host. the ad stated the note was looked to attt. well i took a chance popped my sim card in and it works jhat fine. had it for 7 months now still going strong, until i saw the note 5 lol. i love my new phone :). exactly as described. no problem turning on w/ att. thanks .   best phone that i own .   looks great like new .   the sound is a bit blown out but not too bad. nice smartphone. doesn't eat up the battery as quick as the s3. will last 5 days if i don't surf a lot .   it is fantastic the best phone i ever had .   worked as expected. i'm taking my time to become familiar with the stylus, but overall, i like the phone 100%. perfect. it was great  .   so this was the first phone i actually paid for out of my own money that wasn't directly on a contract and i really couldn't be happier with it. i was debating between this and the note 4 but after close examination of the specs the small upgrades are not worth the vast difference in price .   the phone was exactly as described. i do with i had gotten a usb 3.0 charger instead of the micro charger but other than that everything is great .   absolutely every but as good as a brand new phone. there wasn't a mark on it. i did consider knocking off a star because is didn't ship with a usb 3.0 cable, but regardless it's a great phone. i did also buy the zerolemon 10ah battery with a case this let's me really use the phone instead of crippling it to save battery .   good. very good  .   this phone is the perfect size for everything and i have never had anything including a camera that takes better pictures .   great phone! awesome deal! very prompt shipping! came with a wall and travel (usb) charger which i wasn't impressed with (travel charger smelled of fire and wall charger broke 2 days after i got it, but i have been more impressed with this phones quality that the charger issues didn't make me change my mind. love love love my phone and would definitely buy from this buyer again .   it is good so far. i did not use s pen. mostly i used my hand to scroll .   best phone ever .   i will never switch from samsung .   fast delivery .   i would recommend this product/seller to everybody! they answered any questions i had promptly .   upgraded from a note 2, great improvements however i'm not a fan of the latest update. camera is much better & the clarity on this phone is great. battery is average, but charges fairly quickly with the original oem charger .   i love android & samsung. but it breaks very easily. don't carry it in your pocket or drop it. it will shatter the glass. invest in a hard-shell cell phone case. i love this phone, i have large fingers and this phone has the largest display on the market .   got here quick and it works perfect. and no fake phone original samsung. great! needed it asap and it came faster than amazon expected shipping! love it .   i love my new phone! just got it yesterday and i'm so happy with it. thank you .   extremely happy with the note 3 phone, the speed of shipping and the at&t service. i received it in about 5 days. i ordered it on friday night and received it wednesday of the following week. this phone was advertised as very good condition. it was actually new. i don't think it had ever been used by anyone. it was still in the plastic bag and still had all the stickers on the telephone case. it arrived in the original samsung box. i took it to at&t and they activated it and it worked perfect. certainly is new. i have since order 6 more at&t note 3 and they are perfect. unbelievable price. you can't beat the price or service. greatest phone and camera ever. extremely satisfied .   very nice and good shipping. i bought this for my gf she was a iphone fan and she loves the note 3 better than the iphone. the battery on the iphone would die super fast but the note 3 battery lastest forever love this product i would recommend it to everyone that has an iphone to switch to android .   great. just few months and it stopped charging. its dead completely and i have no clue how to start it now. amazon's return policy is within 3 months .  can i contact at&t? very bad experience .   phone after google lollipop was great, lag very minimal. phone just performed and looked much better. the phone it self came with some dings can be easily covered up with a case, i didn't i like my to use my phones with out cases. the phones screen was perfect only one hair line scratch. battery life great after update. solid performer, just keep in mind if you buy, you are getting a used phone again used phone .   i have only had this phone a few days but so far i am truly satisfied .   it was excellent. well my phone arrived with a flaw. there was an annoying line at the top of my screen where there was something wrong with the display. actually 2. the touchscreen also was messed up. you had to press a few times to get it to do anything. the seller did not have another to replace with for about 2 weeks. by that time i was completely done with dealing with the back and forth between the seller about an exchange and being without a phone. i was finally completely done and just sent it back and had to wait for a refund .   wanted the note 4 at first. then i did my research about the note 3 vs. note 4. choose the note 3. saved quite a bit of money by choosing last year's tech .   very good phone, love the size and the brand. the phone is fun to play with. however, it froze several times and i had to turn off the phone. also, the charger did not work after less than 5 months. had to buy a new one. does it have one year warranty .   for every samsung phone, it won't last for more than a year .   awesome phone, just like new .   package arrived on time and as expected. i've had no issues with my new (used) phone. in fact, i'm typing this review on it. thanks for the great phone; you saved me from having to do at&t's horrid next program .   the phone was locked but owner stated it was unlocked. it was like new and i'm really happy about it. great product better then i expected great price. excellent. i love this phone and i'm still using it. love my note3 had been wanting one for so long .   best smartphone i have ever used, a+. love all of the new s-pen features, i use s-note regularly for just jotting down some quick notes during class or for reminding me my safe combos when i play online game called dayz .   excellent phone, i love it. i love my phone. i haven't had any concerns so far. this company gets a 5star rating. i love my phone .   this is the second phone i've purchased from amazon. as with my previous phone, this came in new, pristine condition. i had absolutely no problem purchasing or installing the phone. very happy .   i am not quite impressed with this samsung galaxy note 3,it has been so much problem charging the phone, i took it to a repair shop and i was told that the charging port needs to be replaced. i really needed a phone otherwise i thought about returning it. you should have indicated that this was an issue so i will know exactly what i was buying .   i have been using the device for a while now. the four stars is for the fact that i purchased a used device. i have not had any issues with it. works great .   good. my wife loves her new phone. looks better than described .   awesome phone! now waiting for expiration of my 2-year contract to upgrade to galaxy 4 .   hubby uses this phone. the stylus broke so that's annoying but other than that hubby very happy with it .   love my note 3! have had no problems at all! i dropped it a few times with cover on and no problem. i dropped it once without the cover had a small crack appear. the good thing is when you look at it head on you can't see the crack! so it doesn't bother me. needless to say keep a covet on it. makes it a little more bulky .  but isn't it worth it .   good buy. the scratches and dents were not too much and the screen was completely ok. i recommend to buy from the seller .   great price and very happy with the shipment .   increased my productivity two fold .  many thanks for the nice discount .  aloha .   i received a mint condition galaxy note 3 with the original wall charger, cable, and battery. phone works flawlessly. no noticeable scratches or blemishes. i'd definitely buy a phone from this seller again .   nice. just what i want it, however, no head set included. a little disapointed .   good phone but not for those who is accustomed one handedly, screen is too big for that. it seems like it has the same features as the s4 but with a larger screen and pen .   great product. i will definitely shop with this seller again. the phone works great and looks great to. shipment was fast and arrived earlier than expected .   its a smart phone. its a smart phone. so many choices! this was the right one for me .   phone came without earbuds .   not satisfied. battery wears out in no time even if i don't use the phone. phone gets too much hot in charging within 15 minutes and shows message in phone that charging discontinued, battery is too hot. did not get headphone with it either .   my first note phone, i really like it so far, the screen looks amazing, the phone runs great. i haven't used the pen features much yet, and i am not sure how much i will but great phone overall. absolutely no touchwiz lag running this phone, i upgraded from a samsung galaxy s3 .   awesome phone and fast shipping .   the samsung galaxy note 3 i purchased is just perfect for me .   ok, so. i ordered my new phone, said be week and a half till i got it. ok. two days later i got my phone! now that's service! it does take the mini sim if you buy the transfer your phone package at walmart it has the card you need or i'm sure can order on here. i'm used to iphone so it's all new to me. but i'm having fun learning how to use it. sometimes at the expense of annoying my adult kids. but that's a plus to being a mom. now to decide weather to replace my tablet with a galaxy or back with an ipad. it is big! but that is what i wanted .   has better specs than the brand new iphone and it shows .   love it love it love it. my wife is still acclimating to a smart phone in general, but she likes it better than the htc one x i tried to buy for her a couple years ago. i say tried, because she made me take it back and get her another slider .   great tool for the multi-tasker! pen on the note 3 is much better than the note 2. would recommend to a good friend any day of the week. also, i seem to have fewer issues than some of my friends who own the other most popular devices .   the good: the phone runs smoothly and beastlyas it should. overall a great experience to be honest. good bang for the buck. saved a lot of money getting this phone. the phone was overall real except the battery wasn't. the phone didn't come with a 3.0 charger and it was hard to find a good working one online. same goes for the battery. i'm also wondering what was up with the boot up animation. it reveals a unlock logo that has the word "unlocked" under it. i'm guessing the phone was rooted? which kind of sucks i can't update this phone .   excellent phone. came fast, great phone but got a note 4 for the same price somewhere else. thanks though. love, love, love it .   good product for good price. great buy. i absolutely love my galaxy note 3. i especially love the stylus. the phone is very easy to use .   not happy with the defective phone or the phone service .   i love it! the item was as described! it had a few scratches around the sides from normal wear and tear, but that was expected buying it used. :). large display. easy to use. great for skype and other video communication .   two issues prevent 5 stars .   1) gps does just not work for me even now (+1 year) when using the at&t rom .   2) the knox application security combined with the at&t software just can't get along very well .   i can get to avoid the problems mostly, but i get prevention information box still from time to time at a rate just short of irritating enough to go see if i can 'fix' it .   exellent. great. love my phone. i love this phone. does everything as expected. perfect phone. the samsung galaxy note 3 is fantastic for a first time smart phone user. it has a clear large screen. it can be used as a e-reader. reading and sending email makes it very easy, with a good size keyboard. it has the best android apps. the only problem is that it also is preloaded with games and apps that i do not use. samsung recommends not removing certain apps .   great phone. i'm happy with it. a lil scuff on the top of the rim but the screen had no scratch .   i absolutely love my note 3 phone! it is awesome! just wish they made more selections of phone cases for it .   screen is perfect body is good but there's one problem with this one which i still decided to keep but now is getting on my nerves now that i'm getting it ready and testing it to give as a present in christmas december 2014 on arrival the home button was kind of fudged up and by kinda i mean it goes kinda dead like it gets stuck and gets hard to press pretty much cycling between stuck and hard to press every 2 out of 3 times you press the home button even when not tapping the home button during normal use like browsing facebook then home buttoning back out to go to another app you notice the hard button and the low crack sound coming from the phone itself now like i said the phone i'm talking about is going to be a gift but this is also the second phone i bought the first phone was damn perfect i mean damn perfect (except for dirt which could be cleaned and a dirty s pen which still can't be cleaned) but other than that everything was perfect with the first purchase but the second purchase just home button issues man and that's not good on a high end phone like this one even if it's used .   i am very pleased with this product .   great phone. best phone ever. i am amazed samsung is not leading the market in phones. my only regret is i was not able to get the note 4. but if, like me, you can't get the note 4 this is a great phone. the many things you can do with the stylus alone make it worth it. it is even a better phone than the 6 plus. it is versatile. i also got a galaxy gear to go with it. really why anyone would choose an iphone over this boggles my mind. samsung was the first to make phablets. apple even made fun of it .   love it .   great phone. grreatphone. got it from amazon warehouse used and the condition was as stated. my galaxy s3 was nearly ran into the ground and i wanted something a little bigger and faster. the 3gb of ram sold me over the gs5. also the 32gb of internal of storage was twice what the gs5 offered at the entry level. the price was right and i'm extremely pleased with the device. it still has 4 cores for processing so it's definitely fast enough to do what i want to do. i would highly recommend this to someone looking for a phablet .   i probably don't have enough words to describe my satisfaction with this purchase. this phone is the next love of my life after my wife. because of the bigger screen size you can practically do anything on this that you would do on a computer. i use it for everything from checking emails, train times, maps to booking flight tickets, online purchases, etc. i barely use my laptop these days. the battery life is pretty good depending on your use and runs longer than the previous samsung phones that i have seen. the best thing is that the phone charges from 0 to 100% in 2 hrs which is not bad for this size of a phone. the processing speed is very good with 3gb ram and 2.5hz processor. i run multiple apps at a time, like i talk to my wife while checking my emails, chatting on whats app and shopping on amazon. this is really a multipurpose phone. lastly, i understand that while i am writing this note 4 is already out and this review might seem outdated. but i saw note 4 after i bought this. there is not much difference between the two phones and note 4 is $250 more expensive. so if you don't want to spend that much on 4 you can go for note 3 and will find almost everything that a note 4 has to offer .   i'd give the phone a 5 but i have my worries now that i realized one of the buttons doesn't light up like it's supposed to. this leads me to believe that the screen may have been replaced. i have no proof so i cant say but it would've been nice if they mentioned that in the description. also the charger it came with doesnt work. fortunately i purchased another one prior to recieving the phone as a back up. overall the phone seems to work just as i imagined. i'll update this later on if i find any more problems .   moved from a galaxy s3 (which i loved) to this since i do predominantly work emails, reading, listening to music. with headphones these are perfect device for travelling and daily use! great battery life too .   it's cool i love it. it was recommended by a friend and i am enjoying it. still got some learning to do .   it was not listed as described. a black color note 3 was shipped to me. as a courtesy i have no further comments .   no complaints. i can work on writing papers and even spreadsheets on google drive with this without straining my eyes as much. it's so comfortable and helps my productivity. love that i can see upcoming events on the calendar, too. i wanted something smaller than a tablet (small enough to jog with) but larger than a phone. couldn't be happier .   cheap, plastic, crashing nothing but hyped marketing poor built machine .   down with iphones .   awesome purchase .   love it. love my note 3, looking forward to the note 5 next year .   easy to use stylus. s-note feature is a great tool. easy to make lists and keep up with things to do. large screen makes viewing websites and e-mails easy. i'm using the note 3 now instead of the kindle .   i love this phone .   i can actually read without straining my eyes and type without always hitting the wrong keys. a few features i haven't figured out yet, but i will. the stylus is such a great feature for writing quick notes and playing games with more accuracy. being able to flip back and forth between two windows has really been handy when you are talking with someone and need to look information up for them. only change i would like to see is when you hit the back key while in the internet that it actually logs you off the internet so it doesn't use up data. there may be a way to do this, but i haven't found it yet .   my wife loves this phone. she had the note 1 before and this was quite the upgrade. she never used the s pen notes before but with the new feature she uses it now. it is lightning fast and she can use it all day with out charging it. great product .   great phoneâ€¦ last even after i've dropped it a dozen timesâ€¦just keeps on workingâ€¦lots of features. replaced my phone. had worked 100% for some time now .    .   samsung galaxy note 3  .   how do i love thee?  .   let me count the ways. bigger, brighter screen. excellent apps. oh! and i don't have to jump through all those insane clown posse hoops that iphone creates to frustrate me. with sam sung's note 3 i simply drop them into my phone and bingo! it's done. i can listen to my music or gaze upon my photos with ease.  .  and speaking of photos!  .   i can place my phone back to back with my wife's note 3 and share photos and music in two shakes! one more thing, the galaxy note 3 has the usb 3 cable for faster charging and data loads. the galaxy 2 and galaxy 4 have the usb 2 cable (can you say slow-er?). there are so many ways i love thee that i could fill pages the size of a phone book. that said .   think i'll take my phone out dancing right now. ohhhhh  .  ohhhh!  .   just listen to the music  .   best phone i have ever owned .   best. smartphone. ever. when i upgrade cells i like to buy those that are the previous model. saves lots of money, the bugs are usually worked out, and there are lots of low cost peripherals like cases and screen protectors .   i love my phone .   best phone i've ever had .   better than expected, looks brand new, no scuffs. works well with strait talk. the price was right .   no problems so far .   love it. this way better then a first galaxy 1. the battery life is outstanding .   upgraded from an iphone. great move .   sound quality is awful! sounds like a broken speaker from the 90's. terrible for how much they want for this phone! everything else was perfect .   amazing phone, never been happier .   i love this phone. very fast, lots of memory .   very pleased with phone, screen protector and the projector, the case however was a big disappointment i guess i expected too much. as a previous iphone user, i was a little skeptical to make the switch over to an android device. the iphone was very user friendly and i was comfortable with it. however, i took a leap of faith and grabbed me a galaxy note 3. it is not much different in terms of being user friendly. it is much faster than my iphone ever was and the screen is huge by comparison. every now and then my wife will ask me to user her phone to read texts to her while she's driving and the iphone just looks and feels so tiny to me now. the s-pen is fun to use with it's numerous apps where it can be utilized like word search games and jotting down quick notes. samsung really packed a massive amount of technology into this device and it shows. pros -huge screen with beautiful color -13 megapixel camera with numerous settings and filters -the s pen is creatively utilized -the processor is lightning fast, transitioning between apps is nearly seamless. cons - s voice which is samsung's version of siri, needs work but they're headed in the right direction. -rear camera protrudes which makes laying the phone on it's back, susceptible to scratching the lens, however there are many cases that protect it from this. -can be a little difficult to hold and operate for people with hands on the smaller side. there is a bit of a learning curve, but if you're switching over from an iphone, you will pick it up in no time. there are many things that can be done with this phone that it is difficult to cover it all, however there are numerous videos on youtube exploring these cool features. i am 100% happy with my decision going over to an android and i couldn't have chosen a better phone to do it with. the galaxy note 3 is just an amazing piece of technology, plain and simple .   awesome phone. it may be a year or two old, but it's still a bit more powerful than gs5. the screen is so crisp that i put my hd movies on it, sit back, and relax .   great buy. works great just some apps crash and didn't before .   the case was easy to install and seems to protect the phone. my only complaint is the way the case snaps together makes it impossible to plug in any cords with a large hub near the metal pin, such as auxiliary cables for the car stereo. other than that it's a great case for the price .   it is like having a laptop computer in my pocket. i'm very pleased with it .   phone worked and was shipped as described .   great. so far has exceeded my expectations. been reliable and suits my needs to a tee. the large screen is very nice to have since i don't have a laptop currently. gripes include unable to moves file from internal memory to memory sd card and since running kit kat have been unable to use as a hotspot without having to pay for it .   i love this phone. it is user friendly and i love the size of the screen .   i love my phone i just wish it would with the weather have a live weather this phone will not do that i was really disappointed in there other than that i use it all the time i love it i love it i love it. this is my second note. i can't tell much difference in the 2 and the 3. i loved the note 2 and i love the this one. before i was sold on the iphone, but there's no comparison. android is better than ios, imo. i am glad they changed the back of the phone. it's not slippery like the older versions. that's a big plus .   good. 5 stars, enough said. great phone .   absolutely amazing phone i love it. action memo is so useful i use it all the time. but i have to say my favorite parts of it are the battery and the screen. i only have to charge it like every other day and i haven't been able to kill it in a single day. and the super amoled screen is amazing i have dropped it more than once and there isn't a single small scratch on it. it's amazing! but there is one thing i don't like the positioning of the home button. i'm a lefty so when i put it in my left pocket the button is facing down so when i sit down sometimes it will get pressed and turn off. but that's the only thing i don't like. according to what they say there service is great everywhere. not so. i can not get service at my home and very poor service anywhere in my surroundings. i called at&t customer service. and the woman i talked with told me to return the phone to amazon. i will be doing that tomorrow .   really enjoying the larger screen. i have most recently moved from iphone to gs4 and now to note 3. i can still use it one handed (granted i have large hands) and the screen size means i am using my ipad mini less and less. i don't find the pen too useful and can't say i have ever used it other than showing it off to friends or colleagues. happy with the build quality and the fact that i can add more storage and carry around a spare battery for those long days away from an outlet .   love the phone. if you like big phones and a tech savvy person you should go for this phone .   love the phone. i used to be an iphone fanatic but i'm glad i made the switch. awesome display and customizable options. the only complaints are that after the kitkat software upgrade the battery life is significantly decreased and the power cord becomes loose with repeated used .   great phone! it's exceeded all my expectations .   was everything i was hoping for ðÿ˜€ðÿ˜€ðÿ‘ðÿ‘. good looking phone. had one scratch at the side. didn't bother me at all. came next day and i am impressed. awesome .   i am quite pleased with my purchase of this note 3. i was able to get it next day for only $10 more, and a price of about $400 i couldn't really pass it up. i was skeptical about buying a refurbished device and was hoping it wouldn't be a fake or anything but it's the real deal, looks good works well and everything. only a minor ding on the bottom right corner but no screen scratches, back scratches or anything. presented with the charger, s pen and phone itself. i'm presuming its locked to at&t but i will look into unlocking it because i am not on contract. one problem is that i am not able to get lte and i've even gotten a brand new sim for the use of it. possibly an at&t issue but will check it out. another minor thing is that it does not come in original packaging, but a weird box .   i love, love, love this phone. i upgraded from an htc one x, which i also loved when i got it. to begin with i was torn between getting the galaxy note 3 and galaxy 5, and published, consumer reports said that beside the slight difference in size, a deciding factor would be if the consumer wanted the convenience of the note 3 stylus or the water resistance of the galaxy 5. but when i got the phone, i found that the note 3 stylus is far more than just a stylus: it also has a remote function that will access several features that pop up on the screen when you command it. these are features i will use and would otherwise have to go in to the programs to access. one of my concerns was that the note 3 would be too big to handle, but as a female with moderately long fingers, i don't have any problem holding on to it. lastly, amazon had the best price for a new at&t samsung galaxy note 3. i paid 50% less than i could find in any store or website .   thank you .   wonderful, perfect condition .   awsome phone! love love love it! does everything i need it to do and more! team android .   i love my phone .   i am very pleased with this phone. the best phone i have had to this date .   i think i like the phone; still learning about it. saw a brief comment about online tutorials for spen etc. but haven't found them. screen is awesome and so are the pictures. my biggest issue that brings the overall score down is frustration with att - took me over an hour to be told i had to wait 24 hrs to try to register on their website again as they had the wrong zip code put in - they told me to use the wrong zip instead of fixing it - and over 90 minutes on the phone the next day trying to get the number ported correctly. in the meantime several calls/messages were "lost". hopefully things will progress more smoothly in the future. i do have much better connection and the phone works well. will upgrade review if i find that to be the case .   absolutely love it .   best phone i've ever owned. i gave my iphone 5 away once i saw one of these and orders this beauty as soon as i could. i've had it for a few months now and i'll never give up on samsung, especially if they keep up the larger sized phones. once you start using a phone of this size you won't be able to imagine going back to a tiny little 2 inch phone that you can barely use. if you use your phone a lot then you will love how much more room you have to work with on the note .   there is a lot of social ridicule you receive as a owner of this phone. i find myself having to explain my purchase decisions more than i did when i chose android over ios. i don't know how many times i had to demonstrate how easily it fits in most of pants pockets. i get a lot of praise for the screen size, which is one reason i was drawn to this product in the first place. so i am not sure if i am just moody, but today the phone has received a 3 star rating, maybe 3.6 star. complaint 1: i have made many road trips in the last 3 years using only the gps in my phone. most of these trips were with my galaxy sii. there was only one time the galaxy sii left me stranded which was when i was in the mountains in kentucky, but figured out my way home after a short visit to a convenience store. i retired the gsii with the note 3 and regretted my decision when several of the travel/map apps kept dying. that could be poor programming of the apps, but when the phone restarted several times during the 19 hour trip, i had to bring out the old gsii to make it home. complaint 2: i cannot integrate the stylus into my life. the stylus makes it fun to draw on the phone, but since i am not an artist this is not as much a selling point as i thought it would be. this is not really the phones fault, but i like i said earlier i am moody so i am going to lump it in with review. complaint 3: i have had so many apps die on this phone and currently i cannot get google play nor gmail app to even load anymore without asking me to send a report. this is probably not the phones fault and maybe more of a complaint against google, but one reason to own a smart phone is to have access to your email and i currently do not have access to it. i recently cleaned out the phone so i can reset to factory defaults to see if this addresses all the issues i have experienced with google apps and various others. complaint 4: this phone has what i believe to be amazing horse power, so i do get ticked off when loading apps, answering the phone or taking a picture have any lag. this not a consist problem but happens enough to put on this list. i love the screen size, the 32 gb of storage, the horse power, the picture quality, and the battery life. i also love using my phone as remote .  it really makes the hospital staff angry when you turn the station from cnn to telemundo and they have to try to find their remote. i know it is childish, but there are only a few simple pleasures in life .   i give u a 3 because the phone is pretty stuffed up for 450 price tag. dad is a big fan of the note series already .  very easy on the eyes. this one improves battery life and user experience so much that he transferred to the new phone with no issues .   great smart phone that has all the features necessary in the mobile world! you can do more than you can imagine .   the phn freezes up. powers off. i think this is a used phn! i regret purchasing it online instead of going into the att store. i will never do it again. i work so much. but next time i will take a vacation day if i break or drop my phone .   so far so good! i've had this phone for a couple of months now and it is head and shoulders above the previous phone i had (samsung skyrocket). battery lasts all day with plenty left over (i use it constantly through out the day). it's responsive to my touch and with the s pen. i'm still learning everything it can do so i'll have to add to this post at a later date when i figure it all out .   i'm on at&t contract, so when it came time to upgrade i got this gorgeous phone. the only downside is locked bootloader. but rom devs still came thru with rooting and some international roms are ported. so freedom is still there. rooting allows me to remove some unneeded programs and also save some battery with greenify app - to gain full control of my phone in other words. other thoughts: if you are looking for contract free phone with big screen and gpe like experience and unlocked bootloader - look at sony xperia z ultra or samsung galaxy note3 for t-mobile .   i thought this phone would be like the authentic note 3 from at&t, but it is a complete copy of it and it has a very cheap exterior. also i did not receive headphones or other items presented in the original package. i would never buy a phone from here again .   awesome phone! battery life is noticeably sustainable on a busy day with no recharge necessary. it is difficult to have a conversation putting it up to your ear so headphones or bluetooth earpiece is a must. the phone is huge but manageable once you get used to it. fast and responsive. does everything a phone and a tablet was made to do .  love it .   i received this a few days ago and have been working with it, it is big but i really like it, lots of new things to learn about it, but i cant wait to see what i discover next that this phone can do .   overall this is a fantastic phone. there will be more weight in your pocket but after several weeks it's hardly noticeable. a fantastic size it forced me to sell my now unused tablet. android apps and web browsing won't strain your eyes like on old phones and allow you to be "drawn in" to what your doing, rather than thinking how it would be better served by a larger device, like pc or tablet. overall if your a web browser and heavy app user, this is the phone for you. it serves this purpose so well. if not you might want to look into something smaller .   i've had this for several weeks. it's a high performer in every way. the gps issue: it receives gps signal like a champ. i am editing my review after having this a few more weeks. i expected to have gps dropping problems because of the many reviews and blogs i had seen mentioning it, so i mentioned that problem in my review. but to be fair, after weeks of testing, the gps and online navigation works very well and i see no need to use the workarounds mentioned in those forums and blogs. either they have fixed the problem with the newer phones software, or the trigger for the problem which seems to have to do with switching from one type of data connection to another while on the move (i.e. lte to 4g or different towers or w/e)does not occur in my area. i have att and live in san diego county and i drive for a living. i used the gps to navigate to about 20 addresses a few days ago over an 8 hour period of time. not only did it get me there and never drop signal, but the battery lasted me all day (i did turn the screen off when i it wasn't needed and listened to audio instructions so the screen was only on 50% of the time). it saved my but when my normal navigator, a garmin, had nowhere to plug into in the vehicle i checked out that day. so basically this phone is spectacular and the only potential flaw i heard about doesn't affect my phone or my area. i bought this from amazon online. databyter. that's what she said. no, really, she did say my phone was so big, but then really loved the screen. i've been a samsung guy since the captivate. this is by far the best phone i've ever had .   this phone is huge. which i thought would be great. it also has a pen, which i thought would be very handy. i did use the note feature for a little bit but this phone is so huge it's annoying. i can barely put it in my pockets, i can barely fit it in any of my purses. if you are used to i phones, the functionality is much more complicated. you have to press a lot more buttons to do one thing. it has all these apps on the phone like a computer and you can't get rid of some of them. it asks you which app you want to open pictures and videos with every time instead of just opening the pic. also annoying. you have to press the back button to go back through things which is very annoying. i would like to sell mine if possible .   received in perfect condition. completely satisfied. large screen with great resolution. good battery life. easy to set up. i wishe it came with earphones and protector case .   i've had my galaxy note iii for a couple months now and i love it more everyday. i downloaded an owners manual and read it everyday ! i didn't know if i would like the larger size but it has been great  .   i love this phone. i love it specially because of the big screen and the samsung softwares. i am surprised to see how accurate the hand writing algorithm is .   loved the s-pen. only issue i am facing from my day to day use is the position of power button and volume control button. i press these buttons very often by mistake. i don't know how other people feel about it but i think they need to move to somewhere else .   bought this as a gift for my wife. she had an iphone that was having some battery issues and other annoyances. she was pretty much a die in the wool apple person (all other electronics are/were apple). she loved it over her iphone. the screen resolution and size was soo much better than the iphone. battery lasts just as long as here iphone battery use to last, but she gets way more power. she loves all the new features. the stylist works well. she likes being able to write down a phone number, have it convert to text, and then click on it to simply make a call. she is also using my nfc tags that i have already set up at home for my galaxy 4, where it simply turns on the stereo, closes the garage door and sets the house temp to home mode (no we do not have a smart house, just some cool add on devices - way cheaper). i could not get that to work with the iphone. anyway, she loves the phone and is very happy with it. did not have any trouble learning all the new features .  that was the fun part. so if you are thinking of giving this as a gift to an iphone person .  i think they will be astounded by the performance. just make a bit more investment so that they get to use some of the fun features .   like nfc tags etc .   nice features, amazing screen, superfast processor. recommened buy. the s pen is a great tool and comes in handy for quick noted .   i like the size of the screen. i was having an issue with software but the update fixed the issue. the size is slightly larger than expected but it fits in my shirt pocket so that is not an issue. the pen will come in very handy to make reminders on the run. good choice of phone for me. got this for my wife and she loves it. a little on the large side, but i guess you know that if you are looking at it in the first place .   i am sure that all of you know all the stats and the "tricks" off of youtube videos. i won't go into those (if you don't just google it) this phone is an utter powerhouse. i mean i am hard pressed to use enough of it's cpu to grab a stall. now that kit kat is available (got it up and running last night) it is even faster. as for user friendly this phone does so many things to just make people go "does my phone just know that i want this?" i am massively impressed every day, even after 3 months of using .   i switched from an iphone and i don't miss it at all. i never use my ipad anymore either. perfect size and has so much functionality. i didn't like the android platform (home screen) so i just downloaded a better one on the play store. now its super simple like the iphone but has much much more .   the phone is great! it does everything you need and more. i have given up my iphone after using the samsung note 3 for 2 days .   i love this phone. i wanted the note 2 when it came out but it wasn't time for my upgrade. i'm very happy with it. i actually do school work on my phone. i very rarely use my tablet. it's the best of both worlds .   i wont go into reviewing this phone because all the reviews are in and the masses say this phone is great and i agree. however, beware of the known gps signal loss issue that this device suffers from, i believe its specific to this at&t branded device. if gps is important to you i suggest reading up on the known issue and visiting the at&t forums to see what i'm talking about. the sad thing is at&t knows about it and seems to be working on it but no fix seems in sight .   big amoled screen for my old tired eyes to watch moves or browse the net, stylus+digitizer allow me to draw, good camera software with 120ps slo-mo capture. plenty of third-party accessories. good xda support with third party roms .   this is by far, the best smart phone that i have ever owned. the display is amazing and the processor is mad fast. the camera is very good and the call quality is nice too. it seemed huge at first, but after a few days other phone seem tiny. i am a true fan .   i am enjoying the larger screen that this phone has. i use it mainly as a tablet instead of a cell phone .   this is probably one of the best phones i have ever owned. the camera is amazing, even in low light conditions. the ir blaster has an amazing range. i was in the cafeteria at work and i was able to turn on captions from about 150-200ft away from the television. the battery would last me the whole day and i was getting about 4 hours to 4.5 hours of screen time per full charge. the only issue that i had with this phone is the screen size. i have medium sized hands and one handed use was impossible. the 5.5 inch screen got too big for me. 5 inches is the ideal screen size for me. i currently have the lg g2. it has amazing battery life and cyanogenmod 11. touchwiz also slows downs the phone. i believe that rooting and having stock android rom is required for every android phone these days. manufacturers fill up the phone with too much bloatware .   we purchased this phone for my husband as his phone was old motorola as replacement.its big but better performance ,battery really comes for 2 days without charging even if we use it a lot.samsung has lot of new features than iphone as i use one. phone is awesome with great features  .   yes its all dat, at&t is fast  .   good voice rec .   it don't like me all wifi no use gigs for $$$ , so i fix it some day .   if you are planning to use this as a gps with google map, beware of the potential lost gps signal in the middle of your route. update : to be fair to samsung, i think i am obligated to update my review. after the os is upgraded to android kitkat, the gps is working fine now .   the galaxy note 3 is an outstanding phone-tablet hybrid. it's really the best of both worlds. the screen is big and beautiful. and the innards are strong, fast and smart. this phone is too good for me. i now sleep on the couch so ä¸»å› note 3 can have my bed .   i am and will be discovering what this phone can do for some time. i write, it converts to text, reads back what i've written in a proper female english voice. i thought the old clunker it replaced was good but the samsung galaxy note 3 is great .   i love this phone i will never go back to a smaller phone and i use the s pen more than i thought i would. amazing resolution, great battery life, great features, light for the size. it does everything i want it to do like make it easy to type because i have hand problems i can appreciate it. numbers always on the screen is real helpful .   phone doesnt come in original packaging and no headset thats about all i found wrong with it .  the phone works amazing tho. by far the best phone i have ever had. i had the orginal galaxy s and s2. i was not very impressed with them so i switched to the iphone 4s which i kept for 2 years then made the switch back to samsung after playing around with the note 3 in the store. by far the best phone  .  has the best features and andriod software is a lot better and more capable than the apple os or windows for that matter. could use a few more apps though especially free ones. apple store always had a wide selection of free apps unlike some of the 99 cent apps in the andriod / google play store. those dollars add up quick .   but as far as phone capabilities, software, screen size, s-pen feature etc there is no comparision .   hi, prior to buying note 3, i was using iphone 4s. infact i don't have anything to comment on iphone 4s and i was very happy. i was looking for a phone as i completed my contract with att (iphone). then during thanks giving i saw that galaxy s4 was for free if i just upgrade. almost decided to buy galaxy s4, but when i saw note 3 i really started loving it and it was priced at $299.99 with 2 years contract with att. so i decided to buy note 3 and waited to see if the price drops. meanwhile i did couple of research to see the feedback for note 3. and i was pretty much happy with the features and other users response. last month i oredered my phone from amazon and been using since 2 weeks. all that i want to say is that note 3 is a great phone. after using samsung galaxy note 3, now if i see iphone 4s .   never i can go back to use a phone with small screen. now am used to note 3 screen. this phone has all the features that has stuffed within. if you are looking for one, then this is a great phone. for 1 day i felt its a big phone but now its no more big for me .   it's everything i was expecting and more! and it arrived much sooner than i anticipated. i have really been enjoying my phone. and the size for me has not been an issue .   i bought this as my upgrade from a iphone 3gs soo lets just say i did wait a long time for the perfect phone  .  love the screen and all the cool features .  and amazon has the cheapest pricing for this phone and fast prime shipping :). after looking forward to this phone for a very long time, i finally received it. i am very pleased. it did its best to meet expectations. i suppose i just wasn't blown away .   why doesn't it come with a set of headphones? how much can it cost to add a cheap set of headphones to the most expensive phone on the market .   love this phone this was my second the first one i had to send back because there was a default with the motion sensor but amazon quickly sent out a replacement since then i've had no problems with the phone i love the screen size i love the android os and i love the lte speeds only problem i have with this phone is that speakers sound a little then but the very doable.also i wish that you can turn off the lte speeds and switch from lte back to 4g because it's really is a data hog .   iove this phone! i've made the switch from the apple iphone 4s and i didn't think that i would like the android operating system. but boy was i wrong i love this phone i love the screen size and i also love the whole android experience. the only thing that i don't like is that the lte service will consume your data plan fortunately i'm grandfathered in with my data but i shoot thru 5 gigabytes within 7 days this phone should have a switch that you can turn off lte switch to 4g when you don't want to use as much data and the second i fault is the speakers they are little thin sounding but the doable .   i have been an apple iphone since the beginning, but i fell in love with the samsung galaxy note 3. i will never look back at the apple iphone again. does everything i want and more! i can actually see everything on the phone without my glasses .   excellent phone. after being an apple iphone fanatic for 4 years, this phone can do so much more. ease of use is great. android system is fantastic. the size is perfect .   i love the large screen. note 3 is faster than other notes. i use it more than galaxy tab. i could really use a training video, there is so much more to this than i can figure out! help .   good phone, but android is too complicated for my mother to use. there is a easy mode, but you don't get any of the widgets. i should have gotten her an iphone. we in the family have own several galaxy models like s2, s3, s4, and note 2. every model that came out was always a striking revelation and improvement of the previous. now i just upgraded to note 3 (at & t) and i couldn't ask for more. it's capabilities and functions are just mind blowing. and with its huge size, it's a 2 into 1 deal you can get, a smartphone and mini-tablet in rolled into one. i don't need to carry with me now either my ipad or tab alongside with my smartphone. i can always drive and travel light with it. the battery is very impressive and it could last me 2 days with the lte 4g on all the way. processor, touchscreen and graphic user interface are fast and responsive. screen resolution is so crystal clear and vivid. i am totally happy with this guy and couldn't ask for more .   i returned this at&t phone, i fully paid for this supposed "without a service plan" phone to use it with a different carrier, but its locked to at&t network, and at&t will unlock it after you use it 6 month under at&t network with prepaid service (gophone) .   it very good for me, one little thing is drain battery quickly download or surf on the web, the other 5 stars .   i finally updated from the note 1 to note 3 .  what can i say but after 2 1/2 weeks .  i absolutely love this phone. when i first switched from iphone to note i had my doubts. but .  i will not ever go back to the iphone .   i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she was thrilled to death! the camera features are really cool and pictures are so crisp and clear! and i got it for 100 less here! my husband and i have the note 2. both are awesome phones .   what a amazing phone. i give this phone as a gift to my girlfriend since she broke her s4. first of all, the phone is fast ! compare to any phones, this is the fastest one so far i ever seen. second, the apps  .   amazing  .   the note series of phones are the best phones out there right now. i love my new note 3 is the awesomest. great for those who text or surf the net as well as talk on the phone. users manual online only, no headset provide which would be nice to listen to media and other things so everyone else is not listening to your stuff or so yo can here better. new mini plug not sure why that is necessary .   i love this phone .   well made, great screen .   you can customize however you like. as a small tablet, it can't be beat. i bought it because it's the only one with a built in note taking app .   which is very useful to me .   couple of major pitfalls however killed the dal for me: as a phone, it's useless - one handed dialing is not possible unless you have andre the giant sized hands .   i even used a really cool feature that moves the keypad to the right part of the screen for right handed users. you have a press a favorite contact twice before it dials voice command .   well, it's not very good and can't access it unlocked photos - you have to unlock the phone, then click the camera app - too many steps and you lose that kodak moment battery life - no better or worse than other phones .   i require a bright sceen so it's never been a good possibility for me pros - awesome screen you can watch a movie on it and it's great - lots of real estate on the screens - widgets are way better than simple apps - open system means lots of flexibility - thinness of device, weight too - big screen lets you actually see what's on your calendar - that was very nice i had real hope for this but it failed me on a recent business trip .   voice recognition, making calls, one handed operation gave me carpal tunnel .   so i'm returning it. i'm certain it will bring many users much happiness .   but it depends on how you use it. coming from iphone, the galaxy note 3 feels much larger in hand and difficult to operate with one hand, but i like the camera and the screen area it provides. note 3 has viewing area that is almost double that of iphone 4 and 1080p resolution is definitely a plus. i still am not familiar with all bells and whistles of it, but am loving whatever i've getting to know of this phone .   the exact model number isn't listed on here but what i was given was the sm-n900a version which is the snapdragon 800 version running at 2.3 ghz. i ran quadrant and antutu right out of the box and had gotten 23,099 and 35,668 respectively. (for those unfamiliar with these benchmarking programs, these scores absolutely demolish all the other phones out there.)(it's embarassing to say that this phone is actually more powerful than my 3 year old laptop by .2 ghz.) i was a little worried i might have gotten the exynos version because i want the best of the best. i purchased it on amazon for 200 bucks in november. (only to find out it dropped even more to 150 during december for att, which is ridiculousy low. i don't know why it dropped that low but it's back up over 200 now.) i think i got a pretty good deal considering it retails for 300. but i digress. i have used iphones since the 3gs in '10, 1 3gs and 2 4s. i lost the first 2 and the last was .   let's just say it was my 21st birthday and there was a lot alcohol involved. imagine water damage but not water. yea it was pretty gross. great birthday present for me right? well if it wasnt for that, i wouldn't have gotten this awesome phone. i got used to it super fast. i fell in love with it. with samsung there's just a sheer amount of little things to fiddle with. there's a huge amount customization possible. the one thing i loved was that a pro version of sketchbook made specifically for the note 3 was already preinstalled. that's a 5 dollar app. as an actual phone, voice quality is great. ypu can use the first 20 seconds of mp3s as a ringtone but you can't choose a specific part of a song. (you can get around that by making a snippet and putting it on your phone). texting can be cumbersome at first with such a large keyboard but you can also swype to text and there is a voice record option i find myself using often that writes what you say. it's huge but not bulky in the pocket. a case might make it bulky but as a regular guy with regular jeans, it's fine. (sorry, ladies.) pros: -ridiculous battery life: average usage with average use is always 10-14 hours. -swappable batteries make battery life irrelevant -there exists a 10,000 mah battery for the note 3 by zerolemon and that's crazy. -expandable micro sd card -can run just about anything in the app store. -stylus, i actually use it for sketchbook and drawing in snapchat. and also for action memos lol. -13 megapixel camera -4k recording. 4k .   recording. cons: -it comes in an ugly orange att box. not the cool wood-like cardboard that i wanted. :/ -can only use multi window with certain apps. (this might be changed with future updates.) -camera flash as a flashlight isn't as bright as an s3's light. -doesn't come with headphones. note: all information is written in jan 2014. some of the posted information may become obsolete with future updates, etc .   if you have any questions about this phone feel free to email me at wslysmsn@yahoo.com .   i have had the note 2 and now the note 3. i love the new technology samsung comes up with! easy to use and great features .   big display, real stylist, insane specs, wi-fi ac capable, ir blaster, nfc, expandable memory, usb 3.0. , capability of qi wireless charging and s-view case .  this thing is a beast and a true flagship phone .   dont ever buy a new phone from amazon with any wireless carrier. why? you might seem to be getting the phone at a smaller price but you cant forget about the $100 deposit if your a new customer. and if your uprgading it they will add more money to the price and im not talking the uprgrade fee. thats not even the big problem. the biggest problem is, them sending me supposedly two faulty sim cards with the device, then lying to me and sayin that the store could give me another one but they cant. on top of that my number didnt fully port through, phone didnt activate (cause amazon activation instructions dont work and it showed, my sim wasnt faulty they just dont know how to activate a sim and at&t did thankfully) and to top it all off at&t didnt get the $100 deposit from amazon! so they charging me (again). did i mention the s-scroll, smart pause, and air gesture dont work on phone? (although i think a handful of people have that problem too, might be a samsung thing) this is what you deal with when you dont get your phone directly from the wireless carrier. just amazon and at&t customer service pointing fingers at each other sending you in circles for a week to finally get phone activated .   this review will be for the product shipping and customer service received when ordering this phone: i ordered this phone on dec 16. i received it on dec. 19! i live in in hawaii. i think that's a record! packaging was perfect. couldn't wait to open my new phone! called customer service to confirm all items would be in there to upgrade cell and they were very helpful as well. phone review: i'll one this phone. so much to customize and settings are so much more. i have been an iphone user for 7 years. it was hard to change over. but so glad that i did .   you can read the specs above (or other reviews). i am going straight to the meat of the matter. pros: the best screen @1080p, this screen is bright and vibrant. multi window feature is nice! i use it all the time, especially pairs like chrome+maps, youtube+chorme, gmail+snote, etc nice camera (13 mp) with many features. watchon remote; i control tv and cablebox with the phone cons: huge battery hog. i need to charge the battery (sometimes) 3 times a day. hate touchwiz. it is a horrible ui. the ui wastes pixels, samsung could have used smaller fonts, and better grid to layout 5 icons in 1 row. hate the easytouchwiz home screen, which sometimes shows up when backing out of settings hate the physical buttons.  .   samsung, earnest request from an ardent android user,  .   please let these buttons go. my fingers are not fat, but the frame around the buttons is so thin, i accidentally hit the physical buttons when i rest the palm, or hit the screen buttons when i touch the home button. i strongly recommend buying nexus 5 over samsung note 3  .   there is nothing earth shattering about this phone .   arrived promptly. i was researching for this phone at the right price and i found it here. love the phone and have had no problems .   i upgraded from the s3 with sprint to the note 3 with at&t. the service with at&t compared to sprint is like night and day. sprint may have unlimited dats, but when you are getting less than 100kbps it's not really that unlimited. even when it was connected to lte there were times when i still wasn't getting more than 1 or 2 mbps. i consistently have an lte signal with at&t and get 15mbps or more down, with it rarely going below 5mbps. on the device itself. it's a great upgrade from the s3. i never have to worry about battery life. the camera takes great photos if you know what you are doing and the stylus gives you some great extra features. the screen is crisp and colors pop. hints for the device: if you are outside with the device and in direct sunlight you will definitely want to put into auto brightness mode instead of cranking it up yourself. auto mode will actually boost the brightness higher in situations where it needs to than what you can manually. you are better off using google music (or another 3rd party app) instead of the stock samsung player. i have found that, for whatever reason, there is more noise when playing through the samsung app. i tested this in my car, same song, directly connected. if you want a decent amount of protection, but don't want a ton of bulk, consider the s-view flip cover and spigen's magnetic clip to keep it closed. it may not look like it gives much protection, but if you look closely at the cover it overlaps the device. so if you were to drop it, it would hit the cover before it would ever hit the corner of your device .   i hope there is a time sometime in the future when we don't have to pay $750.00 for a phone that is loaded with 9gb of useless bloatware and commercials. capitalism at it's best. other than samsung's attempt at control, the phone is great. helpful hint (i hope): if you are having random wifi dropouts (as i have, and several other note 3 users) purchase a router that operates on both 2.4g and 5g spectrums. my other router was only 2.4g and my note would drop the signal about 50 times a day. i rarely ever have my wifi dropped now since i stay on 5g signal. my galaxy s4 never had this problem with the old router, nor does my verizon htc one max .   just the note 3 .   great phone. easy to use.size makes this phone much easer to see .would make this purchase again. being able to write on the phone is it best feature .   as a tech geek, i really enjoy the note 3. i was going to get the mega, but with a 1080p display, i couldn't pass up the note 3. plus, it has a faster processor than the mega. this is a great phone .   enjoy this phone every day. compared to the apple iphone 4, it is huge in allowing the eyes to see. and after downloading apple i0s 7 which was horrific .  this phone has great graphics, super ability to hear the other person and oddles of free downloadable apps. now if it will just hold up as long as the sturdy apple 3, 4 which i never would have even switched from, if they ios 7 had not mucked it completely up and made it impossible to read the screen /able to hear persons on the other end. so way cool:). with the note 3 .   its got a faster chip which makes everything run smoother. i love the added ir feature that let you control your tv , cable box and surround sound .   i love my new phone. i've been with samsung for the last three phones and they just keep getting better .   i have been playing games on the phone and the phone sometimes randomly shuts itself. i would like to get a replacement if this happens more in the future. pros: screen size, screen brightness, stylus, battery life (2+ days if minimal use), amazon's free 50 mb cloud service, form factor (can hold and text in 1 hand comfortably), lots of touchwiz features to explore, photo quality, build quality cons: fits all my pants/shorts pockets but snugly went with a 2yr contract with att and this is the phone to get you through those 2 years and beyond. i've been using the stylus a lot - grocery lists, to do lists, spur of the moment memos, games, email, etc. i've read lots of reviews online from tech 'experts' and the best reasons they have against the phone are: touchwiz bloatware, no optical image stabilization, plastic back. none are even close to mattering for me. buy it already .   i am an apple product user. i have a macbook pro, i use an imac and ipads at work, and so on, so i have a grasp of apple's osx. i was afraid that the switch and learning a new program would be difficult but that wasn't the case at all. there are some things that apple does better and vica versa but i am standing with my decision. not because i am bound a 2yr contract now but because i have tried them both and this fits me better. i was afraid that this might be one of those "too" good to be true thing since the product goes for $179 (+ data plan and taxes) w/a 2yr contract on amazon and nearly twice as much (+ data plan and taxes) at the stores. but seeing that the sellers are amazon, i took the chance. if this was a "knock-off" then they have done a very good job :). fyi i believe that staples is selling the note 3 for 1 cent w/a 2yr agreement. but the catch is that you have to have never had a phone contract before, etc. check their requirements for more info. packing: very generic, almost careless. when i received my box the item inside wasn't held in securely, so the product and things included rattled around. when i opened my box the phone itself almost flung out. also it is labeled as brand new but the seal says "qc approved". phone: if you are an artist and/or business person then you are going to love the s pen. i hardly use mine though except for typing, yes typing. i love the android software, it's very easy to use and customizable. there are some features that i do miss from apple products but i don't mind discovering new things on android. the phone itself i am very satisfied with. it is a little slippery at times and feels tight in your pants when sitting if you wear fitted pants. i went to the movies with it in my pockets and i thought that the pressure from my fitted jeans had warped my screen a little. whether it did or not it is hardly noticeable. as of right now i am typing from a macbook pro. only because i have to charge my phone. the battery life is okay maybe it's do to the fact that i kept playing with it. i am now a member of the "people neglecting real life brigade". :). i am lovvvvveeeee this phone. i upgraded from samsung galaxy 2. i was considering going back to iphone but thank god i did not. this phone is addictive. i love the s pen, all the little things you can write and draw with, shortcuts. battery life is excellent. pictures, videos are crisp clear.huge memory, nice leather back, super light. it is big for my tiny hands but that why we have blue tooth and ear phones to talk on but it's great for surfing, videos .   just awesome .   good job samsung. this is a fantabulous phablet .   i have been experiencing pda/palm withdrawal for quite some time. a friend suggested the galaxy note 3. my children purchased my upgrade for christmas. i absolutely love this phone! i think it is a prefect multipurpose device. phone,internet, music, calender, books ect. all in one device. i know there are other phones that perform these functions but the increased screen size makes it so easier to handle. this phone is a grand slam .   i could write and write and write about this phone. it is one of the most amazing phones i have ever owned. the amount of options and clarity are unreal. the note 3 is pure perfection. feb 19, 2014 update: i have returned my note 3 and will now be going to iphone 5s. the gps on this phone is pure junk. it does not matter where you are or what carrier your with. for what is now listed over $700.00 on amazon i would expect the gps to work. i am amazed that amazon has hiked the price of this phone since i purchased it by over $100.00! i also started to have freeze ups and it would require removing the battery to fix it. i don't know why but it always seems that with android phones they start off great and quickly degrade in performance and the note 3 is no exception. this makes me sad because i really do love the size. well it's a love/hate i guess. in any case, i will be moving back once again to apple and the iphone. small screen, yes - but it's a trade off for ensured quality. this phones price currently on amazon is not worth it with all the issues .   i received the phone when i tried to add my sim card it did not come unlocked and was told to enter a unlock pin. let's keep this simple. my wife and i have been iphone 4s users for two years. my kids have ipod 5s. we were an "apple" house. after two years of struggling against the intentional design limitations of the apple products, i decided we had to consider an alternative. so last summer i bought a samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 and spent some time sorting out the differences between ios and android. the tablet is great, and we slowly got used to the differences in operating system. in late november i bought my wife the galaxy note 3, and it is fantastic. it impressed us so much that i bought another one for me and a third for my sister-in-law a week later. it is fast. it is crystal clear. it is light. it has great battery life. it has great connectivity with our home pc through wifi or usb. it plays excellent hd video to our tv. it does everything the apple products do, but better, faster, cleaner and with less hassle and frustration. oh, and it does something apple won't do. i also added a cheap 64g memory card to each phone, and we are swimming in available memory. i can even offer some advice on size and cases. my wife has the otterbox commuter (no holster). i have the otterbox defender (black w/holster). my sister-in-law has a simple plastic shell case with her favorite team on it. the phone is perfectly sized for my wife (who uses it mostly at home) and my sister-in-law (who uses it mostly at work). i worried that it would be too big to fit on my belt (like the old iphone did - also with an otterbox). worry not. it is thinner and lighter than the iphone, and otterbox has made the new case more efficiently. i hardly even notice that the phone is bigger on my belt. it rides just right. the galaxy note 3 is the perfect compromise between a larger screen and still keeping it a handset. if my kids were old enough, i would be getting them note 3s also. who needs a computer anymore? ignore the bad reviews about the "cheap plastic" back cover. the back cover is nice looking and perfectly form-fits with the guts behind it. the result is a very professional-looking and solid-feeling design. i much prefer it to the old iphone feel. we don't even use the stylus, but it is kind-of cool. if you don't need the stylus, just leave it stowed. i forget it is there. we love the galaxy note 3 .   i bought it for my wife. she wanted a bigger phone, and she loves it. i would love it too if i carried a purse, but it's too big to fit into a man's pocket. but that's no fault of the phone. it was everything it was advertised to be .   this phablet does it all, except cooking a meal. i have not looked back at other smart phones on the market ever since i started using my note 3. it is awesome. apple and their fans, take notes because you're missing out .   coming to this after the nokia lumia 1020. i loved the camera on the 1020, but it just can't make up for the lackluster os. i left iphone for the nokia, and now that i have the note 3, i doubt i'll ever return to apple. the camera, while good in overall performance, does leave a little to be desired in the consistency of sharp focus. everything else is great, though i notice, the signal strength on this phone isn't quite that of the iphone or even the nokia .   i've used this phone for a few hours after activating and getting an update installed. but the phone has already frozen up two times, requiring me to hold the button on the right side for several seconds until a restart. no, i did not install any new apps, the phone froze up when i was trying to read email. and then the phone often freezes for a few seconds while doing simple navigation, but then continues. (no, i was not watching a movie or listening to music.) maybe it's a hardware defect? also, there's so much bloat/crap-wear that's difficult to remove, or can't be removed, and some can't be disabled completely (like my magazine) - and those consume data bandwidth. and i thought with all the processing power that this device claims to have, the ui would be snappier. instead it's only very slightly faster that my previous iphone 4s with ios-7. and with ios-6 this note 3 is slower. i've seen older android phone and they are sooo slow, compared to iphones - i think those who say this phone is fast are just comparing it to older androids. but the screen is a nice size, and without a case and protector it feels cheaply made, unlike iphones which seem more solid. (but i'm sure others have dropped and broken their iphones.) if the phone continues to occasionally freeze up and the phone needs to be replaced i'll update this review .   switching from the original at&t samsung galaxy note i717 this upgrade was much better than expected. mind you after years of experience with at&t bloatware the first thing i did was root it and freeze all that junk. i mean geez who uses that at&t navi app, or the half a dozen sync tools and services only for at&t/samsung devices whose utility is redundant, inferior, or annoying to what comes in a base android system. now i can easily make it two days on a charge even with everything turned on. i protected it with a spigen neohybrid case, and iloome flex glass screen protector both of which i can recommend without reservation for this phone .   best phone ever! who's got the best phone in the world? i dooo .   used to be an iphone fan ever since it came out up untill iphone 4, then it got boring. now i am an android fan all the way! and this is the best android phone on the market to the date .   have been using iphone since 3gs came out. i'm thinking it is time for a change, both the os and the size of the phone. so i picked the note 3. so far so good. big screen, easy to customize, can even remove the google search bar, woo hoo! battery life wise, it is doing ok, usually it can hold up a day's use. but it is just ok, nothing surprising, unlike what i heard about the g2. the stylus is amazing, very convenient to take notes with it. camera is fine, but the camera app is inferior compared to iphone .   does everything i want my phone to do. + more things to make life easier make sure to get protective cover for it .   super fast shipper wow incredible but this phone is what i want and more you can do whatever you want with this wonder its incredible. this phone has everything and the kitchen sink. power, battery life, beautiful large screen, and stylus. couldn't ask for more .   major gps problems, apparently gps problems - appear to be a hardware problem on some phones. see http://goo.gl/paix3v for details. otherwise this is a great phone and worth noting at&t shipped me a replacement and it works great so far(hence raising from 1 star to 4. also, worth noting, a middle finger raised towards amazon for not supporting text to speech in kindle on amazon and for not supporting video and amazon instant video on android when it is supported on kindle which runs android. basically they have pushed me to purchase books on google and video on vudu. i assume this is not what they intended. more details: note 3 - this is long: a. wanted to only carry 1 device, not phone, ipad, and a kindle. to do that it means i am starting to buy books from google or convert from kindle to google. this is for a very specific use case - i find it valuable to have text spoken to me as i read technical or other non-fiction books. i need to try the general screen readers as well. mostly it is less good at this use case then i wanted. b. i chose to invite complexity of android into my life by getting a note. i would recommend android to almost no one. c. if you choose android give up any pretense of privacy. you have none. stuff i did on my phone began showing up on my laptop searches. i now use tor router, a limited keyboard and duckduckgo for much of my day to day work. check out google play guardian project apps for a bit more privacy. i believe iphone and windows phone are superior in almost every way. for me solving the myriad problems of it was a way to refocus on a consumer product and technology in general. c. a consumer should not have to go hunting for a podcast player (pick your favorite standard feature,) nor should they then have to download 4 which each have radically different ui's to pick their favorite. d. no one should have to use touchwiz (sorry, i got a hairball just thinking about it. ) e. it is huge. f. mine appears to have a gps defect, new one arrives today or monday. g. every useful app wants access to everything about me they can find h. bluetooth stereo fails in my car so most of the voice features fail for me - bloody heck, my iphone 4 worked better! and yet, i find it works well for me. best i can tell it is for a series of reasons - *'s next to the ones that are strongest: *a. email while less pretty works well and has a filter by unread mode which i like. *b. being able to read all the events on the calendar in month view is glorious. *c. nova launcher makes me happy (without this i would have returned it due to touchwiz) *d. the battery just keeps going e. being able to swap keyboards is nice *f. after a month i began actually using the stylus. for note taking in meetings it is less obtrusive and works very well. *g. the large screen is glorious h. i have become a fan of todotxt(.com) and it works well here *i. i loved that i could try 70 gtd todolist apps till i found one that i like j. evernote and last pass work well. *k. multiwindow is awesome **l. widgets rock (tip of the hat to nokia symbian for this idea.) *m. dolphin browser n. google now, though a privacy nightmare, is very cool things that would make it perfect: 1. if i get screen reader working to read just when i want, 2. if i could get it to read and let me respond to email .   i love the shape of this mobile, the leather look is too cool. only because of the shape and build i dint go for s3 and s4. its big for my shirt pocket but it comfortably fits my pant pocket and the battery last for 12hrs(nearly 3-4 hrs of songs, 1 hr of browsing and 1 hr of gaming, also sync to my personal and official email and calender) .   this thing is so fast it puts my laptop to shame. (samsung r580 core i5). at least, it sure seems that way. that may be because it surfs the mobile web sites. anyway, to get to the point this phone is a speed demon. it has so many customizable features you can personalize it almost any way you like. wallpapers, passkeys, lock screen tags, app arrangement, voice recognition, it's all here and then some. if the screen size bothers you, simply enable "one handed operation" mode (be sure to check every box under the menu so it functions across all apps and screens), do a quick swipe of your finger from right to left and back to right, and the screen shrinks down to a customizable box that can be operated much like a smaller cell phone! it can even recognize when you're looking at the screen or not and shut itself off or pause vids accordingly. the battery is huge and has lasted me all day. it's very thin and light. 4g lte service is the fastest i've seen on a phone. i switched to at&t from sprint specifically so i can get the most out of this device. sprint never had 4g in the 3 years that i owned my previous phone, the epic 4g, even though i paid for "premium data". in my area, (central louisiana), at&t delivers. sucks that data is not unlimited and my monthly plan costs more, though. i have only tapped the surface of what this phone can do. the camera is amazing. video is amazingly sharp and it picks up sound very well. i saw posts that image stabilization for video was not included but i'm pretty sure it actually is on this model. there is a tab that says smart stabilization when i recorded vids for the first time and i enabled it and seemed to notice a difference. i haven't even tried the 4k resolution yet and i am blown away. coming from a first generation galaxy phone to this is truly a worthwhile upgrade. basically, it's like carrying a very capable desktop computer in your pocket. the phone is quite large, but i got used to it in a couple of days. the swype function is better than ever and even more responsive. it fulfills the main things i planned to use it for .  watching youtube and netflix and recording sharp video. as time goes on it can evolve to meet any other needs i may have of it. it's good for business use or fun. it's like i got a great camera, video camera, web browser, phone, computer and gaming machine all in one! i plan to get the smart trade 2 year warranty from amazon to cover this baby. as of now i am protecting it with a bodyguardz screen cover (highly recommended and sold on amazon as well) and an incipio phone case. if you're gonna spend the dough for this thing you may as well get some decent protection and coverage .   i wish i had read somewhere that this phone takes a special charger. while one is provided for the phone, i will have to go out and buy extras for my office and car. it is probably my fault, and i missed that tidbit of info, but i am disappointed. i thought all cell phones were supposed to have a uniform charger now. apparently there is a loophole i was not aware of. it also takes a micro sim card instead of the standard. the faux leather battery cover? it doesn't look that bad when it is on the phone, but when you lift it off to put in the battery, it is unbelievable how flimsy the plastic is. i expected more for such a high priced phone. i am also having a lot of trouble getting a good protective case for it. otterbox, lifeproof and griffen have not come out with theirs yet. i have found others to use until they do. however when i order them, i am told they will not be delivered for up to a month. the graphics are stunning! the keyboard is much better equipped than my droid. i appreciate that the numbers are their own separate buttons. i'm just getting started learning the features and apps. it is pretty complicated so far. i am used to htc droids. i'll update more later .   for those unfamiliar w/ dope, its a slang term that means ur awesome. i cant believe there arent more reviews. anyways this is the sweet spot for phone size. once u get this size phone u realize 2 things: 1. u cant ever go bigger than this, its just not practical and 2. u cant ever go smaller than this, it just wont be the same enjoyable experience my decision to go to this size was i just though about how many actual instances in 1 day i use my phone and realized it was a ton. it just made since to not go cheap with something that i use so frequently. these phones really are becoming our little companions that do so much and more every day. you get used to the size quickly. i have small hands and i adapted very easily. the phone has settings to make it easier to use 1 handed for common things so that you dont have to reach inches away to press a number or something. the speed is incredible. browsing the web is super fast and the batter life, omg, i can finally have a live wallpaper running all day and not worry about running out of battery before i charge up at night. battery is simply amazing. spen is fun but i wished the button on it acted like a mouse click all the time. it does on a few things but not most. thats all for now, i dont regret my purchase and knew i wouldnt, now if otterbox would just finally release there commuter case i will be good to go .   .l.but maybe after i cool off a bit i will revise my review. the note 3 i purchased was supposed to be new. the box it arrived in had been previously opened. the box was torn up on the inside and the ear buds are missing. the phone seems fine. i haven't even turned it on yet. many may say that i'm being too picky .  but s*** like this really bothers me. i paid over $800.00 for this phone! i should get exactly what i paid for! 10/13/2013 okay i had some time to calm down. and thanks to a response to my review i have been made aware that at&t repackages there phones and remove the ear buds. sorry for griping about nothing. i have upgraded this phone from 3 stars to a much deserved 5 stars. this phone kicks butt! my favorite features are the big brilliant display and the s pen. i just can't put this thing down. i can't find anything wrong with this phone other than the enormous amounts of bloatware. but, most cell phone have this problem. i highly recommend this phone. it's a beast! you will love it. the hardware specs on this phones are so impressive that it will remain relevant for at least the next two years .   i've had this phone for two days now and there just isn't anything i don't like about it. screen: the screen is a beautiful 5.7" fhd samoled display. while it is not a true rgb display, it is still absolutely gorgeous. the viewing angles are superb and the colors are close to natural (assuming you use the movie mode). size: i bought this phone knowing it will be the largest phone i have ever used before. it's actually smaller than what i thought it would be. it is pretty much the same size as the galaxy note 2, but also a little lighter. i can use most of the features with one hand, no problem, but i have pretty large hands (piano hands). thin bezels just add to the beauty of the phone! look and feel: i very much love the aesthetics of the phone! it's a real eye catcher. i love the textured back , it feels solid and it definitely won't be slipping out of my hand. i prefer the more squarish design of the note 3 more than the round, "natural" design of the note 2. it looks more futuristic. the volume buttons and home button are rock solid and provide the right amount of physical feedback when using them. although, i find myself accidentally hitting the home key a lot. camera: the camera has been wonderful so far. i am by no means a photographer but it does the job superbly when i do want to catch that rare photo. the video on this thing is amazing compared to what i have had before. the 1080p 60 fps is so smooth i love it. it's a little scary, actually. call quality: everyone has said that i have been coming through loud and clear, no issues. everything is clear on my end, as well. sound/speakers: this phone is capable of high quality sound through headphones but i never use headphones. the loud speaker is somewhat disappointing. it all sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. i don't use the loud speaker all that much though so it isn't a deal breaker by any means. software: i love the s-pen, i find myself using it a lot more than i thought i would. i use the scrapbook option a lot as i use stumbleupon daily. good place to keep recipes, especially since i can tag things then search for them later. i love writing out notes as well and then sending them to people. i hate s-voice. it sucks and pales in comparison to siri or google now. i had the option to say "hi galaxy" when the screen is off turned on and it turns on randomly! it did it once in the movie theatres! so embarrassing. i froze that app asap. battery life: wow. 5 hours screen-on time with mostly auto-brightness, but i generally watch an hour worth of videos a day on full brightness. it lasts all day and then some. it also charges in roughly 2.5 hours as well. i am very pleased with the battery life. there really isn't anything wrong with this phone .   i love every aspect of it. it never lags, it handles everything beautifully .   the only thing i didn't like was s-voice, but i also knew that when buying the phone. nothing has let me down so far. if you are on the fence about buying this phone, just buy it. you'll love it! actually, there is one thing i don't like. because of the type of display, white colors drain the battery more quickly than darker colors. on the international variant, the dialer, messages and contacts have a black background whereas the at&t version has white backgrounds. this is dumb and needs to be fixed. but seriously though, buy this phone. have a good day .   wow .   what a device. the moment i opened the box and till date i am awestruck by the beauty of this phone. i had note 2 prior to this one, if you compare the two there is not much of a difference (from the perspective of light user like me). but within itself this is a beast of a device. there is hardly anything you can not do with this device. they have diversified the use of s-pen, the colors are good, the videos look stunning on full hd screen. i have always been a fan of bigger screen phones and this one does not disappoint me any one bit. i think it is a great choice over other big screen phones and even apple. the ease of use and compatibility with so many devices add a new dimension to this device. i love the way i can share the screen of my phone on my smart tv wirelessly. from my side full marks to the device. if you think you can handle bigger devices, this is the one for you, look no further .   excellent .   good. great. perfect delivery! without any details or problem. received the item promptly. the item, after a month of normal use, is defected with a green screen. additionally, the signal is very often weak. at the same location, i removed my sim card and placed it into a different phone and it worked much better .   excelent. not to happy, it got damaged beyond repair in a short period of time .   good. phone is working perfect until now, no problems detected .   the phone was defective. it kept doing stupid things. would not recommend samsung .   i appreciate. phone cover as been quiet disappointing too much scratches on it but the rest of the phone is not very bad .   it's not what i expected, i couldn't connect it to my phone company .  soo disappointing, not worth buying .   i recommend it, thank you very much. congratulations. great seller, and good product a+++++++++. excelent. did not work with at&t internet .   after a year of use its barely given me trouble. excellent. i will never buy a phone like this again or from the dealer it came defective and i was given poor service by the sealer. why can't products like this come with a good manual in words with pictures that i can understand? manuel was removed from internet and replaced with newer ones. saw a video showing me how to take the phone completely apart and put it back together again but nowhere could i find the answer to what i thought was a simple question. lots of us first time buyers don't speak geek .   ok. a1++++++++++++. good. bought for my wife she loves it and now, three years later wants the s7edge .   ok. i am very satisfied with the product. it was on time and came as described. very good product no problem .   excellent product, i loved. i recommend both the seller and the product. thank you. it was not what i was expecting. pros: great 4.8" screen good set of features excellent battery life advanced call quality features state-of-the-art everything cons: expensive camera photos tend to be a bit overexposed screen difficult to read in sunlight s voice not as good as siri construction quality not the best. i had issue while os upgrade and this phone crashed failing it to turn on. amazon asked to check with samsung & samsung us could not repair it as it was an international model. and i ended up with purchasing samsung galaxy s6 .   the charging cable into the socket was defective, but the rest of contents including the phone was very good .   grate phone! and came very fast and without a scratch. excellent. i dropped it & broke it. bought a gs4. not what i expected. 100% recomendado. phone should be unlocked but message from verizon stating that your not using there chip. unlocked should be empty .   phone small and plug in cover for charging seems frail and doesn't hold on your hands very well, also buttons get pressed too easy. if screen has anything like greasy or damp fingers phone jumps around .   no vino desbloqueado. 1 year dead. exclent product. it's as expected .   good phone. much nicer than expected for a used phone .   wrong item. all ok. excelente. a+++. good. it was great in its day. but now its an antique .   product came on time and working as expected. bad. product i received isn't gsm and is locked .  device also appears to be fake. i must have posted the wrong review earlier; this seller and the product are as described. looking forward to future orders from same seller .   the phone has problem on calling, it got an laud echo voice while you receve or make a call. we were could not stop the sound .   good. nice. excellent. i like. working perfectly according to the person i gave to as a gift .   perfect! thanks .   great phone. as new. still very useful tech at a steep discount .   it was a cell phone until i turned it on, than it transformed into a paper weight so i had to send it back .   great. good .   arrive fast and safe thanks. no surprises, work as expected .   excellent. dont buy it is not updating the software. the phone was a used equipment when the publication was saying again. it was a hoax.samsung galaxy s3 i9300 unlocked cellphone, international version, 16gb, blue. no problem with the purchase, i am satisfied, excellent product for the price. quick delivery, product as described. no issues. only whth a 1 month the cellphone fail and im change to apple. i love it  .   thanks. fine. excellent phone. escelente. good ã­tem. worked great. very helpful. very good and works perfect. avoid this product. i purchased it on september 2015 and it became rubbish within less than 2 months! it was shutting down automatically every 20 minutes. the product has technical issues which may show up within 2 to 3 months. when i called samsung to repair it, they said the product is out of warranty since 2013 .   the funny thing is that the seller gives you only 30 days warranty from the date of purchase to return the product back. otherwise, you will be responsible for repairing your cell phone. save your dollars and buy something useful .   its not unlocked phone .   be carefull dont buy it will not work properly in usa. i bought this phone for my wife. now both of us can enjoy these superb products. when i got mine a few years back i had to flush a different version of android because there was a bug that caused the battery to drain real fast. i was pleasantly surprised when my wife's phone had no excessive battery drain out of the box (battery last 2 weeks with light use). save me some time and headache with the flush. one of the best features of the phone is the camera. that is where samsung included a lot of their proprietary state-of-the-art. the phone does not support lte but it's still plenty fast for our needs .   i'd would like to know about the warranty , i bougth this item on may 2015 to you but my phone it does not turn on , it's died yesterday. the item stop working. i sold a phone samsung s3 new and rebuilt as many failures to conclude not wanted to change me. exelente. excellent. do not buy phones offline learned my lesson here! was refurbished or used cause didn't work properly .   i love this phone to the max. good product. other than poor battery performance, it's great. i bought an anker 7200 mah battery and all/s good now .   i love the frame. it's awesome. the design is beautiful .   this was a terrific purchase. i did not need the most up-to-date cellphone so settled on an earlier version of samsung phones. this phone was introduced to me by a son who tutor me in its use. this phone does everything i need a phone to do. the phone was shipped immediately and arrived within a few days of purchase. nothing could have been easier. the phone was brand-new, fully packaged and sealed. one minor issue justified the 4-stars. the backing plate does not completely seal in one corner. had i had the opportunity i would have shipped it back for an exchange but needed use of the phone immediately. no real problem though as any concern was mitigated by placing the phone in a protective cover (otter box) that i purchased for the phone. very satisfied, i would highly recommend the seller and phone to anyone of my friends .   very good. cellphone is reported as stolen. i've had this phone for a few years now. i am so happy with it, i refused to trade-in or buy the latest versions .   excelente. this phone sucks. i only used for half a year and this phone was almost broken. the battery can hardly support for 5 hours. besides, you need to continuously charge this phone. really bad experience .   good phone. i bought it for emergency. the price is cheap. however, i really don't like samsung because it is too slow. it was fair compared with the price and the phone .   i bought this phone and i used it until 6 month. now is blocked .   it works perfectly. nice phone. excelente 100% satisfecha. excelente. great condition. was exactly what i wanted .   junk. love it. good one .   bien. excellent

expectations. excellent product, good seller .   a*. the product was delivered in good condition but the video does not record properly with it sounding similar to when wind blows into the speakers throughout and sounds terrible. i am sending it back to get a refund .   utter waste of time .   i love it thanks. good. fail. great phone .   excellent product and very good seller. exelente. it worked perfectly well after been set up with a new sim card .   it was not unlocked when it said it was. disappointed .   all its ok. all good! excellent product .   exelent. i needed to return it,

excellent. battery was bad / international phone all in korean! sent it back .   pretty good phone, but has some bugs - like difficulty in finding a charger that works for it .   great phone. a real work horse and takes a lot of abuse from our kids .   excelente. i'm a happy customer. good phone. buena. okay. thanks you. ok. ordered this phone a i9300 this is not what i got i9301 all the time wanting the 9300. the power button does not work well on my galaxy s3. i understand that this is a common problem. to help to resolve the problem, i installed an app that is called "knock knock" which i use when i wish to put the phone to sleep. and i use the bottom middle button to wake the phone. this saves me from having to use the power button most of the time .   my wife like it and still keep it. old model but still good product. the phone is fast and it works as advertised.the screen flickers ie. the screen dims itself then goes back to normal occasionally with the auto-brightness disabled .   quick delivery. all i had to do was buy the appropriate chip and was connected right away. the power cord is international, but had an adapter for usa, easily assembled .   very good and goed prijs. exceeded expectations, works great. this was a gift for my girlfriend and made her really happy! :) i have s3 mini .   good. working well i am very happy with it. thanks .   great product .   amazing seller aaa+++. all perfect .   good. responsible salesman, recommended 100%. the battery didn't work. bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it .   was not able to activate with verizon even though it specified that it is opened .   very very disappointed, dont buy frim this selller because they oviously dont know what they are selling .   very good product. delivery was fast

battery back in the phone the battery last less than halt an hoiur then it rundown  .   i had to pay to unlock the phone, after that it worked well in nicaragua. good. had phone for few years .  it started to slow down. i love it. content. this phone was sold as new but in fact was badly damaged internally and was poorly reconditioned. the first week of use it has to be charged 10-12 hrs at night and only last 2-3 hrs each day. by the second week it would not charge regardless of how long its plugged in and subsequently start to over heat. when taken to a phone repair specialist it was discovered that the components on the inside that should take the power from the charger and send it to the battery is severely damaged an need to be replaced. i am very disappointed with this shipment .   nice phone. clicks so good pictures that are really clear .   got this for work and it was great .   it's great .   great buy and great price. works just fine, almost no problems what so ever .   muy bien. excelente. good one for my money. needed a factory unlocked phone and i like samsung over apple. it is 3g enabled .   excellent. good. excelente celular. it's an ok phone. the retailer of those gadgets do not give some important information, this phone has apparently been asked to lock on 2g .  soo it barely works on the 3g my country works on .  soo that's a mess .  soo my internet is most of the time low .  the quality of my signal bad .  aww .  tought i can't swith it on the settings on 3g or provider supported network .   very good phone. very good. ok. works well.

card slot not functioning. it is excellent. not as described,it is not an international version,i am disappointed .   had for a year now works great and great condtion unlocked as said. loving it. very good picture quality. wasvery happy with them. this samsung mobile is rejected as duplicate in my home country - india. sim card didnt catch signal cant call and attend  .   the phone dont work is bad .   works good for me. it arrived in time. the cellphone box was sealed. cell phone was original and brand new. checked with the app. "phone info". camera, sound, calls, (skype) works properly for now. for the moment i see no problems regarding this cellphone .   this s*** fake nothing fit not even my sd card, no body buy this because there is no refunds. i brought this as as gift for my father in laws and he is very happy to receive the phone . the performance is great with good audio and camera. the s3's camera is even better. it may be a 'measly' 8mp, but samsung has played around with the software in order to create a camera with zero shutter lag, a definite plus. now it can take great looking photos, quickly.the battery life is also great as he says he only needs to charge once the whole day though he isnt someone who would be on the phone all the time.the phone feels solid and light to hold .overall he is very impressed with the phone .   i love it. the cell phone is fine. tried it for 6 months. went back to apple. samsung hardware is crap .   it is okay .   like it .   i was dis appointed of this refurbished product where the plug go was bent and rusty. appreciate great condition .   excellent product quality. i am very disappointed with it. some times it does not turn on just buzzing only. since i returned the first one i did not want to return it after 2 weeks and go thru a long process to get another one .   great so far .   doesn't work. thanks. it was excellent. 100% happy with purchase. excellent product, good material. exceelnte. loved this phone until i discovered the camera did not work. i thought at first it was just the software, but after trying everything samsung suggested and taking it to a samsung shop they suggested i return it. amazon was great handling the return. i ordered another galaxy s3 and the camera worked on it. great phone if the camera works .   didn't receive a new phone. the back of the phone won't stay shut.extremely disappointed with this purchase .   it's not charging anymore. i bought new chargers and it works for first few days and then it doesn't work. those chargers works perfectly fine on my friend's s4. of course there are other problems like turning it off on its own .   goos. the phone contained all the information from the previous owner and it came damage .   excelente. great phone , even though i had issues with the battery that came with it , and had a buy another one. i bought this phone 9 months ago. the first two weeks, it worked wonderfully. then it has been nothing but issues since. maybe it's just the phone i got because i've had to pull some tech wizard magic to get it back to working several times. next time i'll just buy it straight from samsung, like i should have in the first place. also it doesn't come with a warranty through samsung, so if it does break much later, especially within the year that you've bought it, you can't send it in to get it repaired .   i paid about $250 for this phone and i regret it. the phone has nothing but problems, the keys don't work properly, it freezes all the time, now it won't even charge. when i chose to buy it, it was describe as a new phone but when i received it i could tell it was used but i needed the phone so i kept it but what a disapointment this has been .   service cuts in and out using international version in ohio (had no problems with other phones) and the international version doesnt upgrade to a good os. working great so far .   great shield is jus nice. phone is fine but the fact that they are shipped with no battery sucks .   perfect. even though samsung has reached the s6 model i know the s3 model to be a great deal since i had friends with it. with that being said, i must say that it didn't work out to be a great deal for me. for some reason, there's a delayed response when i press the back button or if i try to navigate from one page to the next. my advice to others is to spend a little extra and invest in a more updated phone. sorely disappointed. does not hold charge at all. i lost my money. i stop using samsung. it cost for nothing .   the phone work just fine for 3 days. one night i was watching my facebook and the screen turn out all red. the phone starts but the screen is all red. i am very dissapointed because i was a fan of samsung. that was a bad deal because the screen was broken and it's shaking  .   excellent product. nice phone. it has to be the best .  since i am an galaxy android man  .   excellent. i ordered this phone basing my choice on costumers reviews no one mentioned the fact that this phone had a major issue the charger tip was loose.charging this phone was an every time challenge .i had to return it to the seller and they promised to sen me a new one i don't have any complaint about that they were very responsive but when i got the new one it had the same issue i was so busy that i couldn't think about contacting the seller again and now my phone is dead because i cannot charge it anymore .i will not recommende this product to anyone.and iam done with buying electronics from amazon .   dont buy it, or buy it from somewhere else. this phone is ok if your broke and dont have a choice. i had this phone a few years ago and never had a problem which is why i decided to buy again. my mistake was buying it from this seller, its from japan or something. not an american galaxy s3 its something else a 'gt' something. it came with weird japanese apps and im getting weird virus emails only on this device, they do not show up on any of my others devices or my online email account. other than that as said before it is ok. however, i wouldnt buy it again if i could rewind time .   excelente. good. good. excelente. excellent seller and product .   the worst error of my life. i bought a galaxy s3 (i9300) but they send me a galaxy s3 verizon 4g lite (sch-i535) and this model don't work with bands in other countries, the real s3 (i9300) does .   excellent good product and delivery. wonderful smartphone! everything you need .   runs well .   the phone that we received was not unlocked and could not be activated because it had an international stolen alert attached to the serial number. we are in the process of sending it back .   este mã³vil me dio muchos problemas siendo nuevo le tuve que arreglar el puerto usb y el boton de home. me senti estafado .   this cell phone gave me a lot of trouble being new i had to fix the usb port and the button of home. i felt cheated me  .   excellent. ok. i don't know what happened with the package. i would rate it with negative stars if they were any .   the phone i got looked great from the outside and i was so happy to get it until i turned it on .   the screen was blinking with no reason and some white and green stripes were flashing across the screen .   i think the "no warranty" words in the cellphone description means "watch out we gonna get your money even if our product dont works" .   professional service. i am happy with my purchase. will purchase more in the future .   it came without earphones and screen scratch. great phone .   no regret. excellent product. it was broke. excellent phone. good phone, good service .   i like it. it's easy to use. it has met my needs for real .   the thelephone was broken. doesnt charge the batery. is an all fruade this phone i feel cheated in the characteristics speaks perfect but is a chinese i repowering phone or it is not what it seems thieves tried to use the phone and not even lift my 3g according alli said to be unlocked factory  .   if they go vendanlo something to sell quality not to rob people .   i havent had it for more than a month but its speaker has issues yet it has never fallen. excelente. excelente producto 100% recomendado. it did not come unlocked as the caption had stated. i had to pay a technician to unlock it and now the phone behaves in a bizarre way .   very good. excellent seller recommend 100%. returned, couldn't get rid of echo on phone calls. phone is not what was expected. factory unlocked apparently means a phone that has already been well used, has some scratches on it and an old battery that depletes itself by 50% overnight in standby mode .   i dont like it. excelente .   exellent cell exact wath i want. unfortunately they sold me as a factory unlocked but when i brought it to my country it didn't work with a different company. exelenteeeeeeeee. this is the second time that i buy the same cellphone, team samsung .   very good cell. came with no chager. nice phone. great product. excelente. excellent. i am not able to download anything. excelente. this is a very good product. the product exactly matches with what was displayed online. love it .   my oh my! people complain about petty issues and others take the complains at its face value, however, after reading about some of the complains from others, i thought otherwise. tim is the man in the customer service department that we can all dream to deal with. he is very professional, understanding and one gentleman that you can trust. i had a problem with the samsung s3 phone that i ought and emailed the sellers about it. they replied replied to my email and delivered as promised. honestly, i will not trade the cs experience that i have had thus far, for a million dollars. i dealt with tim and he was right on the money. indeed, i have never regretted my experience with this seller. just give them a shot, and you will always go back to them for your phone and other electronic needs . if i could rate them more than 5 star, i would have done just that! kudos to tim and his team .   very good. everything offered excellent article in the publication every perfect. everything was perfect. thanks. this doesn't latch on to a network properly and keeps getting disconnected. one would get a 'phone switched off' or ' out of coverage area' message if they call. a gift for our daughter. battery is bad. cellular doesn,t charge properly. the charge dissapearedd in minutes. so god. it is excellent  .   exelente. amazing. screen went out in less than a year. but it was great before that. i assume just bad luck. i have ordered another samsung galaxy s3 .   i got an att phone, completely different from the phone i purchased that was the unlocked international version. it has an old version and the operating system cannot be updated! i kept it because i had to leave on a long trip, i had no time to return and purchase it again. i had to return two previous phones because of the sale problem.there is no control quality  .   really enjoying the phone thus far, took me a little while getting used to the size compared to my last phone, which was a galaxy young and was tiny, but other than that it's a perfect phone .   good. not goog. perfectly new .   excellent. the sim card slot was broken after a few days of use. i bought it for my sister in ghana. exelent. very good. battery damage. very good. it automatically powers off when unchardged or unplugged. nice. good afternoon, i have the conformity of the product as anywhere i could get the information which is a dual team .   excelent  .   very nice too. i bought this a month ago and it wouldn't get charged up;i had to get a new phone. verry bad! they sent me a kindle paperwhite insted of this cellphone!, the worst part is that i am form honduras so i cannot return it .   great deal and phone. exelente. excelent. it was a good phone .   back cover isn't original. the phone runs out of battery so quick. great .   excellent. excelente telefono. very good. excellent. everything ok, recommend 100%. the samsung galaxy s3 internationl version is indeed a great phone however since no one here wants to point this out i will do so. if you are going to use it here in the usa all i can tell you is good luck!pc metro and stright talk wont activate your phone becuse the one i got was a euorpean version and there mei is 15 numbers compared to the american version which is 14. tmobile might be the only one that might or the dreaded boost mobile which i think is the most bootleg company ever. over all this phone its amazing it plays games, makes calls over the internet and is wifi .   thanks. excelente. bien. great. good. good one. it worked well for the first year. it slowly got worse until it was continually locking itself up after just a few minutes. when i purchase something that costs this much i expect it to last longer than the one year warranty length .   bien. bad quality product! this is a remanufactured phone not a new one, in my case the phone doesn't hold calls randomly it cuts every other call entering or going out sometimes works well qnd sometimes don't, i revised with the phone service provider and it was the phone hardware what was wrong! the rest of the applications work well but what is a phone without its main function .   this was a gift which is loved by its owner. ok. love it so far so good and hook up to at&t no problem to my account good job .   love it. thank you so much. excellent product. phone has blocked! and it is not new! it is a fraud .   100% ok. all good excellent product. good phone. works nice in venezuela. am very upset and dissatisfied, as the article that you buy is not what i expected, the phone has a totally corrupted system does not work does not start will not start, i feel cheated, and you spend what i consider a large sum in dollars in this article, to serve and not lose as much money as the phone, i thank my complaint is taken and somehow i be returned the money or an item that does work, i hope prompt response  .  i'm from venezuela and acquire this article is almost impossible that it trusts you make the purchase by this means, i demand response and solution  .   this is a great phone i have had the galaxy ever sence they came out with the first one  .  to bad i had to send this one back there was something wrong with the antanna. in venezuela serves for any operator .   the phone in perfect condition, the charger damaged. bueno. excelent. todo ok. i bought it believing it will work internationally. i tried every sim card but it did not work. of course i am extrememly furious i threw $200 to the trash as i dont need it in the us and it is passed return period. i have not used it once , but it can't be returned. perfect. had a lot of problems it was sent back. thanks. good .   so .   i bought this phone as a gift to my dad. as any man of 65 years might do, he just put it away until he wanted and got familiar with this new technology (for him). yesterday i insisted him to start using it and so he did. when we put the sim card in the slot the phone seemed not to have signal. i, myself know about cellphones, one of my hobbies is to repair cellphones, specially android ones. this problem of signal is very common on them when you upgrade the software. the strange thing was that the cellphone was "new" and nobody did a sw upgrade. nevertheless, y tried to upgrade the sw, and inserted a sd card on the slot. it did no responded. so i went and open the cellphone and for my surprise, very awful surprise, it had no antena. so you sold me a refurbished phone as a new one with just not one but two bad pieces and one of them missing. great job guys. i would like to have my money back .   excelente. it's an excellent product .   i received the phone properly packaged and the phone appears to be ok. it turned on ok when i first attempted however the battery was low and upon leaving it to charge for about 2 hours i came back to find it lower than it was before and about to dischage. what appears to be a new charger is not charging the phone .   help as i now cant access my phone  .   i managed to transfer my contacts but thats been all. by the time i was ready to transfer my sim card and to download apps i want it had shutdown .   buen producto. this is terrible .   the phone turns off without warning. returning .   everything is nice, just i set the default notification in silence, but still alarming when there is a new mail .   10 points .   excellent product  .   the products say they are new and when you check are fully used and repowering. love it  .  pleased with the purchased, fully recommend. great dealer, its a brand new phone with dual sim, i am satisfied. this is not new, its a refurbished phone do not buy. does not work in costa rica. i want my money back. is not unlocked .   i returned this phone the day i got it. its not new, there is dirt in the cracks under the back of this phone. plus the home screen button didn't even work every time, maybe after pushing it 10 times you might get to your main screen. excelent, ty. this product is so awesome, i am still using it today 3 years later :-) of course through the wear and tear, i have replaced the screen and digitizer .   mine came but was still locked, i still have to send it back .   excellent. although the phone's description said it was unlocked, it wasn't fully unlocked and after being in use for 1 year in venezuela and europe, i moved to the us and it turned out that the phone had been reported as robbed by t-mobile a while ago. i was not able to use it with any carrier even though i had bought it from amazon as a brand new phone. so i had to buy a new phone .   excelente producto .   nice. great phone just missing some things. like a calculator and s voice. but works great. good .   great phone except for the fact that they sent it from the factory with a charger cord that doesn't work .   i'm highly dissatisfied with that .   excellent. good phone. excellent. excellent. i like my new phone .   very easy to use and also a very sharp looking phone to boot .   thank you very much  .   all came to me in perfect condition  .   a big hug from here from venezuela. excelent. all good .   phone was in great condition but since it was verizon it won't let you use your data if you have sim card that's h2o or att. the phone is excellent and work perfectly in argentina .   excelente. excellent. muy productos has not arrived and i get as delivered from the february 20 , as we solve .   i love the phone and everything about it .   i spent like three hundred on this phone and can't even use it because it says its verizon but its not and can't find a sim card anywhere for it i want my money back. wonderful .   execlente. unfortunately the phone was never used. the unlocked phone could not be connected to my carrier's network. delivery time was great though .   excellent product 100% recommend five star well deserved  .   great product all ok. bueno. good so far .  a lot of space .   and nice camera .   perfect. i bought this phone 2 years back . still is works fine. genuine product .   excelent. great purchase. great phone. does what i need without to many bells and whistles .   excelente. horrible .   didn't even last a year. it started off as a good phone but the battery started to last only up to 30% then to 50% and now it can't even stay on for more than 10 minutes without shutting off. don't be fooled .   ok. ok. exelente. exelente. purchase was excellent and rapid recommend. excellent. good night my product is not a s3 i9300 and not grab me with any telephone line signal, as i do? help. my sister in law is using it, she says it's alright. excelent .   not description wiht especification. excelent. i really should of done my research; i have had nothing but problems with this phone: -bad battery, had to buy a replacement -gps does not work -bluetooth is horrificly bad -audio skips constantly, this is an issue with android 4.3 and the s3. -handset volume is too low to understand anyone, this is an issue with android 4.3 and the s3. -despite being a far more powerful phone, it is far less stable and more sluggish than the old lg optimus: a single-core, 500mhz no gpu phone running android 2.x. -international version is not compatible with kies 2.6/3 and you cannot find any official firmware for it. -flimsy back cover has become cracked because of how many battery hard resets i've had to do. today a part actually snapped off of it. i should of sent it back to samsung (but then i wouldn't have a phone) but i tried to fix the issues myself, which bricked the phone, so i can't send it in. i'll probably just give it to a friend who can jtag it. in short, i will never be buying another samsung phone again, i would suggest those looking at this review to go after a lg or htc phone. samsung has pretty much become the iphone of android. i'm going after the lg g2 mini, hopefully i have more luck with that phone .   this is perfect, thaks. received a different model! the listing doesn't say anything about dual sim and i got "s3 neo duos" .   not much difference but for example it doesn't support screen shearing (option is simply missing from the settings) so it's missing features from the standard s3 model that they should have sent according to the description. the phone has a duos logo on the back that even the photos on this item listing doesn't show .   buy it .   it does not work. 100% conforme. excellent product thank you. excellent product thank you. muy buen producto. i love my phone. phone is nice but definitely not unlocked. an its really been a pain trying to unlock .   everything ok. ðÿ‘ž. loved the first one so bought one for myself .   excelent. good product. they are dedicated to defraud and steal money selling damaged goods , just 3 weeks of using the phone and stopped working . gotta make it public for all possible networks. the only thing i didn't like was there wasn't any type of warranty on this product. it works well .   worked great in chile .   the phone works, the wifi stopped working a month. do not buy it. excelent ty. hello, him cedular that he buys is not original it is chinese. bien. the phone is damaged battery heats and nothing lasts, i sold a phone i repowered and i was buying a new phone i cheated. delivered was fast and good product .   $200 for a phone i can not make or receive phone calls on ! the only thing the phone is very good for is texting that is it  .   thank you it's good. i'm old and it was just too complicated for me so i gave it to my son and he really enjoys it. i've seen some of the pictures he has taken with it and they are fabulous .   it is not working totally. the phone does not accept calls and does not make calls. bad no good .   excellent.

excellent item. i love it. excellent item. i love it. excelente. exelent producto very good. good quality. good. excellent. excellent product, great offer. yeah .   excelente producto. good. excellent. this cell phone looked brand new, but it is the work quality ever .   my dream. was the producuto i wanted and arrive on time. excelente!  .   is goood. excellent. this was bought for a friend. initially ordered the i9300 as indicated above but got the i9300i which is the dual sim model but works just fine .   the purpose of this letter is to inform you that the phone bought you do not register in any of the carriers operating in venezuela therefore i request the change of the team, clearly in is specified purchase was released to use it normally, without but i received the phone can not be applied to any network , exigo resolve this incomveniente . i hope prompt response .   so when i ordered this thing, because i had read the reviews, i was expecting to get a locked version that wasn't international. which i was ok with since i needed a new phone anyway. instead i got the international version that was advertised. dual sim and everything. so i have no idea what people are saying when they reviewed it. love this phone .   excellent .   cell came in good shape but it wont runs good as other. so i prefer not to waste your money on it thanks .   i use this phone only one month and it dead. excellent product, good seller .   i would like you to send to me via email , invoice which display the imei of mobile equipment. if you did, i would recommend to the five

slow it doesn't even has a 3g!please dont't buy it. i would not recommend this phone to anyone who is looking to purchase a phone which carries one sim card .   item received as described. after 2 days using it the sound speakers failed and would not ring. besides that erything else works fine .   feeling satisfied with the performance thus far .   i bought it as a gift for a relative. unfortunately did not work for her, i don't understand why not .   i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this phone . after severeal weeks of receiving it , it would randomly just restart continuously until i took the battery out . also another fault with this phone is that it is very fragile, the screen will crack in no time . also, the battery swells very quickly .as a result , the back of the phone doesn't stay on . and it flickers in and out then freezes when it hits about 40% . forcing the user , to remove the battery , plug the charger in and then restart it .overall , this phone only lasted me about 7 months  .   great. great dual sim phone not the s3 i9000 but similar .   great phone with two sim cards. bought this several years ago when it first came out and forgot to write a review. i'm writing one now because this phone is still going strong years later. the screen is still without a scratch or mark on it - and i've dropped it several times but it keeps on working. i'm so impressed by its durability and functionality. i've also bought the s4 and s5 - all great products also - but this s3 is so great due to how long it has lasted and i really put it through the ringer with heavy usage .  and it has never failed me .   he came with the damaged plate. the defects present telefeno therefore could not use it. they should be more sienceros in prubliacciã³n . i

with dual sim slot, the battery was half way charged, and the set up was a breeze. it's much faster to boot up, to download apps, and access the internet than my previous smartphone. it's full of features such as the gps which works with military precision, and a slew of other widgets and stuff that can actually enhance your smartphone experience if not your life. would i recommend this phone to a friend? yes, without hesitation. i read some poor reviews on this site about this product, honestly, i don't know what these folks are talking about because my experience with this phone so far

off vietnam version of the samsung galaxy s3. dont buy this phone. i sent it back quickly .   good .   satisfied. muy bueno. excelente .   very excelent product, thank you .   excellent seller, i recommended 100%. excelente. bought this phone a few months ago to replace the same one i had originally bought but had to send back because the text messaging wasn't working. i went with the international unlocked and have run into several problems. first with the first phone not doing text. i liked that one because it had 4.4.1 which had the spell check. this current phone has 4.1.2 so no spell check. plus there have been updates put out by att (my company) and this phone doesn't detect the updates of the os ðÿ˜  my other complaint is the battery life. if i use it i will have to charge it by mid day. and then if i don't get to the charger quick enough the phone flips out! completely freezes which requires me to pull the battery, which is another pain since i have an otter box. so not only is it not great to be pulling the battery but each time i take the otter box off it feels like i am going to break the phone! the cameral also flips out when the battery is low. even tonight i tried to take a pic of my son. battery said half full so i was very frustrated when the picture came up with lines in it and color distortion. thought it was the settings on the camera so i changed those and then the half of batter went down to a quarter and it froze! didn't even beep a warning this time. between the battery life freezing the phone and the lack of compatibility due to it being an international version it really has been a big disappointment .   i am not sure how it got 4 stars rating. but i request everyone not to buy this phone from this seller. they say it new but it is not. the touch functionality wont work right after the phone is opened from its box .   cellphone is ok but its battery is weak and under performing besides full charge 6hrs or so for many days .   excellent product thank you. excelent! at time .   exelente. all good thanks. excelente. gave as a gift,person loves it.person lives in the dominican .   excelente. it arrived in perfect conditions. sealed from factory. it works with almost all carriers (in the us and south america) couldn't be happier .   oke still working. having still problems with the earpiece still not working. excellent cellphone .   nice. negativo. really good thanks .   the product is good, the bad was to cancel $ 244 for samsung galaxy i9300 and i sent an i9300i samsungã¢ galaxi and what is priced at $ 192.99 .   i loved. good. its dual core en the box says cuad core. i'm please about everything. this product is not original samsung is dual sim and not korean chinese, it is a scam. excellent phone works like a charm me thanks  .   product as advertised .   excelente. shipping time was accurate. product was as expected. thank you .   arrived in good condition, thank you .   perfect. as i wished. it said new but it was refurbished ,it cost me too much money too take out and too fix the camera. excelente .   good afternoon i bought this computer and i do not raise my country i feel cheated internet. excellent i recommend good quality. not agree with the product offered. thnx. exelente. this phone per month to be purchased is damage, the touch will not work well after a month of use , i do not live in america so i could not make the relevant claim, a friend told me i could do it by this way by so now i wonder if i'll be on vacation in miami so they can review it finally worked anymore , i trailed off and not lit more . i welcome your comments. hi, is as expected .   the best smartphone thah i ever have .  amazon, a good choice to buy it .   muy bueno. excelente. bien. recomendado 100%. the product was advertized as "at&t unlocked for any gsm service in the country or overseas (i747 version)." however, it arrived locked. i had to contact the seller to get the code to unlock it partially since it only enabled me to use the phone. i can't do much with the phone including copying the pictures i took with it, updating the os, tethering, etc. the seller did not help me to solve these issues .   quick delivery. item as described. would definitely recommend. 100% recommended. excelente. nope. give charging probs already and receives data slow i need a new one .

excelente. very good. excelente. excellent. fantastic cellphone. perfect condition. works perfectly .   this phone didn't come with jelly bean, but it installed it after i had been on my wifi network. also, i have att in florida and i don't get 4g with this phone. i do get hspa however, which is almost as fast from a practical standpoint (i know not theoretically). i can play youtube videos no prob in real time. biggest problem is there is no mobile hotspot app and i'm not sure if it supports that. if i had known this before i would not have gotten this phone, but would have got one specifically for at&t. oh well, it's fine really i suppose, but i wish i had known to do some homework first .   good price. excellent product, very happy .   okay. too good .   the internet service is too slow, and the phone is not able to give me 4g as it was suppose to. i only have an e at the title tool bar instead of 4g, and that make my internet service very slow .   good. awesome. screen went blank after 3 months of use. very disappointing .   i love this cell phone - have been using it for nearly a year now; it was a gift from my son and i am so pleased with it .   my brother is sooo happy with this. i bought this phone in a rush for someone because i was travelling to another country and i was unable to return it. the samsung seal was broken. be aware! the phone i received is a french model

phones now. i will have to figure out how to root it. product used. very good. great phone .   the cell arrived in perfect condition and with all inclusive. just that it's dual sim, i came as a surprise because i did not know but it's not bad news. i love this phone. well with screen protector included, that glad day. brought details not wise but not bad .   this is totally a counterfeit of samsung galaxy 3, the phone would only charge up to 86% even when i tried to use a different charger it would charge more than 86%.i returned it,never bother to buy this phone. excellent product.

for the past few months the phone hangs all the time (i have to reboot it when this happens) and the charging port is faulty so i'm forced to put the phone at a certain angle to charge it. it can also stay overnight being charged and still not get fully charged. in comparison, an iphone 4s that we bought in october 2012 (one year before we bought the samsung) is still going strong with no mechanical or software defects whatsoever,. all well and on time. excellent cellphone everything was ok, the samsung galaxy is 100% working .   very good product, it manages two sims perfectly. my

the screen faded and then completely stopped working. i have no idea if i was sent an incorrect product or what happened - but clearly product failure within 2 months is not acceptable or expected .   it wasn't for me it got here safely thou the case i got was cheap looking. an impressive phone. very functional. i bought it for my teenage daughter and she would not put it down .   great. great. excelent. excellent. i receive a "samsung galaxy s3 i9300i neo", not "samsung galaxy s3 i9300 16gb - factory unlocked international version blue " as the product page described. i bought this phone for software developing,i need exactly "i9300",not "i9300i neo",why dont you state yourself on the product page .   excelente producto. i bought a samsung galaxy s3, as described in the product's title, but when the product arrived, i realize this isn't the product i purchased, they send me the samsuns s3 neo, but that's the only problem, the cellphone works well .   recomendated 100%. magnã­fic tlf. unfortunately the phone is anounced as i9300 model, but i did not get that model; i got a i535 by verizon that is partially block and i can only make phone calls, wasting the real purpose of this phone. the phone works. mobile was reconstructed. i purchased the galaxy s3 i9300 and there was an issue with the phone. i was not able to get data on the phone and the roaming did not work. they didn't work because the menu option was not on the phone at all. when i tried to get support i found out that this phone was not made in usa but in hong kong and that is where i go for support. i have tried around the clock however, there is not chat available or phone number or even an email address. yes this phone has a one year warranty and i just opened the box but i am out of luck. don't buy this phone .   the phone itself is nice. but the version i got was t-mobile branded and full of bloatware, and that's not mentioned in the description! after rooting i got rid of about 30 pre-installed apps which helped speeding up the software a lot .   ok. as expected. good .   very good. lo recomiendo. excelent :d. item returned .   excelent. exelente. 1. todo very good. good.

ok. i purchased this phone for my son. much to his dismay the phone does not charge .   it says 100% charged even though the battery is dead. i tried the battery in another phone and it charged fine but will not charge in his brand new s3. can you imagine my sons disappointment on christmas! this absolutely ruined his day. i am really upset! i gave it one star because i have to give it a rating

from chinese also notice dont pick 4g speed. i bought this in march, 2013. i love this phone. despite there being a couple of newer models now (the current samsung is the s5) i see no need to trade up. i put the phone into a protective case, and use a zerolemon battery, and it is as good as new .   very good .   excelent. friend cell comes with state of the modified, device has not official

still lasts approximately 36 hours for my usage scenario. still keeps up with the modern phones no problems, i see no reason to upgrade unless it dies. the phone is not charging. i will print the slip and send it back. it is a sad experience since i was not able to preaent it to the person i want to give to .   the best smartphone .   i bought this phone a year ago, and after 1 month of use the s3 screen turned green and the icons pixelated that's why im submiting a 3 star review since the phone works nice but the problem's still there .   good. good as expected. i love samsung phones. works ok

less. i don't think i would go through this problem again getting a phone off line when the seller told me it was unblock quick money i guess will tell you what you want to hear. after all that the phone been working good .   excelente. excelente. looks very elegant .   tanks, i am happy, very happy. excelente .   i bought a phone to this supplier and the battery is not original . this is a robbery . alert to those thinking is to make a purchase be very careful with this provider . think about it 2 times before buying  .   excellent. very disappointed the volume does not work properly have to use the speaker to hear calls and sometimes that does not work right either. excelente. very well. excelente .   very nice. good product, i liked. after using phone for two months it tried to update firmware by itself and messed up wifi and blue tooth. now it does not work on wifi, i took it back to get it fixed and was told that hardware is not good .   item was totally defective, gave heat warning error when plugged in first time. also back cover was slightly misaligned - would have dealt with that if i could charge the phone at all. i think this was a manufacturer defect that they are re-selling. asking for my money back and wouldn't recommend anyone buying this phone from this manufacturer .   ok. this a neo s3, not a s3 international. perfect. perfect. good phone .   . excelent it works in venezuela. excellente, i love it. very good. muy ienb. buy an "international version unlocked " and what i got was an american model does not work well in latin america. brown box bonanza seller swindled me. very good product. arrived exactly as expected .   exelente. excellent. excellent. buen producto. excelente .   excelente. bueno. great seller and great product .   nice. the charger not working. this is not the ``i9300'' international version as described, but rather the u.s. at&t ``d2att''. for most purposes, this doesn't matter--it is still an unlocked galaxy s3 that works on any network--but it does mean that one cannot install replicant, which only supports the i9300. i installed cyanogenmod instead (using the ``d2lte'' flavor that now subsumes ``d2att'') .   pretty good. like it. satisfecha. it just what i was i was looking for thank you. exelente. worked two years flawlessly .   excellent. is good. good. its was broken at bottom of the mobile. fine. speakers weren't functional and i couldn't put back this phone. i can't give a five stars because i didn't receive a good thing .   it's almost like your local samsung s3, except mine took 4 to 8 seconds to turn on the screen, i don't mean to start up but just to check the time when it's onn. then the back and home screen buttons starred malfunctioning. not going the international route again.

that the only user's manual i have been able to find in internet, after looking everywhere for it, is of 2012, when the phone was launched, and it is of no help at all, because all menus have changed,

minutes it worked, and the alarm don't allow to change the songs. i don't recommend it .   loved it .   while the phone works ok in europe and the us, which is what i need, this is not 4g. here in san francisco, when my friends are on 4g, i am stuck in either 2g (e) or 3g. in 17 months, it has never reached 4g. not even for a second this is simply appalling to me. now i am stuck with it and feel

ago; first of all it was never disclosed to me that this was a refurbished phone. 1. foil protective shield behind lcd was missing, which caused the phone to overheat from day 1. 2. adhesive between the lcd and the phone was not applied properly and only around the edges of the phone. 3. plastic part which was suppose to have been removed from one side of a double-sided adhesive, was never removed, therefore did not served its purpose. 4. sd card terminal was never soldered to the phone and it is loose inside the phone. 5. motion sensor not attached properly, it is lose .   phone came unlocked as stated; works with us and international carriers. seems pretty sturdy as it has been dropped a number of times and is still working fine .   good. excelente. very good. es tremendo telefono. excelente. good price, good product. given delivery with improper accessories. great. it is a samsung neo. confused by what it would be. honestly it's a reasonable smart phone. not high end but certainly will do. it responds fast and screen is sharp. connected to t-mobile with micro card perfectly. downloaded my favorite apps from google and they work on the phone so i have zero complaint .   bien. excellent recommending. great smart phone. i liked the one i bought for my wife so much, i got myself one as well : ) this phone is well worth the $280 i paid. u can get more bells and whistles on s5 but why pay $300.00 more, when this phone gets the job done. only problem i had was the first one i bought the setup was in spanish. had a friend who can read spanish change it to english. 2nd one i bought was in english so i am a happy camper. (remember these are international version, they come in different languages) overall great phone for the $ spent. thanks amazon and shopebest. exelente. can't believe this old phone still rocks .

really good product. muy buenos. everything ok. recommended seller. great purchase. every thing works fine. great purchase. i have been cheated .   i purchased a i 9300 phone. product i received is a sgh-i747 phone but labeled as an i 9300. this has been confirmed by samsung local technical support. i purchased the i 9300 due my phone company works 3g in 900 mhz band and this phone doesn`t work on this band. this phone is an exclusive version for at&t. box and label on the phone say i9300 but it`s not. please contact me to give my money back o change it for a real i9300 phone. this is the first time i buy smartphones so i'll stick to describing my purchase experience rather than commenting on technical specifications, which i believe other reviews cover in much more detail. i actually purchased a used device from tj global. i can truly say it's been a great deal. the order arrived well within the estimated time. the box was closed and properly sealed. it came with all its components (device, charger, usb cable, earphones), all fully packaged and even with the stickers on. i was pleased to find that the device had no scratches and didn't show any sign of having ever been used. the device works perfectly. so far it hasn't blacked out, flashed, flickered or unexpectedly turned off. the battery charges in the average time. i've had it for about 15 days and no trouble so far. the phone is unlocked. i have successfully activated it here in colombia. i use it with claro and movistar sim cards. it makes and receives calls alright, picks wi-fi and does everything it's supposed to do. the user manual came in what i believe is hungarian. this device is a european version of the galaxy s iii, it seems. i haven't seen any adverse effects of this so far. the only difference is that people i know who are familiar with smartphones have noticed that this version is slightly slimmer than the one sold in colombia, and upon comparison it appears to be so. by the way, if when you get calls you tap on the green button and it does nothing, it's not that it's malfunctioning. you have to tap and drag the green button towards the red button to the right in order to answer a call. i lost lots of calls and was close to return the phone before i learned this. i recommend this product and the seller tj global. i'll edit this review if i have a problem with it in the future. if i don't, assume it's still working perfectly. *** es primera vez que compro smartphones asã­ que me limitarã© a describir mi experiencia de compra antes que comentar sobre especificaciones tã©cnicas, lo cual creo que otros reviewers cubren con mucho mã¡s detalle. comprã© un aparato usado a tj global. puedo decir que sã­ ha sido una ganga. la orden llegã³ dentro del tiempo estimado. la caja estaba cerrada y debidamente sellada. vino con todos sus componentes (el aparato, el cargador, cable usb y audã­fonos), todo completamente empacado y con los stickers puestos. me encantã³ que el aparato no tenã­a rayones ni mostraba ninguna seã±al de haber sido usado jamã¡s. el aparato funciona perfectamente. hasta ahora no se ha quemado, ni centelleado, ni parpadeado ni se ha apagado sãºbitamente. la baterã­a carga en el tiempo promedio. lo he tenido por cerca de 15 dã­as sin problemas hasta el momento. el telã©fono estã¡ desbloqueado (liberado). he podido activarlo aquã­ en colombia. lo uso con sim cards de claro y movistar. hace y recibe llamadas bien, coge wi-fi y hace todo lo que se supone que haga. el manual de usuario vino creo que en hãºngaro. yo dirã­a que este aparato es una versiã³n europea del galaxy s iii. no he visto efectos adversos hasta ahora. la ãºnica diferencia es que la gente que conozco y estã¡ familiarizada con los smartphones ha notado que esta versiã³n es ligeramente mã¡s delgada que la que se vende en colombia, y al compararlas parece que sã­ es asã­. a propã³sito, si cuando reciban llamadas tocan el botã³n verde y no hace nada, no es que se haya daã±ado. tienen que tocar y arrastrar el botã³n verde hacia el botã³n rojo de la derecha para poder responder la llamada. perdã­ cantidad de llamadas y casi lo devuelvo antes de darme cuenta de eso. recomiendo este producto y al vendedor tj global. editarã© esta review si tengo un problema en el futuro. si no, asuman que todavã­a funciona perfectamente. /// he editado la review para aã±adir una traducciã³n al espaã±ol porque el producto lo merece .   product was not as advertised. shame .   wish i could give no star .   fit for its price and so so .   love. excelllent. bad. excelente. it's good. the phone was not as described. i ordered a factory unlocked phone, however it was an at&t phone that was unlocked. since i wanted to use it on t-mobile a few functions like the mobile hotspot were unavailable. no unlocked, the phone was locked. bien. gracias. good. exelente. the phone dosem t work. this is a galaxy s3 neo, just to inform you. a good phone,

poor batter life. arrives locked. it was having problems with the signal. great .   bought this as a gift for my teenage son. he absolutely loves it. great buy. excellent value for money .   very good. the phone is not as described, says it is the galaxy s iii is powered by a 1.4ghz quad-core exynos samsung vulgar and i came a dual core version also says 3g network hsdpa 850/900/1900/2100 publication and here in venezuela 3g with no lift none of the operators only 3 2g (edge) noooo recomiendooo should take the letter in the matter to stop cheating, this is scam lords .   good one .   i had to return the phone because this phone was not factory unlocked as advertized .   i love samsung. excellent purchase. either the charger or the battery or both is not good  .   thanks for nothing  .   i need you to give me a solution to my problem, buy this phone and is damaged, does not work, have the damaged card and charging unit. i bought a new phone and sold me one i recosntruido. since i buy bad wine .   super excelente. everything in perfect order;. xcellent product thanks. excelente producto. i really love it. good product. excellent. mut buen producto. excelent. it was a good shop. everything was good. nice product that my wife will enjoy .   excelente. great. hi, the equipment you sold me is not a galaxy s3 i9300, it is a samsung sgh 1747. the equipment doesn't permit the actualization of software, now it has android 4.1.1 and now android is using a 4.3. i need to use it in venezuela and i need the i9300 that you have publicated when you sell. please contact me. regards. when i plugged in the usb it didn't charge my phone. so now i'm having issues charging my phone .   i love my phone and the price was more then right! thank you amazonâ™¥. i purchased this phone believing that it would work as it is intended to. sadly, this is not the case at all. true the phone came in the original box with all of the necessary components it was supposed to come with. also true the phone was in "very good" condition and had very little to no wear and tear. the problem with the phone is that it simply dose not work. i am a t-mobile user and in the phones description it clearly states that the phone will work on t-mobile's and at&t's gsm networks. when you receive the phone you get a paper in the package that states: "for phones that are advertised as "unlocked", any gsm sim card from a compatible carrier and the correct size (micro sim card) will work in the phone". this is however not the case as my phone will not pick up the t-mobile network. i have been on the phone with a technical support rep from t-mobile for about an hour and the representative has told me there is nothing that can be done as it is not a t-mobile phone and he believes that the phone is simply dis-functional. he even went on to say that the phone is probably not truly "unlocked". every time i try to connect to the t-mobile network it tells me "unable to connect. try again later". maybe the reason the phone dose not work in my own opinion is because in the notification bar it tells you you need to download the new software update. the only way you can do this is if you connect to a wi-fi service. and even when you connect to a wi-fi service and try to download it will tell you this is not possible as your phone is "modified" (probably refering to the phone being unlocked) either way the phone did not work for me and i am very displeased so buyer beware .   i love my new cellphone it is very fast and confortable to use. so far, i like it. i've got a lot to learn about it. it has opened up a whole new world for me. i'm 68 years old and slow on learning but i'm enjoying every moment of it .   very good. excellent. excelent .   great phone .   good. excelente. this turned out to be a g3neo/i9300i. for some reason, usb otg didn't work on it. i needed otg for my application. i'm sure it's a great phone, otherwise; if you don't know what otg is then don't worry about it .   excellent. expected the international model 9300 is published, with my operator if you have 3g coverage, apart from this model has different characteristics of cpu and ram. instead received the model sgh i747. this cell coming whit bad battery, no charge, the battery have connect to energy if not cell is off .  very bad. its a good seller seller t he products he said t he products arrive on time no problems with nothing, thanks for all. i finally got the phone i wanted it works well easy to work. very good. some problem with the charger,but great quality. the sim card reader was broken up into pieces; therefore the chip or memory card couldnt work so it had to b replaced. it's a excellent product and it was on time. i recommend it a lot. ok. excellent  .   i like this product  .   100% satisfaction :). good product! thank you .   good cell phone, only con is it will start laggin after a few months of use, full reset and it goes fast again, sold it and got myself an lg nexus 4, no lag there. one of the devices doesn't have hebrew language. a great phone .   its unlocked and work perfect in my country. delivery on time. no used. excellent service and perfect product. i love it. decent .   very good phone. excellent. i bought this phone thinking it was the old new samsung galalaxy s3 i9300. but samsung is shipping the new "galaxy s3 neo". it comes with a brand new major update, android 4.4.2 and 1.5gb of ram. old glaxy i9300 only has 1gb of ram .   excelente. excelente sin duda alguna, funciono correctamente. i bought this product and after a month using it the network was down and the imei don't work any more .   it is broken .   great. exelent. good. that disappointment, i bought this cel for my wife in dominican republic think it's the international vercion unlocked, is totally false not unlocked nor the i9300, i had to pay for the release and not the original advertising not working on 3g i always buy here, but another deception like this eh thinking what to keep buying this type of product .   excelent, thank you. everything is good. but it does not work with handouts .   good. the phone came modified and thus can not be updated and modified as wine has warranty .   its good. excellent product worth what you pay for, i am satisfied with this purchase. 100% recommended excellent product. bien. a very good phone. would recommend this purchase .   very good. es excelent .   bueno. excelente. excelente. excelent products. phone very good, the delivery was quick and the phone is really great, i have no complaints, all very good. recommend buying .   i bought two of this cell for a couple of friends. the cellphones are great, easy to handle, great features. unfortunately one of the two weren't unlocked and i bought it to use them in venezuela so i had to pay extra to have it unlocked. gratefully it was possible and they work perfectly .   good phone. great seller. awesome product. excelente. love this phone. the product not comes in its original box and is not an s3 i9300. el producto no viene en su caja original y no es una i9300 s3 .   everything's good .   nice, phone for use one .   very good features in general .   i asked for a samsung galaxy s3 i9300 instead i have got a sgh-i747. i am not happy with this purchase .   exelente .   exelente .   bad phone. excelente. it's been just over a month that i have had the samsung galaxy s3. so far, it has been giving me a very good performance. it took me sometime to get used to the phone's many features. but i am sure, in course of time, it's going to exceed my expectations as i have heard so much about this phone and even the recent september issue of consumer report's rated this phone as one of the hot items on it's monthly favorite list. i guess this phone does not need any reviews from ignorant writers like me as millions already know that it is a very good phone and would be a asset any given day .   riz from nj. excellent, works great. no lo compren, perdã­ 300 dã³lares al comprarlo, y aãºn el vendedor no me ha dado respuesta. lo increã­ble es que amazons haya desmejorado el servicio al cliente y permita que estos malos vendedores estafen al comprador. espectacular gracias. i bought it for my wife and she enjoyed it. i only noticed i can't share the net using hot spot .   cell since i received asking software update all the time and gets crazy. is this a manufacturing defect or normal? does not seem right that this question software three times a week; actualization. the delivery of excellent product  .   excellent .   amazing thanks for your good products. the version i received did not support my at&t sim card or any other international sim's of mine which have subsequently worked in other phones. i even went to at&t to get a new sim and that did not work either. as i had to leave the us the day after i received the new phone, the issue remains a mystery and i can only assume the model was not 'unlocked international' as advertised .   the product is awesome .   good shopping. excellent! 100% recommended .   very good. your mileage may vary! i ordered this and received an s3 neo, the dual sim version. i was not expecting dual sim. i didn't even know there was a dual sim version. but as someone who travels internationally often, i am very happy to have it! the phone seems to work perfectly. my wife and i have had s3s for a couple years and we are very happy with its abilities .   good phone wanted to use with the new cricket but it's not 4g capable .  its a unlock gsm bu the internet would work with cricket service i really don't know y .   i like 4g lte phones. i like the s3, good feel, less glitchy than my s2 had been with the software updates. i had the boost mobile s3 until recently, when i switched to cricket and needed an unlocked gsm phone. my boost s3 had just gotten the kit kat update (android 4.4) and i loved it. but this new phone came only operating android 4.0 (as 4.4 just came out its a wee bit behind .  ). i tried to "search for software updates" but it said i was all up to date :/ i had to use kies to finally 'upgrade' to android 4.1. :/ so keep in mind these may not have the capability of software updates without rooting. one thing that wasnt a problem for me but might be for someone else was that these are described as being the i9300 but the one i received is the i747 (some different specs). essentially, read reviews of the specific seller you plan to purchase from, and know that these won't necessarily be the i9300 model .   unfortunately the phone came bad, does not recognize the sim card all the time, and when he finally reconose not allowed to call or use internet data, my mistake was not to try when the phone arrived and when finally i went to use the phone was bad, and the time to send it back as it had passed .   work good. i expected a samsung original quality phone, and they sent me a chinese copy, even it is very similar but when we see the details they confirmed to me that it was a chinese one .   bueno. this phone is a disgrace, cannot connect to any server, only just able to charge battery, totally dysfunctional, when someone orders a mobile phone it normally means they need it, surely a thorough check of these items should be done prior to dispatch and then noted that they are in good working order before continuing to disappoint customers, all i need is a phone that works in the usa with an appropriate sim and also with different sim in the uk, this has not been possible and i am still waiting for someone to call me back, this has proved quite traumatic, i lost my phone in transit to the usa and now three weeks have passed without a working phone, please do not deliver any further non-working phones to others as it is more than distressful,. excelent. excellent. very good .   very good .   good. excelente 100% .   ok. good. this phone was recieve broken and damage,the screen broke it no

excelente telefono .   muy bueno. love my phone, i've had it for almost a year and i had to buy three batteries, and go to technical service. the charger cells had to be replaced twice .   and it looks like im going for my third visit .   this phone freezes a lot now. the charger was an international charger do i had to buy a replacement charger. oftentimes i have to take battery out to restart phone . i have the phone earlier now for 5 months and have had to replace the battery. very unhappy with this item and regret purchasing it from amazon. i would replace phone again within the tear but will purchase from a retail like best buy or walmart .   excellent .   excelente. i'm from venezuela and i just wanted to let you know that this is a chinese version of the samsung galaxy s3 .   and it does not work as it should be .   please do not buy it .   defective phone! wont make calls. ppl cant hear me and i cant hear them and after a min the call drops. i want a replacement. bougth 2 phones from the same seller and one is not workin. dont buy cells from amazon get them at a store, they may be a bit more expensive but your not gonna get a phone from a shady seller. the phone is not the one i buy, i sent a phone chinese manufacturing, i am very annoying is the first time something like this happens .   equipment is rebuilt to insert my sim card is not recognized, the team is uncapped in technical service and have the same parts with rust, i'm from venezuela and i can not return it i feel cheated. nice cellphone, smartphone sometimes heated, sometimes it is slow .   excelente. muy buen telefono. very good product. i recommend it .   excelent movil, nice order and product .   it is a great phone still. good evening , i want to tell my story about this product; i bought one s3 approximately in february , at the beginning it started to work perfectly with my sim card for one of the operators in my country, but past 2 months it stops working with the same sin card , it didn't want to recognize the sim card or any another for others operators. so i decided to bring it to the operator movistar technical service . over there they told me that my phone belongs to another person , that is for that reason that my sim card stops working with the phone , they assured me that my phone was one stolen one for another person , that the only manner that l could prove then that was my phone is bringing the phones bill to them. so they proved that phone didn't belong to me , so movistar technical service couldn't help me and i had to bring it to another technical service by my own count . once technicians in a different place opened the phone they realized that this one was opened before by someone , but that was not possible because was gonna be the first time that it was going to be opened , so when they showed me the opened phone to proved that they were right , there were parts of the phone that had been injured and damaged before . so i not only paid for fixed it inside it i also paid for make my phone works again with sim card , with a different imei . so i don't recommend this place for buying this type of phone because this people sell reconstructed phones and send them anyway  .   i spent a lot of money buying the phone , bringing it to my country , and extra money for fix it !  .   is good. the phone has shut down and i can't use it again. i bought it last year, so i only used it for a year. am very much disappointed. the phone is not working is remanufacturado offered as new. excelente .   excellent .   good product .

bright display. unfortunately, it will not let me upgrade the firmware .   i am quite pleased with my phone to date. one warning to possible buyers - when i charged mine for the first time and it booted up all of the writing was chinese! you can understand that on this side of the world it is completely incomprehensible as that type of writing is not related to latin and hence difficult to decipher. luckily my husband actually had an s2 and found on his phone the language settings and so we were able to find it on mine. once the language change was made all was well. i would imagine that many persons would have experienced the same situation. possible help could be as simple as a google search and/or youtube to ensure you are able to get things going. it works great so far and i have no complaints .   muy bueno, excelente, gracias. perfect equipment .   excellent .   i used to have a galaxy s 1 and then i got this phone. it has tons of awesome features and works great. this

(brown box bonanza) i want my money back, i do not want this orrible defective phone .   the screen is very, very bright and crisp, fluid and is something the team color is beautiful .   excelente. didn't like the phone wouldn't run on the 4g network. ended up buying a galaxy s3 model sch-960l from straight talk. best phone i have seen for the money .  couldn't find a new one found one on ebay like new and had no hitches .   phone stopped working no replacement or return available terrible product and seller .   all good. excelent. perfect replacement for my damaged siii. even came with a european charger adapter .  which was great when i traveled to italy this summer .   does not work with any sim card .   i love it. i loved the product i recommend, although the magazine did not seem very good quality. excellent all well. this is a very good smartphone i've been using. having used it for almost half an year, i am very satisfied with how it performs! it has high-tech fashion design, and it has an almost-perfect audio performance. the quality of resolution on this phone's screen is incredible! whenever i am reading e-books, watching short movies, or playing all these cool apps i downloaded from play store, i am always never getting tired of doing these things repeatedly due to the high-quality display of the screen! however, there are also some downsides i would like to point out! despite having 8 mega-pixel for photographing, i am sometimes disaappointed with the results when i take picture--unless i am taking picture in a place where has sufficient light and clear views. also, the battery duration seems a bit of a problem to me. i always need to re-charge it everytime i am back from works, even i am not using the phone most of the time! in conclusion, this is a masterpiece designed and made by samsung, i would consider it almost 100% perfect phone compared to most high-end phones. 5 stars for this lovely high-tech phone despite some drawbacks .   very good .   it worked perfect in venezuela (movistar/digitel). excelent .   excellent articule. the best brand. nice phone. i bought this phone as a gift and such a low price. the person i got it for is very happy with it .   great phone, stable and fast. camera is fairly good, audio quality is ok (was better in galaxy s1). using cyanogen mod android (no stock rom) because samsung's roms are always slow and heavily loaded with their crap .   the battery doesnt even work. the box it was open, phone is not a brand new it was used. i donâ€™t return the phone because a most to leave the city and i donâ€™t haw a time for that. very bad and disappointed. excelente producto. i ordered the galaxy s3 but unfortunalty whenever it went to standby mode - it was frozen and had to be restarted. i tried to look in many forums how to solve the problem and didn't figure out. on one forum it said it might be a motherboard problem. i shiped it back and got my money back. finally - problems happpens from time to time. i hope when i buy another one i will not face the same problem again. excelent. work very well. excelent. excellent .   excellent .   excellent .   good. very good. downloaded very fast and is not the battery, i would like to make a change  .   as i contact?  .   i did not like the phone because nothing works well. its was good for 1 year and the battery died. forte. the samsung galaxy s3 smartphone i bought was suposed to be new and factory unblocked, but it wasn't. i went to a samsung booth at a best buy store and the samsung thecnician said that my cellphone is false. it's a shame .   i' m very upset! now i'm a owner of a false samsung smartphone! what can i do now? amazon shold ban this kind of company. is there anyone from amazon that could do something to give me what i bought? i will aprecciate if i could have an answer from amazon .   superb .   in less than a year after having this phone the battery starts overheating and shutting down the phone. really dissappointed. i would recommend this bcuz i bought this for my cousin's birthday who is in d.r. the product arrived safely and nice packaged he said he loves it a lot hehehe and he told me it even charges with solar energy really? wow im amazed and he also said it woks fine thanks u a lot seller u made one very happy person in my country dominican republic :). excellent article, the best price and delivery time is very fast recommend to all. got exactly as listed. love this phone. had a htc inspire and will never buy a htc again. samsung galaxy all the way .   excellent article like this is published without any problems or faults and in good condition and good working recommended an excellent product. upon receiving the phone, i charged it for the required time. after a few days i noticed that the battery could not last for a whole day without being recharged at least twice per day. after a while i could charge only once per day. well in less than five months i realized that the casing of the phone kept falling off and i could not figure out why. it was only yesterday i decided to take a real close look; only to realize that the battery had begun to swell, forcing the casing off the phone. i have reported same to amazon and is awaiting word from the seller. will update .   good seller, i am sure it's not the seller's fault, it just stopped working after 3 days, the screen went dark, but it still rang. they were nice enough to refund the money with a hefty re-stocking fee .   got what i wanted. meets my standards regarding what i would like out of a phone. samsung always does it for me .   i purchased this galaxy s3 i9300, not researching the word in discription "international", big mistake on my part. the phone would only work with a 2g or the edge networks. i wanted 4g .   i received my order on time as promised the phone is in good condition when i receceived it and it has all the features that were descrived im now using it and it satisfy my expectation the only concern i have is in the battery that only last 24hrs even though i've already enabled the power save tool can you give me some advise on that.all in all its a good buy thanks. rip off artist, fake, horrible product .  seller has 206 negative reviews selling refurbish samsung galaxy s3 19300 16gb as new and amazon allows him to continue to sell on their platform. bought the phone feb 6, 2014, and have been having problems with not ringing, dropping calls, static and difficulty understanding callers, paint peeled off all around the phone edges, almost 50 % of the bottom half of the screen is burnt with a black circular marking making is almost impossible to visualize the keyboard to text, the back of the phone get very very very hot where i can only hold the edges. i feel ripped off and the seller is doing nothing to correct this problem, i am taking the matter further to a higher authority if i do not get a resolution to this problem. no one should pay $355.50 for a 'new' phone and get a "refurbish phone" .  it not able to perform many of its function after 2-3 months. i 'strongly would not recommend' this buyer to anyone on the planet and amazon should remove this company before others get ripppppeeeddd off .  buyers beware .  stay away from this seller .   the cell phone when it came to my hands the keys "back" and "menu" did not work. i had to take him to a technician who i remedied the problem. finally the unlock of the cell is by software which i understand that it is illegal. should be the unlock by imei .   the charging port appears to be defective, such that the phone cannot be predictably charged through the mini-usb port. the software, for some reason, cannot be updated and simply reports to have "failed," each attempt. the phone provided by this crashes regularly and is unstable, unlike the identical model i bought from a cell phone company (which was stolen). although this item came in what appears to have been authentic packaging, i suspect that i may have received a repackaged item. my phone contacts were initially improperly linked (different names simply inseparably linked to one id), then were completely deleted. i am unable to sync the device with my other accounts. i feel as though i was defrauded in this sale .   other than the fact that the white plastic gets chipped up and therefore looks beat up, it works very well .   very good service, phone as expected. it works fine with the service providers in mexico. getting familiar with it. good phone. very good. i choose this phone as a gift for my brother and he likes it very much .  although i heard some negative comments about factory unlocked products from amazon but in my case it was more then ok .  and the galaxy s3 is a nice android version .  and i have found s4 got no big difference in compare to s3 .  so i strongly recommend to choose this phone .   i think it is a good product as the quality justifies it 5 stars if i value nothing more to ask thank you very much. very good sale .   it is the best phone i've had, i loved it. all right it was no problem, so long his box was all excellent phone, fast, great, totally recommended. get everything right in the box, all accessories in its sealed. the phone arrived earlier than expected and the phone was to my mothers liking, however i may have just ended up with a faulty charger; no kool. i put it to charge and only heated up and not charge sold me defective i think that i cheated. seller wanted to rid this product. although it worked, sensor of phone (bottom left)doesn't work well. this is the same side of the phone where the main call button is! problem 2, the port on this phone doesn't work, therefore the battery can't be charged. i bought a new battery and tossed the old one thinking this was the problem. seller then wouldn't take the product back. i bought a battery charger port so seller refunded the amount for the charger. very displeased. problem 3. thus is an individual. it's far better dealing with people who have products vs one product. buyer beware .   the model purchased was not the model which came. i promptly returned it. quality assurance needs to be much stronger here as i'm not sure i will be using this site again to purchase a cellular telephone. very disappointed .   i am very disappointed claims to be an unlocked cell and when i get my country was not well, really not worth trusting a provider as this was my first purchase and i pass it, i'm sad because all they said to me that in was reliable amazon buy. apparently the phone is used. it only added plastics to make it look like they new, but has many scratches on the casing. i am very dissatisfied with the product, however, does not send you the computer because it is a very tedious process from venezuela. take into account their equipment providers because they appear to be second-hand when they are really "new" and over time will get negative ratings. pd: i don't speak english. so you may have trouble writing .   phone wasn't unlocked properly it was still running on the at&t program. i was kinda disappointed with the fact that you said it was unlocked international version. the phone i bought stopped working in a matter of days. my trouble was enhanced by the fact that i trusted the supplier to provide quality checked phones. (and hence i sent it to india as a gift.) now i have to spend around 70$ to return the phone via fedex from india to us to return it .   this is a review of the samsung galaxy s3 i930016gb - unlocked international version no warranty sold by texaselectronicsdistributor and fullfill by amazon. i bought this phone to give to a relative,outside the usa, as a gift for when i visit. i read some reviews about fake s3 international being sold by vendors on amazon. but i hope that being fullfill by amazon i would get real one. if i got a fake i would just return it before my trip and get my relative another phone in her country. when i got the phone, i open the box and everything look brand new and said s3 international i9300 including the label on the back of the phone where the battery would go. i thought great and took it on my trip. when i powered it up for my relative and check the phone the boot screen showed i9300. i check about phone in the settings and it showed the device was i9300. but i notice that superuser was install so it was already rooted, which was unexpected as it was a brand new phone. it was only when i was trying to install a custom recovery to install a custom rom and fonts, that i realize it was fake. when i was in download mode to install the custom recovery, it should have also said i9300, but it said it was i747 which an s3 but not the international one. i google it and others seem to have this problem. it seems to be that someone remove the internal motherboad of the i9300 and replace it with the i747 variant, but keeping the external case of the i9300. then that person rooted it and install a custom rom that deceived the user into thinking it is a i9300 in the setting. my trip was about a month, so it is too late to return it. the custom recoverys for i9300 failed to install properly, but the custom recovery for the other s3 variants which includes i747 worked. i didn't want to risk bricking the phone so i left installed rom alone. on top of that the battery was faulty and had to be replaced. it is her first smart phone so my relative kept it anyways and seem to like it. just be aware of fakes. if it is already rooted when you get it, it is probably fake. reboot into download mode. if it doesn't say i9300 it is fake .   i bought a new article (s3 i9300) but i received a used one. when i opened de box i noticed thar the phone had a screen protector. someone else used this phone. i consider unnapropriated to offer a new item and received an old one. additionally, i can see some scratches on the back cover .   very happy. this products is liked. i am satisfied with the products purchased. thank you very much. very good products. item exactly as described by the seller. perfect size and light-weight phone. it works just fine so far though no warranty. i liked it and i hope it continues to work for long .   i will choose 5 stars because i liked i would recommend this to someone yes i like this product is good. the cel never worked for three weeks and then i cannot charge the battery i am so angry about this. i am very satisfied with the phone it is fantastic .  after a bad one came from another company, this one came and i am very happy .   up to now i think is a very good smrt phone! despite the battery last less than one day without using it that much .   i got this for my mom for mothers day and she loves it. i havent heard her say anything bad about it. such a great price too .   i sold a phone with imei shows cloned because in my country there are otrto phone with the same serial. the cellphone looked like used in good conditions. also comes with some garbish aplications like rzeczpospolita, skychash, e-kiosk which are not easy to uninstall .   is the best phone, my wife is very happy for this and the quality is excelent. the phone is complete. this phone its not unlocked. when i purchase this phone the description was unlocked. i need a response to this .   samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international, only work good for a year, now present failed with the wifi. maravilloso telefono estoy encantada con el. it is excellent, i received on time and the quality is great work as itâ€™s required and i will give 5 stars, itâ€™s just wonderful, better impossible, i was checking many different and similar of this one and i couldnâ€™t find someone like this .   i meant to keep the phone, but the buyer did not fulfilled his obligation by sending the order in time. so i end up got fed up and retuirned it immediately i received it .   stay away of oakland wireless. they sold me a junk with a defective chip and lifeless battery. i bought it as a gift. i guess i was another one who payed for their scam. star rating required for the review .   it is very good cell phone. all is right. i am very happy for this buy. i can recommended that .   i bought this phone in august 2013 and by early october, the touch screen was not working, 30 days after the warranty. keep stealing money friend. techgiant. very good phone, at least now is fine , i like soo much mi new phone thanks . good good. phone is locked. doesn't work at all. also the worst customer service ever. they never answer and when they do answer they do it in a bad way. like if it is a pain in the neck for them to fix your problem and provide you with a good phone. never buy here. again the phone is still locked and the worst customer service. he love the phone and it is now an appendage to his person how did he manage before with his me-too .   the phone has worked 3 days and then died. as i am in argentina now, to send back the s3 to usa is as expensive as the phone. i feel cheated .   it is good cell phone, all as expected before order. i hope so it will work good in next period .   very good. short version: the phone wont work unless you use it in europe or you have an european friend from whom you can borrow his sim card and do a 5 minute call (no joke). otherwise the phone will not work! long version: i didn't had much knowledge about cellphone locks and that sort of stuff, that is why when i saw on this phone being sold as "international unlocked" i though it would work internationally and it would not had any kind of locks. i was wrong. and also the the questions the seller replied to customers enforce my theory that it should work: --- q: does it work in argentina with movistar? sep 22, 2013 a: yes --- unfortunately the seller avoids to tell that there is a new lock being implemented by samsung that prevent to use the phone directly on a different region from where it was intended to be used. the phone being sold is the european version of the s3-i9300, this means it is intended to be used with european carriers. this lock was implemented by samsung to prevent illegal imports of their products, as it seems to be the case with this seller. on the box there is a note that says: "european model: this product must be activated though a sim card emitted by an european carrier ( .  ) to use the sim cards from other regions a five minute call must be made previously from an european carrier." when i tried to use the phone with a non-european sim it would just ask for an unlock code, and if dismissed it will just not work as a cellphone. i contacted the seller by email first (the theoretical support email address that came written down on the box), but after three weeks the haven't yet replied. after three days i tried to contact the seller via the customer service form on amazon, and after several emails (each response took 1 day from them, even if i replied 30 seconds after receiving their response) they admitted that the cellphone was region locked. --------------- original response from vendor (codes and phone # replaced with x): good afternoon and thank you for being so patient with us as we investigate this issue for you. after an extensive investigation with our technician he has informed us that this phone may be region locked. however, he was able to provide us a code for this phone so that you may attempt to unlock it with a code because for some reason the imei did process and the code is as follows: please inset your non accepted sim card in the phone and when prompter for code please enter: xxxxx. if this is unsuccessful please pull the battery and restart phone then enter the code: xxxxxxx. it will say unsuccessful then please enter the code: xxxxxx again. please note that, region locking is something that samsung has started doing recently and we understand how this can affect most of our customers and our business. we are willing to do anything to make sure you are a satisfied customer as we do value your business. our technician has informed us if this code does not work for you, the only other route to this problem would before you to root the phone. however, i also understand you are not in the us at the time anymore so it would be more difficult for you to return the item to us. if you can find a local technician that can root this phone for you in order for you to use it we will fully reimburse you the cost of this operation. once again, please accept our sincerest apologies for the troubles this has caused you. please advise on how you would like to proceed, we are also open to any suggestions you may have for resolving this matter. please contact us if you have any further questions or concerns, you can also call us at xxxxxxxx 11am-6pm mon-fri est. thank you and have a great day. --------------- of course non of the unlock codes worked. the other method they suggested was rooting the phone, unfortunately rooting the phone does not automatically unlocks the phone because it is something totally different, rooting the phone only gives you root access. to unlock the phone via this method you need not only root but also an app that actually removes the region-lock. at the moment when i bough the phone there is no such a thing for this particular model, it does exist a hack for the galaxy note, but not for the g3-i9300. nevertheless i rooted the phone and tried to unlock it with the galaxy note method without luck. after this unsuccessful attempts i contacted the seller again to return the phone, 2 weeks later they have not yet replied. luckily enough there was an european friend who kindly lent me his sim card and we did a 5 minute call and the phone was unlocked. but care must be takes as samsung says it can re-enable the lock after certain time. so unless you plan to use the cellphone in europe, or have an european sim card that can use to do a call, do not buy this phone as it will not work. the seller should inform this to the users .   no se recibio. please, my team not the is i expected need a prompt response or give me the money in a tank in an account that i have in miami please answer caracas-venezuela. the phone works very well until now, but the box gives the impression that it has been opened before, since the paste had a label had been removed and another was placed on another side of the same. the phone is not holding charge. not pleased with the phone.its freezing when u in apps. not at all happy. i cannot believe it. i began use of this phone on tuesday 6th may 2014. on monday 19th may 2014, less than two weeks after i began using this phone the screen went completely blank on me. nothing triggered this, the phone has never fallen or anything. the screen simply died. i now have to pay $400 ec dollars, more than half the price i paid for this phone to have it repaired. i am furious and need to be compensated for this great loss! further more this phone is not 3g/4g compatible and works at snail speed i am completely dissatisfied .   this is my first smart phone and there is a learning curve (i couldn't figure out how to answer my first call). the phone is light and has a large clear screen. the camera is better than i expected. text messaging is easy because the keyboard is very responsive, especially when turned sideways as that makes the keys bigger. i haven't used many of the phones features yet but i think we are going to get along just fine .   muy bueno. "unfortunately, i bought a samsung galaxy s iii as a new product, but it is not new, it is "refurbished" because the internal card belongs too another samsung model (sgh - i747). besides this, it is not international unlocked version either because the box says: "only for uk country" and it just works with at&t telephony. i will really appreciate a solution from the seller about this situation .   i like my new phone works very well, as you described it is released and i could use it once with my sim card .   we took the phones down to mexico unused and easily connected them with the local system, todo esta muy bien. the product is not indicadoen depiction comes with locking regional network to buy it and turn me dpidio network unlock code  .   not recommend. the cellphone arrived in the time as expected, but i weren't unaware the type of seller i had to deal with. i will first tell you about the phone. mid range device with huge marketplace of apps waiting to download on it. i'm pleased with the look and feel of this one, handy and comfortable to carry out in your pocket without no one notice at all, and sometimes even yourself. on the other hand, sometimes android gets laggy and clumsy with some commands, taking a few seconds to respond my demands and i realized that my windows phone managed performance in a better shape than this s3. another issue with this device, and the most difficult one, is that although in the title of the publication said the device came unlocked turns out it wasn't, and at this point is when my nightmare begins. i purchased from a different seller than amazon with apparently good rates and reviews but the customer service until now it has been deficient and i must say i'm very upset about their treatment with my complain about my s3 locked issue. they told me that samsung are shipping devices unlocked since 5 months ago only for using under european and north american soil and it wont work properly with carriers from latin america, africa or asia. i use to travel a lot because my job requires it and i wanted to try some new different and taste what everybody told me about the marvelous world of android but i couldn't do it because of this matter. therefore, and with a great effort, i made a deal with this seller and they will pay the rooting process in order to unlock the cellphone to all regions. i will post back when that happens .   it's didnot work international it says unlock but if you try out of country they say we have to download software and it never worked. is a very powerful and pretty phone. meets the expectations. is a top line cell phone, meets the expectations and it has 4 bands, to use worldwide .   great phone. great service .   fulfilled my expectations. i highly recommend this kind of accessories later i will continue buying accessories best regards eduardo araujo. great phone. good evening, the team sansumg s iii is not released to buy have not been able to use since i am disappointed when i buy check me leave to say that any operator (unlocker). i really do not c porq this step if the descriccion article clearly states that it is released and finds bands that appeared with me in the characteristics thereof .   . this phone not only met my expectation, but exceeded it. it is very easy to use and is built rather sturdy .   product is good. easy to install and provides good protection to the phone body. cons - there is a line showing up along with the side which sometimes steals the looks. compre este cel q era liberado internacionalmente y jamas fue asi funciona solo con movistar y no era el gt i 9300 si no el 747 no los recomiendo y vienen sin audifonos y pare de contar para no darles mas detalles! q buy this cel was released internationally and was never so works only with movistar and i was not the gt 747 9300 if not not recommend headphones and go without having to stop and not give more details .   el telã©fono no estaba desbloqueado. son un fraude, ahora tengo que pagar que me lo desbloqueen. the phone wasnt unlocked as international version. now, i have to pay fot it. this people are a totally mess .   resulta que selecciono la compra de este equipo en condiciã³n nuevo y resulta que cuando recibo el producto no es totalmente nuevo, los equipos nuevos samsung de fabrica vienen con una etiqueta negra en la pantalla donde se menciona el nombre del equipo y sus resaltantes caracterã­sticas. este equipo solo venia con un protector de pantalla, y la versiã³n internacional es vendido para amã©rica y el equipo en la caja decã­a version europea, asi que ojo con la compra de estos equipos asã­. it turns out that select buying this equipment in new condition and it turns out that when i receive the product is not entirely new, new samsung equipment factory come with a black label on the screen where the name of the team and its salient features mentioned. this team only came with a screen protector, and the international version is sold for america and equipment in the box said european version, so eye with the purchase of this equipment as well .   phone is not factory unlocked. won't read 3 different sim cards i've inserted (from different carriers). i tried emailing and never heard back. had to pay somebody to unlock the phone for me or else it would only be good as a paperweight .   this cell phone is great, i am very pleased with the product, it's really good. thank you very much for everything .   this phone came to me defective. take you to review and tell me it's a copy. battery that is not used samsun. to buy another tube. exigo it changed me. i buy a samsu cell iii or copy. this is not the right phone they advertise. it is the at&t us version sgh-i747 .   supuestamente venden el i9300 y resulta que internamente es un sgh i747. excellent .   i am not pleased with this order, it has clear evidence of water damage nor was it unlocked as described .   it has been working great since i had it. i am also buying my fiancã©e hers as soon as possible. i would not have purchased these and then had to go through the hassle of returning them if i had known that info .   good product. samsung galaxy s3 i9300 16gb - unlocked international version no warranty .   a good one has almost everything basic u need. is an excellent product, i recommend it to everyone so they can purchase it. approved and is of very good quality. the device i recieved was not international unlocked, it was european, locked. what a pain and a shame, considering i live in venezuela .   purchase a galaxy s3 and i get everything as expected, no tube delays but the team came to me in italian language and europe i am from venezuela and when i insert my micro-sim says "no sim" i acquired the team because here said it was unlocked. help me please .   i bought this device from this seller: winda usa. it was supposed to be a brand new unlocked s3. it doesn't say anywhere it was a refurbished or used item. at the beginning it worked fine, but later it got stucked, frozen, had problems with the wi-fi and the battery didn't charge fully. besides, the battery went down very fast from 64% to 10% in 30 minutes. first, i thought it was the android version. many blogs talk about it in the web. but, the android version what the device came with was a correct one. so, that made me think it could not be the software. then, i decided to take it to the technical service. my surprise was huge when i saw the device's motherboard with glue in several parts. the technician obviously told me it was not a new device certainly. i felt angry and scammed. also, he could check that one of the charge connectors was loose and probably that was the cause of my problems with the battery. he welded it and fixed it. however, my problems with the battery continue. i will try to solve it using other methods with the software as i know it is possible. but the main fact here is that i thought i had bought a brand new device, not a used one or a refurbished one. i wrote them and i had no answer from them. maybe that is the reason why this seller put in the title "no warranty". now, i see it. i do not recommend anyone to purchase this item from this seller. be very careful and don't let they fool you as it happened to me .   i have ordered this phone about a week and i received it today. on the box it reads " do not accept if seal is broker or tampered" but my box has a broken seal. i'm not sure if this is an original phone or some chineese made duplicate one .   exelente. niceee. the cellphone is new but it's not unlocked, i paid for the bands to be release and the 850 does not work i had another s3 and no problem, but this one isn't what the description says it doesn't work with all the band it says it works. all good product came in perfect condition and at the right time and the excellent quality and a fair price. all good product came in perfect condition and at the right time and the excellent quality and a fair price. it's wasn't like description says .   i am really angry about it! i payd so much money after i take the phone to unlocke it. nice. att got it to work with them. so they can do it if you get the right person to do it .   sold as the international version, when the phone arrived in brazil i found it doesn't work here. had to return it. double check to make sure it works in your country. buyer beware .   this cell phone was very well. it came in a nice box. i'm so glad i got one. i really like this cell phone features. thanks. i choosen this phone for the rate between price and spec. also you will find cheaper covers than others phones. do not receive g4, but in argentina this service is not available so pay for a phone with g4 and not be able to use it is not and smart choice .   it's good for the price, work good, the speed is good in the wireless and the red too has many accessories for the phone. i wanted to upgrade from the samsung galaxy s2 and got this s3. it's much faster and i like the blue color. since it is the international version, you have to choose the country and language in the initial setup. otherwise, you will get german. after that, works like a charm. much cheaper than the u.s. version. not sure why. i was going to buy this same phone at walmart and decided to hold off and check amazon first. the one at walmart was over $400! this was about $300. save $100 by purchasing an international version. it uses a micro sim card. if you do not have a micro sim, you can cut your regular sim card to fit using a template(that you can order from amazon.) so you do not have to purchase a whole new sim card .   i did not work in costa rica, i say it is locked to costa rica, and i can help with this problem that i have .   the phone is great, love it .   however it is not as advertised. i am in nicaragua and it's not working. i wrote to the support email on the package and got no answer. i have not been able to unlock it. i asked if i could get the name of the network and country from which it is in order to buy an unlocking pin code and no feedback. very bad customer service .   the product is ok, it is just what i needed. i added one more start because the seller added the screen protector for free. thanks .   is a lack of seriousness as you are irresponsible and they were wrong in the delivery of the package and nop want to get responsanble for this reason i ask you that it resolved my case or sue you as my box nothing has come at a time contact the company and there is no charge diber any employee identified by the name of venegas i demand that it resolved my case. and i need my money, this case also happened with my brother and it was resolved and subsequently sent your package .   i feel really cheated this phone is not like being unlocked. brought no separate charger head. i really do not recommend a waste of money. for the price i paid for this article, it is expected. i recommend if you need. if you want more quality is best .   i bought this phone for my brother, so i really don't know how good or bad this phone is. but he seems happy with it. my phone it's absolutly blocked, i can't used in my country. the phone ask for a pin code that i dont have it and then doesn't take my sim card. i have to pay for unlocked. i think the phone was refurbished, the battery has to be replaced to times in 1 year. sorry, i have a really bad experience .   excellent device, working perfectly in brazil. recommende for sure. recommend would definitely know how to buy the site to deliver in brazil. no issues of any kind at all cause its working smoothly and i enjoy using the samsung galaxy s3 i9300 16gb. excelente. i love my cellphone, its a really good product and it comes in any language you want .   100% happy .   good seller. the phone works perfect it been three weeks now and no issue. one phone is in a different country and no issue. as far as the quality of the phone itself i like it very much. only complaint would be the battery life. you can drain the battery dry within a couple of hours depending on what apps you are running. so long as you do not leave apps running in the background the standby and talk life of the phone appear good. was able to take my consumer cellular sim from old phone and use it right away. have had no problems with getting good quality gsm signal where i'm located and i anticipate overseas traveling will be no issues .   exelente producto rocomendado 100%. for sometime now i have been wanting to change my.phone. from a distance i have been admiring the samsung galaxy s3, and thought that this was way out of my league as i am technically challenged. anyways i got the phone and i have not regretted my decision, â¤â¤â¤â¤â¤. it's simply amazing .   i'm absolutely in love with this phone. so much better than iphone. everything about this phone this perfect. wonderfull. this phone not is the version i9300. the seller never solve the problem. the usb cable does not work. the phone was used .   this is a nice phone and works perfectly. most of the cell phone carriers do not know how to setup an unlocked phone and insist you must purchase one of their phones. we were able to find a carrier that provided us with a sim card and the phone is working perfectly. good price, delivered on time, and works great .   i was initially very pleased with this phone. performance was quick and reception was clear, which is very helpful sionce i am hearing impaired. however, after about four month's usage, i started having difficulty getting the battery to charge in the phone. although the phone signalled that a ubs connection had been made but the charge cycle started only intermittently. eventually i lost the abiliy to charge the battery in the phone. i bought what was advertised as a samsung external charger and i9300 battery. the battery has a different model number and does not fit into the cavity inside the phone because it's about 1/8 inch too long. i was able to charge the eb-l1g6llu by using a rubber band and spacer to wedge the cell intothe charger, but decided to return the set. so far i have been unable to locate a new, genuine samsung battery for the i9300 internaltional phone, so beware if you think about buying this phone. becasue there is not warranty, you are out of luck if a problem arises after the return date .   great phone! it's really amazing this samsung galaxy s3. i absolutely recommend buying this smartphone. and the best thing is that they brought it just in time. the product is not as described, is not international version and european version is not unlocked, i had to pay extra in my country and use it to unlock. very nice  .   i love phone so much but i dropped it once and the screen cracked and now i have to pay $240 to fix it which is almost as much as i payed for it. basically get a good case. wonderful device meets all expectations perfect size cristal clear screen super fast great looks powerful cool to have and a whole lot more! tank you. i bought this phone to replace a broken s3, and i was really excited to see an unlocked version on amazon. unfortunately, this phone is gsm, and not cdma, so it won't work if you have a verizon phone. if you have t-mobile or at&t, or you're international, you'll be fine. also, don't actually expect one day shipping - the company took a full 24+ hours to process the order once i placed it .   i bought this phone in december,2013 and in next two months it stop charging. when i took it repair shop i was told that it's charging point is not working and it can not be changed either because it was already repaired earlier. so in net shell i received a phone from amazon which was defective and already repaired. i am very disappointed with my whole experience with this phone and the kind of seller amazon has .   the unit supplied fast .   it works well .   recommended .   thw sheeping was bazing, the unit came in a sealed box. it works perfect in israel. i like it .   excellent. the shipping estimate wasn't right and it was almost a month waiting on it. it was really worth the wait because it really works very well .   beware! this product is not manufactured by samsung. it will transmit text but not images - my whole purpose in buying it. samsung says that these "international versions" are not manufactured by them and so will not provide technical support. f w fallon. 3 days after i bought the phone it felt down and the screen was broken right away, other than that samsung galaxy has always been my favorite. excellent .   100%ok. excellent .   100%ok. 3 weeks later i never got a phone my requests for a refund have been ignored ups says straight trading can only give me info straight trading says i have to contact ups i'm tired of dealing with a lack of communication i feel disrespected and cheated out of my money now my husband wants to get our attorney involved over $269. i am very dissapointed, phone supposed to be new. i will return it right away. need to do it urgently. as the product description, i is an unlocked international version, but it was not real .   it is locked, i try to unlocked via samsung and they told me it is imposibel because it is an italian version! i felt rober .   excelente compra .   it was a knock-off. it is not the real thing. do not order if you want your phone to work .   pretty good works as should it. fast shippment no worries much better than i could imagine recommended if you need a cell phone. the product is ok and of good quality, original. i am happy, excellet price. i would recommend these to a friend. thanks,. this phone is advertises as an unlocked international version; didn't work after inserting a t-mobile sim card. this phone is lock to at&t. samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300is a excellent mobile phone. that great buy and have all tools are necessary to be online with technology world. everything i expected. but i had one before this current one and it suddenly "died". repair costs were to high, at least where i live. â¿why buy the same model? because of all the people i know that use this model no one except me had this kind of "error". and new models are more expensive. this one works just fine for me .   it is fantastic as i expected and i recommend others to buy it. it is a good deal. i like it .   excelente producto .   this is a complete disaster i purchased a new phone for $336.70 and got an old used phone, had it hooked up it's not working properly giving a lot of trouble even to turn it off is a problem have to remove battery this phone freezes up all the time, it's a piece of garbage .   i like this phone, it was very good for travel being unlocked. samsung always makes a solid product. buy with confidence .   what can i say, this galaxy iii is a replacement to my galaxy s (first generation) it came clean with (android 4.3 jelly bean) and no visible signs of scratches or damage, i was able to drop in, power up and log on in just minutes. i love it and so will you .   dose nothing but freeze up on me all the time. i have to take the batter out many different times doing the day. i can not stand it. the. well the hubby loves the phone. just wished i could of bought a warranty with it that was a good one. bought it from global mobiles. it was obviously refurbished. no imei or serial number on the package. it does not have the upper left blue light that illuminates while you're on the 3g or 4g. inside i found a statement from the seller that reads: "thank you for your purchase from us. unlocked phones do not come preloaded with internet and mms like network branded phones. here is a small manual how to set up the settings for at&t customers. if you're using another network (t-mobile), please check the internet option for the settings you need to enter. this phone does not work with sprint or verizon" end of qoute. really .   how do you know unless you opened it and tested it? still sold as new, right .   lol. it is gt-i9300 which should come factory unlocked with all options. i doubt it's a chinese replica, this is why seal is removed (glue residues are obvious on the package and collect dust). that is fraud and must be investigated by amazon in order to keep their reputation. phone must match description online and of the unlocked version from factory. im in venezuela, the phone is absolutely brand new , it works perfect, it comes with all accesories, i recommended 100 o/o  .   im having trouble with the phone . about 3 weeks after i got it i started to experance trouble with it .started to tune off and then back on by itself until i jyust stopped using it im not sure of what to do with it i thru away the paper wok away if u could help me please let me no . this is the first item i ever bought on line. battery does not last anything, with low use lasts less than 6 hours that's normal .   with another charger usb charging does not pass a certain point. i bought this phone during my vacation in colorado, as my old mobile phone was damaged. the phone was delivered with a loose contact on usb connector. so that after one week i wasn't able to charge it any more. as i happened to be in asia two weeks later i brought the phone to some guys who do cheap mobile phone repair. they told me that the main board was not new! it had definitely already been repaired before. i looked at the board myself and i guess they were right! as i live in germany, i did not send the phone back to us so far, but i complained via amazon. no reply from the seller after almost two weeks now. i can not recommend this seller .   just what i need it. the s3 is now for the price a good choice if yo need a good ann not so expensive smartphone. when i got it installed a few games the next day the screen goes bazzar it has pink colors and lines like it has been hacked. blutekusa sold me, i liked the phone was excelnte, came in excelent conditions, but it came locked when the title tells that it's unlocked i had to pay for unlock it because the phone is pal (european) it worked only with europeans sim card when they known that i'm in amã©rica (venezuela) i hope that it wil not happen when i buy another phone .   the phone is perfect, just that i was not liberated from manufactures, pedi helps the seller and the responses were not effective, i had to pay $ 50 for unlocking. the phone is he that described in the page? because i have read several negative reviews that the phone is not the described. please. grateful for your response. gregotio torres. i got this phone for my teenage boy. received the item in new condition, every thing unopened. i set it up for a h2o unlimited service for $30, and works perfect. the sim card for h2o got it from amazon just for a penny and free shipping. i did not have any problem to set up the phone and the service. my son is crazy about this phone and we think is the best phone ever .   i liked the phone very much. it is easy to operate and to view. i would tell my friends to buy it .   everything seems fine. however, the battery is not good. the delivery time is off by one day. but still. this is one great phone .   i can not give a concrete opinion about this produccto since not reached me per'm sure it's excellent. l b. this is one of the best devices i have ever had, and i am a bb lover. i would never have owned a samsung, but my son gave it to me for my birthday. i must say that after i got use to the operating system, i really began to appreciate what the phone offers. the screen is magnificant, big and bright. the audio is very clear and i must admit that i have slight hearing issues. i now use it for everything (phone -of course-, planner, alarms, mp3 player, office work, social networks, etc.). i have had it since december, and have not had any problems. i highly recommend it .   the seller that i bought from sent me a phone that was not unlocked and therefore did not work with the phone company i wanted to use. the shipping was slow. the phone was in great shape and i love the samsung galazy s3; it is one of the best phones out in the market. i just wish it was the correct phone. i recently purchased another samsung galazy s3 and love using it .   received ahead of time. great! no manual in english. product appears fine and would like to make good use of it. my grand-daughter will help me figure it out since she has an s4. hopefully i'll be able to receive a manual from amazon or shopebest .   this phone is very good. it is high quality, the screen looks great and sounds very good. the size is perfect and the camera is very cuena. i am very happy with this purchase. 100% recommend this product. very easy to learn how to use. has all the features i need. i would recommend this phone to everyone .   this phone is the international version i9300 and it is a awesome phone, i only have 1 issue, when i received the phone it came in the retail packaging but the sticker that you see that says do not accept this item if this seal is broken, well the seal wasn't broken but i could see where there had been a sticker placed on top on another so idk if that was done because the phone was already opened and they resealed it with another sticker or that's just the way it is, also after i got the package open and pulled the phone out i could see that it had already had a screen protector already stuck onto the screen, now idk if all these i9300 new phones come with a screen protector already installed on the screen but mine had one already stuck on it. that's pretty much everything i can say about the phone, so beside those 2 issues everything else was perfect and i cant complain. one last thing i am going to contact samsung and ask them if this phone does come with a screen protector already installed coming brand new out of the box .   good night the reason for my post is to wish congratulations to the way they move their labor hambiente and hope they continue improving through. the phone sucked the batter was swollen after three weeks and no replacement can be found since it is not a standard standard phone battery .   good i am writing is to know why me sending a samsung galaxy sgh-t999 s3? the phone did not bring user manual. the headset is of poor quality. the box does not bring the description of the contents of the cell from the back. i need to explain to me. good smartphone, the only complaint is the battery, poor life battery, doesn't last more than 3 hours. need to be improved .   the phone was unlocked, so i simply took it to the store for the plan i wanted. they inserted a new sim card, and it works great. came with us and international plug for the charger, so that was a bonus .   love it, no other way to describe it. had it delivered to new york area but live in europe and it was no problem at all .   mobile excellent. i think that is one of the best phone that launched the samsung. we recommend to anyone who has a good mobile phone. mobile excellent. i think that is one of the best phone that launched the samsung. we recommend to anyone who has a good mobile phone. product excelent, good , is product of quality, recomended for all the people, buy with securety, 100% recomended, after the final. i loved it, it is better than expected, very pleased with what i bought, perfect in every. graciess .    .    .   the seller said the true, this is a original oem by samsung siii - i9300 - international version, factory unlocked - 100% brand new in box full recomendation .   bien. i love the phone, i just wish the volume was a little louder i can hardly hear it. other than that i love it. doesn't charge and when it does in less then 15min it says low battery .  :/ and that really upsetting and disappointing. i have it for over a year until i lost it and i must say that i highly recommend this product. this product totally met my expectation. @jhonatanugas. the phone came in perfect physical condition but is blocked. in the phone get the following message: enter the pin unlock network sim card. i need an urgent solution to this problem, otherwise you would be selling a fake product and that is punishable by law .   it have no problem. the only thinkg i'm not satisfied with is that samsung s3 have some irritating property that make it hard to use, illogic .   i'm upset by the product, i first came to the second damaged screens phones are chinese are not samsung original galaxy have external antenna and no equipment original s3 brings, exigo i reimburse my money since q ue phones do not work and are damaged. i love this phone. it came as promised. the only problem i had was setting it up for my at&t network, something that was accomplished by going to settings, mobile networks, apn, new apn, and then entering the at&t setting already in my wife's phone. any at&t store should be able to do the same thing for you for free in less than 5 minutes. excellent service .   phone came on time and in good condition, but took over six hours to charge and the charging last only half a day.after repeating the process over a few days it still has the issue. i am left to believe that the battery is not good and now have to purchase a new one,hopes this solves the problem. so buyers beware .   well the phone is what i expected. there were a few dents but that's fine. this is a ripoff compared to the moto g .   these phones are used, lost a lot of money buying from this buy, amazon take this seller off there ripping off people, said new but its used an cost the same as new phones. very disappointing an hurt about it, dealing with amazon for years make me wonder what next to do. take this buyer down an beware people there spammers .   i don't like it because you can't update it to android 4.3 and you don't have radio i just hate it if i know that i wouldn't buy it. and don't forget if you want to buy some thing dont forget to read the comments. the product i bought with the order number # 002-5767992-7866665 did not fullfil my expectations due to the fact that it does not work properly. it has very poor signal, and in most cases, whenever i want to talk to someone in a phone call, they do not hear to me. this is why i am doing this claim to you and i want to know which solution are you going to offer me. i do want to make clear that another product with the order number #002-4076089-4078627 (same phone) works well. waiting to hearing from you soon, regards, eduardo varini. a great phone for a great value, my advise is to wait alwais to buy a smart phone, unless it be a iphone, the price will drop in a 40% about a year of the release date .   your comments were "good evening, i would explain to me how it is possible that the computer that sent me is inside chinese. a copy. i was informed by a service technician to check the same and this raises no 3g (the case) is a samsang externally. worse operating system this is the sansung siii difente offer no indicates that the computer is not the original samsung. the usb cable is not a tablet this team, i want a solution to this deception, or fraud and that i was supposed to buy a samsung galaxy siii original. not a copy .   this is a great phone. love the camera and the features. i've since upgraded to the s4 active. love my samsung phones. have had the phone for 2 weeks now and really like it. very nice clear screen. size is bigger than what i was used to but still fits into my pocket fine. phone must have originally been headed to france or eastern canada because all the instructions were in french and the charger was as advertised and internationl (european) type. usb cable still works fine with other usb plug-ins we have .   i've had the s2 and loved it. time to upgrade a little so i chose this. had it activated in mexico's telcel network with no problem .   excelente producto .   the phone has never disappeared came to the company fresh! i had already refunded the money but there should be a return message indicating when such a situation occurs, because if one does not demand money back because the item never arrived then you lose that money and the item .   choice of the recipient (gift). hence, cannot tell why she made that choice. furthermore, i am unable to get her opinion. this phone is advertised as "4g network region based". according to samsung, the i9300 product is not a 4g phone. it does not include a 4g chip. the term "network region based" is, therefore, meaningless, as the phone does not have 4g capability. only the i9305 product is equipped with a 4g chip. this is a clear-cut case of false advertising by "manipulation of terms", with a high "likelihood of confusion", and can, therefore, be the object of civil enforcement. potential customers should be aware of this "manipulation of terms" before placing their order for this item to avoid the hassle of returning it to the third-party vendor .   we bought it and it is working perfectly in mexico with telcel (mobile phone company). the only thing we had to do is change old sim card for a microsim. besides that everything is great .   first is doesn't come on time, also, it comes all in spanish, and i went to get it prepaid, they will not do prepaid on it anywhere. also, it does not come with the sim card, so you can not even use it. horrible< do not order this .   this is a review of both the galaxy s3 phone and the vendor, straight trading. first about straight trading .   before buying this phone i read many reviews and was afraid to buy one. so many reviews were critical of vendors with statements like "got a refurbished phone", "received a chinese knockoff", "phone would not work right out of the box", "no warranty", etc. i emailed straight trading with a few questions and they answered me within minutes, all to my satisfaction, so i ordered from them. the phone arrived very quickly and was everything straight trading said it would be. it's a brand new phone in an unopened box with 1 year warranty. i am very pleased with their service and their honesty. now about the phone .   i have been using it without a sim card for a week now just to get used to all of its features. i'm very impressed. i was able to transfer all of my contact and calendar info from a different phone brand easily. it does much more than i imagined and the software has not faltered - no crashes or restarts. my only issue so far is gps navigation. samsung says you can navigate without an internet connection using only gps, a feature i am most interested in. you basically store the map area of interest in cache and from there on it's supposed to work using just gps. i have been unable to do this unless i have an internet connection at the beginning of my route to select the destination. after the destination is selected and a route is plotted, you can then disconnect from the internet and all works well. but, you must initially have an internet connection in order to select the destination. without a connection the map works and it shows your location and nearby points of interest accurately, but you can't select a destination and navigate a route. i still have hopes that this can be resolved but after two attempts with samsung online chat, i've gotten nowhere. i'm about to install a sim card and go on the at&t network. if i have any earth shattering news i may come back and amend this review but other than the navigation issue, everything else has been working just fine. very satisfied with my purchase. 2014 apr 06. update. i have been using the phone now for several weeks and am very pleased with its performance. other than the gps issue described above, all has been working flawlessly .  no crashes or unintended restarts. it's absolutely amazing what this phone can do. it will take several more weeks to discover and try all of its features. battery life has been excellent; just don't turn wi-fi, bluetooth and other power hungry features on when you are not using them. i highly recommend this phone and the vendor i bought it from .   beware, i bought this phone in october and two weeks ago the 4.3 update was downloaded ota and after installed the phone was not able to make or receive calls anymore, it said not registered to the network, so i contacted the seller and he told me samsung would cover the warranty ( by the way the no warranty ) was not there when i bought the phone, any way i callled samsung headquarters and they told me samsung does not cover any samsung phone bought through amazon, so here i am with a useless three month old samsung s3 sold through amazon by an irresponsible seller who only wants to sell phones with no support to buyers, that is money talk. good day. all good, but the phone was not unlocked and i had to pay extra, i was disappoint . thanks you. replaced by a nokia lumia 920, 1 month after the purchase. the android os is too complicated compared to the windows phone 8.1 .   i bought this for use in brazil and works perfectly well. it was a good shopping. i have had any problem. perfect .   this is a wonderful phone. i use it at the university and it is very useful. fast, nice, good apps .   this product is fake, it's not original and you will have many problems with it. the software is very bad and you can't update it or even replace it ith new version. simply get away from this one .   i am unable to use this phone on my sprint network. even though it is a international phone sprint uses no sim card. good afternoon, i am writing to inform you of the problem with the cell phone to buy him, i presentouna failures and lead to the samsung authorized service and cell phone review found that the imei code that has the tag attached to the barcode when cell phone is not the same imei code that has registered the cell phone, and for that reason does not guarantee them. samsung told me that i contact you to me that my problem solution. i appreciate the solution of my problem as soon as possible. you are a company responsible for the sale of all kinds of product have to be equally responsible before these problems. thank goodbye to you. i love this phone. the phone works perfectly but unfortunately in canada it does not work with wind - network. i had to change my network to fido. so if u live in canada take note of that .   amazing phone but might not work with you network. seller is highly recommended. saturday i received my phone that was purchased on 23/12/13 which said it was unlocked international version, i have not even been able to use my phone with a wireless network operator in venezuela. i would like to help in this regard .   the team did not show the features offered! 9300 series i indicated and i turned 535, indicating unlocked which resulted not true! i had to come to venezuela and cheated with this team. i received it just the other day and i love it already! great phone, and in great shape! i couldn't have asked for a better one! my only concern is the usb cable that was sent with it goes into the phone with difficulty and feels stuck when i try to take it out. i'm sure it'll go away or loosen up after a few times so i'm not too worried. i would recommend this phone to anyone, in fact i already did. to my dad and my brother. great phone .   it really helps me with my daily taks for work and home it has a great speaker. i cant get enough of this phone .   although i like the phone itself, i'm not happy with the fact that this was supposed to be a new phone and clearly it was not. the back of the phone has scuff marks on the back. it was also sent without a english manual. i just got it but i'm not sure yet if the battery is any good, it is taking a very long time to charge, so i'm hoping i don't have to return it .   granted, the product is received in top condition  .   brand new factory and all its accessories. the phone meets all the expectations i had and also satiface all needs that led me to make your purchase .   is not unlocked. it is a lie. 20 days ago i purchased this phone. and as i was saying the description was factory unlocked. to my surprise, the phone comes to my house today (venezuela) and seeing the box said "european model". can only be used with sim cards of european operators. now i have to spend more money to unlock the phone. my advice is not to play with the product description or money of the people .   very good phone but they take time for shipping and they sent me a european charger.but i am in love with this phone really worth it  .   don't like there is no way for me to upgrade the software. add less then a year like the s3 but this one .   first of all, this international version does not include a charger that can be used in usa or mexico, it will only include the charger that seems to be used in brazil. the vendor sould include in the package a conversor or a generic version at least that can be used in other countries, or at least speicy this clearly in the product description. second, i didn't like the phone, the plastic parts are very fragile and the material is poor, but this is not particular of this version, this happens qith all s3. my screen broke after 2 weeks without even falling or receiving a hit. i kept it in a front pocket of my jeans while driving my bycicle and it broke just from the movement of my leg .   seriously, how much pressure can this phone take .   "the phone is not genuine, they sent me the chinese version and i got only one month with this phone and the battery doesn't charged anymore, i'm from venezuela and i can't find overhere this battery cause is the chinese version, it's a crap version not original, i am very disappointed with the seller. if you want to buy a samsung galaxy s 3 do not chose this seller." they sold me the chinese version .   great device i used , leter i changed to s4 because im a tech person, but my wife still use it and it just works great .   the phone was everything as described & even better. unfortunately i didn't do my homework & i couldn't get it to work on my straight talk service & i returned the phone & the gentleman was awesome he refunded my money no problem & he offered to help me get it working but if any of you have straight talk you know what i mean .  there customer service is awful. i believe this guy is a true gem & i would highly recommend him and his phones again. thanks so much .   i bought this phone as a christmas gift for my son. i can not updated this pone. the seller told me that take it and ask for help in the store. the store updated at the beginning, on december 26, 2013. now there is a new updated and i can not do it .   it is an amazing cell phone, it was better than i expect, the only problem was that it wasn't sent the cell phone manual but for everything else its great .   the cellphone has bad the battery because i cant fully charge it (100%) . i see details on the surface of the phone like it was broken .   im not happy whit my order .   this phone when i connect to a pc this show me the phone as a sgh - i747 .   and i have some trouble to update the firmware .   like the title says, the phone doesn't work well internationally. it takes forever to send a message, a lot of failed sms sends. i will not buy a samsung phone again .   bought as a gift for someone. buy it thinking it was original samsung but left very disappointed to see that it was nothing more than a cheap copy which to buy original price. lo compre creyendo que era original de samsung pero quede muy decepcionada al ver que no era mas que una copia barata la cual compre a precio de original .   i'm new to buying phones on line - so i didn't know there are national providers whose chips won't work in some phones. ask your provider before you buy .   i ,couldn't wait for my phone to arrive, there is only one word to describe it "amazing"exactly what i was looking for.this phone is perfect for someone with bad eyesight i have had this phone for almost a month without any problem .   it's a nice phone, but it's no the international version, it has rooted, for that four stars, work well in venezuela. it was the wrong phone for my carrier . i'm with verizon & that phone was made for at&t . had to return it & pay a restocking fee . i really lost money on this  .   if you are looking for free phone that can work anywhere and you are into the edge og technlogy just go for it, shop best delivered this phone in just one day dispite of the fact i had chosen 5 day standard shipping i put in my order on the 24 feb at 11pm got shipped on 25 and delivered on 27th, it was more than i had expected in terms of speed. am loving it, it came with french manual, usb, ear phones. excellent product worked well, really recommend is a good productoa an unbeatable price, i am happy for this purchase reallmente if needed would buy another product equal .   i've used for almost 2 years before buying s4, which i did just because i got it in a really good deal, was already really happy with it! great phone .   after having my phone just for months i realize that it is a fraud it dosent even have an original rom (rom stock) from samsung so a can not update it through ota and it says that it has ben modify so i cant do it by samsung kies either, as if that were not enough the battery got damage and when i bought the replacement battery it didnt even match with my phone or course because it is not a samsung galaxy s3 wich i should imagine since the first day because the phone its white and it came in a blue box and without headphones so summarizing fraud fraud fraud .   liers .   i have major issues with the phone and i am out of the return policy. i have a friend that has the same phone directly from tmobile and doesn't have the issues i have. the issues i experience are 1) drop calls. don't use this phone to make calls 2) battery dies fast. i thought it was the apps but i reset it and now it will go from 50% to turned off in a minute. 3) the screen is starting to die and flicker. i wouldn't not recommend this phone from this place. they may have got a bad batch or something but it is terrible .   this is an amazing phone to have. the picture quality is wonderful, lightweight. screen size is big for viewing. user friendly. very nice cellphone with the best functions of android so it is a cell with caracateristics very fast and the only bad thing is that it doent work with 4g. when i received this product, the box's seal was ope .  so, i was thinking this is not new phone some kind of reason .   but the price was ok .   this phone was very fake, on the back of its case it said 16go instead of 16gb, i wished i had picked tup on that as soon as i bought the phone. also it has charging problems, and it cracked from a fall of only two feet. now i dont even know if i can send it back and get my money back .   very good .   excellent article, very practical, very fast modern yy. from all points of view is excellent i recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing it. even though it is states that the product is factory unlocked international version, you fail to state that this is an at&t phone, that comes with sever un-removable at&t which are useless outside the us (and indeed to anyone not working with at&t), and that the tether option, which is crucial for me, is blocked. very disappointing. full disclosure should be practiced .   this phone is not truly international version  .   when i took to india, it prompted for a firmware upgrade. after upgrade to android version 4.3, it cannot recognize the mobile network! sim lock error .   mobile operator blames samsung. do not buy. i asked several times will this phone work with sprint .   i was told it was a sprint international factory unlocked phone. i only needed to activate it! wrong, wrong, i took it to sprint it's not a sprint phone, sprint said its a useless phone can't be activated. sprint does not use a sim card. sprint went on to tell me they see so many folks buying on line phone that are not what they claim there suppose to do. i really hope this is not the case with this phone. i want to keep the phone if it will work with out too much hassle. i have called best buy they sell sim cards for $30.00. if that solves the problem, i will be keeping this good looking phone. when reading the model and id #'s to best buy tech's they said it wasn't a sprint phone either. i realize that! loud and clear. i just want it to work with my sprint, usa carrier. i hope, if i have to return this phone, i can with a full refund on my credit card. i need a phone, i use my phone for business .   kingwood, tx realtor. i'm a new user to the smart phones. it's an easy to learn-use phone. i love it-what else can i say .   i brought a samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone from zaarn which is fulfilled by amazon. but it is not better than other seller. i recieved this phone and can not even call people .   what kind of phone it is if it can not even make call. so i returned it . so annoying and ruin my day .   i bought this phone back in february 2013, in november it broke down and neither the seller, samsung usa nor amazon cover the warranty in the us. the only warranty alternative they offer is to send it to the uk of course paying roundtrip shipping costs. totally insane .   so please be aware of this fact when buying a samsung phone through amazon .   omg i can't say enough how much i love this shop and how great the products are that they have sent to me. i bought 2 phones from them and both have worked perfectly. thank you so much .   the phone is nice i took it to mexico for my girlfriend on valentines day and it wasnt unlocked she has to spend 40 dollars to unlock it. i was deceived by the seller. buy an samsumg siii, i9300 and sent me a samsung sgh-i747 s3. now the cell phone is hurting me and venezuela can not repair it because it's not i9300. i feel cheated. excuse my english. excellent quality. this product is perfect, it has all characteristics indicated. i have long in use it, and work correctly .   second time that i ordered this cellphone and i'm happy with the result! is the same that is in the picture .   the product is excelent. the only thing is about the battery but, nothing to do about it nowadays .   no regrets. 1- i bought the phone with the option of 1 day for delivery, i received the phone five days after the purchase. 2- as the product description on the website, i requested the unlocked international version, however i received a european version. 3 - the box that contained the phone appeared to have been previously opened, or reused. i completely dissatisfied with the service and product delivered. i like that phone. i used for 8 month of purchase for $450 and lost it. i lost that phone unfortunately last january in metro. someone do like it again and doesn't want to return it to me after found it. but its ok because life goes on. i do still want that phone back cause first i love it and second it was for me a huge cash investment without contract. in con i will said that the phone starting have some earing trouble after 3 months of use. also the battery after 4 months of purchase doesn't last at all and early before i lost it i cannot have conversation without put my phone on loudspeaker. the micro do have problem like the battery. i hope that my new user will fix that problem and pray for me to have money to buy another one. again these were delivered as promised and was what it was suppose to be. new phone and works great. no problems of any kind so you can be at rest .   very sleek and good looking phone. handy and lesser weight. easy to carry. fast and perfect. everybody will like this phone. good seller. i bought this phone because it was advertised as unlocked international but the phone was not unlocked as advertised. i had additional cost to unlock .   works as good as they said it would i would order from them again. i won't waste a lot of words here since it's last year's tech, but it's a nice phone. whatever android phone you buy, make sure it's unlocked, but probably the nexus is better value for your money. that's what i'll get when this one is dead .   i bought an unlocked cell phone and i revceived a locked ccell phone, now i have to pay to someno to get my cell phone unlocked to use it. this is truly a life changing technology experience. such a smart device. i have recently replaced it with the s4 after losing the s3 in a taxi after 2 years of use. this is a great investment and worth every penny for the upgrade from the i phone. replaceable battery and expandable memory just to start any comparison leave apple in the dust not to mention android 4.3 and waiting for the 4.4 any time now .   this phone works but it is not an unlocked phone. it is a verizon phone that happens to be an international version (gsm). it will ask you to register to verizon and attempt to reach your verizon account every time you want to access your contacts, for example. it does work and you could patch it with a custom rom but that kind of defeats the reason of buying an unlocked version. this should be revised by amazon and seller penalized. it is false advertising. i gave it 2 stars because the phone works and it was delivered quite fast .   i purchased this item because it was certified by amazon but i was so disappointed to find out that the battery is useless . i will not recommend this to anyone my battery gets flat less than 30mins and it take 24hours to charge. its really sad that i am not in american now i would have returned the samsung galaxy x3. it's good i liked. the phone that i received from tj global was defective. it had water damage and was a european only version. since this is a product review, i feel bad giving a product a bad rating because of a bad personal experience based on the failure of the supplier, but i also feel that it needs to be known that you are taking the risk of getting a bad device by ordering it through this page. tj global listed this device as, "new, in box". when i got the box, it was made to look as if i was getting a brand new phone. it was sealed with factory looking stickers and everything. no where on the box did it state that the phone was used or refurbished. the one thing that it did state clearly on the box was, "european version only" in large letters, and then a long explanation about how the phone will only work with european sims cards. when i opened the box and got the phone out, the first thing i noticed was noticeable scratches on the case of the phone. i was put off, but i thought, "oh well, as long as it works." i took it down to at&t to get a micro sims card for it and that is when the service rep showed me the water sensor in the phone which indicated that the phone had been in the water. try as she might the service rep could not get the phone to accept the at&t sims card. the galaxy s3 may be a great phone; i don't know. what i do know is that i would never order an s3 through here. i understand that a mistake can happen, but to advertize a used damaged product as "new in box", and then try to disguise it as a new product is outright lying and false advertizement. and this is not to mention the unbelievable stupidity of importing a phone to the us that can only be used in europe! i guess the person who packaged my phone must have been blind or something. the bottom line is, this kind of thing should not happen on amazon.com. sellers like this should be banned from selling on here, unless of course amazon does not care; in which case they can take part of the blame for my experience .   exelent. i ordered this phone for my daughter following my own experience with the s3 mini which i have been using for about ten months now. after using it for a few days she just could not understand why she had to wait this long to have such a phone. each time i asked her about the phone's performance and features, she just says "awesome" .   is supposed to be a phone that is released for any carrier but has not released it had to pay for his release. i'm so upset with the seller of this phone. this is not the international version. i was not able to return it as i bought something for another country, i dont live in the us, i wanted to use it on my country and i was not able to do it. i dont know why amazon have not blocked this seller already. they are selling something that is not what they described it .   it is very disappointing that the phone was offered as new, but it is very clear that the phone is a refurbished(used) one. it even came with the screen protector(not the sticker of samsung) and clear marks that somebody had used it before. i am traveling this week, so i won't have time to wait for another phone. i really don't recommend this seller .   i got this phone 4 months ago and eventually fell in love with it. it stopped without a warning .  such a waste of money .   excellent job. muy bueno. excellent product comes a time in excellent condition very responsible supplier, we recommend 100% what you for your kindness certify. i've always had cheap cell phones and i decided to finally step up and get a phone that had some memory for apps which is what i want one for rather than it's phone capabilities. i wanted to use the phone along with a good app to control my camera and this one looked like it would fit the bill. i am not disappointed. this is a really nice phone with a good sized screen for live view with the camera and the controls the app afford me. good buy. came as advertised. at&t had a couple of problems getting it to hook up to their network, but they finally got the job done at my local at&t store. the s4 had come out, but it was the s3 i wanted and i'm very happy with it .   this is actually the second one i have owned, the first having been drowned in the washing machine by my mother while on vacation. this one is actually better than the first one, because the first one still had some locked features, while this one was totally 100% unlocked. it fits my chinese sim card (well it should i just took the sim from one phone to the other) and because of the software, it saved all my contacts. works great with wifi and acts like a miniature computer great for someone on the go and can't pull out the other one to check emails regularly. as an english teacher in china, all the apps are great for helping me translate words or meanings that i would other wise need a clucking dictionary for. easy to use and unlike my previous 1st gen galaxy this version rarely leaves my hand when on the move. i would buy this phone a million times over .   i order an unlock phone and this phone was not unlock as it was advertise, i am not happy about that but other than that the phone is great. the phone does not work properly, is flawed reception, the people who call me can not hear me and hear delayed, is said to be a phone unlocked and at & t, does not allow updates from kies, so i have a old version of android, besides say it is a i9300 and sgh-i747 when connected appears, for these reasons i do not recommend this product .   excelente. i got this phone and i have it like 9 months and i am very pleased that is why i can recomend it to anyone who likes samsung. i brought the samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone from esaving which has a high rate. i trust the rating in amazon and brought a new samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone from esaving. however it send me a phone that is used, broken and can start and shup down by itself. i even need to pay 5 dollar to send the back to the seller. the experience is awful .   dont buy it from esaving which even does not have explanation for me. it ruined my day .   soooooo disapointted .   on the description it said (new) and what i received was a blend of i9300 and i939 .  reconstructed openbox! very dissapointed. excellent quality to .   i had to get a replacement phone for my previous samsung s3. most naturally i bought another s3 eventhough the s4 was available. great functionality for an affordable price .   my comments its what i expected so its completely satisfactory and serves my needs arrived on time and operating as expected nathan. everyone is raving for the samsung galaxy s4 but i chose this phone for pricing reasons. its been a good buy, the phone works excellent .   this is the worst phone i ever bought. i had the phone for 3 months before it went bad.tried getting it fixed and was told its factory fault. the screen just goes blank. a big waste of my money .   the phones that i purchased didn't come with its original chargers. and i didn't received any notification that it would be like that. buenisimo. i feel cheated and disappointed. i get the phone to my country. and it hurt me 2 months. cell was white came in a blue box, the battery is not a samsung original. in my country tell me that the phone is chinese, a clone. i have no possibility to fix it because the battery fails. i do not recommend buying this product to the company .   i ordered this phone after my iphone 4 decided to give up on me only 3 months before my upgrade. received the phone on time, in sealed packaging, fantastic condition, and exactly as advertised, except for the small, but incredibly important fact that it was not, in fact, an international factory unlocked phone, but the at&t version. they are still getting three stars because this would be a fantastic buy for any at&t user, and because they have been very helpful and friendly in the way they handled my refund .   it was not international version factory unlocked .   it was at&t. and the box was open. this was no mistake .   it was cheating .   you would improve you service on check the ware that you are selling, the phone came with defect on upgrade of software but it's ok. my husband loves his phone, battery last a lot and phone is super fast, he is an android guy and would buy it again. good cell phone, with excellent performance. i recommended. i am very happy wiht them. good camera wiht good resollution and excellent photos .   i bought this phone last month. i thought i got the real model, but they sent me the european version. till then i was fun cause i could use it. but the battery seems to be fake. it can't give a a four hours. i must constantly charge my phone, otherwise it's useless. i think now i might need to buy another battery (waste of money eitherway!). it is a great device. it didnt get 5 stars because some of the apps aren't available in my geographical area .   i bought this phone to gift it to my brother in uk. on receipt on order the phone box had the description which matched exactly the product description. shipped this only to realize that the phone inside is low end model and locked for att. this is cheating. on raising a complaint i am getting poor response on this. please don't with this product and the vendor .   is not a f .   international unlock version .  and i am f .   mad because i don't f .   live in usa to return this f .   shiet .   nothing else to say .   i bought one and waiting for two weeks to get it. it works one day only and the second day the screen was black. i have to return it. i am disappointed in the phone. the returning is easy. thank you amazon. the galaxy s3 allows you to do everything you would ask for a phone and more. this particular version has a really good processor that makes it run smoothly with almost every app you get. i would definetely recommend it .   excellent phone, very fast, perfect size, nice looking. cannot think about anything i do not like about this phone. even the price is good .   they sold me a refurbished phone of course i should say after they take the responsibility but the damage was already made. the galaxy is the best phone on earth, i am an it person who works with all phones on daily basis .   the samsung galaxy siii and s4 are the most powerful phone we've ever tested, full hd screen is the best in the business. its plastic construction is a drawback and some of you might find it complicated to use, but there's no question that it's a seriously it is an amazing phone .   e phone- samsung galaxy s3- i received is not an original one, it came in a box, what is different from the original, it was some android box, it had unfamiliar chinese software on it and not those softwares the real galaxy comes, the picture quality is not good enough, less quality then an original has and when i tried to get a case for it, it did not fit. that made me sure the phone is not an original one. the phone did not came with the proper manual either. i feel i was deceived since there are many orders placed under my name i expected a more honest treatment. i'm wandering to stop any business with you. my first 'smartphone.' had asked friends/family what they're using. this one kept coming up. did some research before buying. have been very please with its handling and performance. it's fast! only down is the low battery life. have to plug it in every other day (even with bluetooth off). otherwise really enjoy it .   this phone is great, it offers a lot and the screen is incredible. bought the phone unlocked and put in a sim card from tmobile .   perfect. this is not an unlocked phone. phone locked after first update. the seller global mobile was unhelpful and refused to replace the phone. after this experience i would not recommend anyone purchasing anything from global mobile .   the phone is just the right size so far no complaints. working well no freezing. only thing manual. need to change weather from centigrade to f' .   i have bought 3 of these over the last 3 months. the first two from open wireless. they worked out of the box, although they were in french and i had to change the language. then somehow lost their unlocked state after an ota update. that is bad. i contacted the sellers and their best advice was to return it. i had to return both of them. then, i recently later ordered a third from winda usa, it was already already updated to the latest version and unlocked. it was also in english out of the box. i believe the inconsistent experience users are getting are because of different sellers than rotate on amazon. winda usa had the best experience for me .   the phones were purchased to be sent to barbados. every thing went well with no problems .will recommend them to anyone .   is not the best phone but the screen in perfect for people with thick fingers .   is fast but not 4g in my area .   i have ordered a samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone with 2 years warranty from shopbest to gift it to my younger brother . i have paid a lot for this . once i received it , i just check it and it was working fine. then i kept it for some days. after 3-4 weeks , when i tried to power on my cell , it was not working at all. i tried to contact the shopbest and requested them to replace it . they told me they won't because it was an international version cell and it will not covered in warranty. now i have submitted it at a samsung customer care center , but they are saying it will not work because it's motherboard was a faulty one and it will not work. my friends ordered the same from other sellers and that was working fine from them. i have lost all money because of this seller. they don.t have any value at all for their customers. please think 100 times before buying any cell phones from shopbest . i will update more about my cell phone very soon .   very good cel phone and it is exactly what i was waiting for. i am totally satisfied with this purchase .   i love this phone. it works perfectly fine and the camera is really good. i am so happy to have it :). bought this phone as a gift for my wife and boy did i hit the spot! she loves it .   after my initial dislike (she paid that phone more attention in the first 48 hours than she paid to me), i started to see how practical the phone was for her .   great buy. i didnt get it yet and i have been waiting forover a month. i expected to find it on fedex, but when i put the tracking number in it said item not found .   excelent. i have serious problems with my phone .  sometimes i can not use it because the touch-screen is blocked .  and i also have problems when i want to update the system .  it does not work .  anyway i bought it when i was in the states, two months ago, now i can not do anything .  i am in romania .   the phone is just amazing, it was reached to my place on time, i strongly recommended to everyone. cheers. omar. i love this phone. works well with my carrier . although i didnt realize that it uses microsd sim but that was easily fixed by my phone company. not one fault to this phone. cant take my hands off it .   cons: - it's restarting itself sometimes when using the 's memo' application. - the charger cable does not work properly, i'm using my old samsung galaxy usb cable for that. pros: - the sensation of having a galaxy is pretty unique, way far better than apple .   this phone is a must buy .   i purchased this phone, because ,it was cheaper, than t mobiles same phone. i got it unlocked and t mobile gave me the right sim card. i do like this phone .   my phone came as new as it can be. it came sooner than the expected time frame and ready to use unlocked and working nicely .   was exactly what it said it was, came sealed brand new, all parts were included in the box, even the headphones, im happy with the purchase. i bought one galaxy s3 for my wife 2 months ago. though it says it is unlocked, it is in fact totally locked .   i returned it to worldwide distributors and now they want to charge $179. i have contacted amazon, and hope they will honor their reputation, because worldwide distributors does not honor theirs. they did recognize that the product was misrepresented on the website, but donâ€™t care about the customer! buy the phone, which is great btw, from a different distributor .   great came as advertise works well up to now,only thing gets quite hot after long usage,& battery runs down fast other than that i love it. i ordered this phone from two different vendors, juniper mall, and asavers. juniper mall sent me the actual true "international version". asavers sent me a package stating it contained model: gti93000, however, when i opened the back of the actual samsung galaxy siii, the label inside the phone cited sgh-i747 which is an at&t worldwide ready gsm phone programmed to operate on the at&t gsm network along with all the bloatware which comes with an at&t company contract phone. the tip off was the clear plastic protective cover which stated 'use the microsd card included in this box' and there was none. clearly this phone was unlocked, but it is absolutely not the 'international version'. i am writing this review as a warning to other customers so they may hopefully avoid this issue and be aware that some vendors are erroneously advertising their phone as the 'international version'. just because a phone manufactured for a usa company is considered 'worldwide ready' does not make the phone the same as an 'international version' which will not have the same crap ware/bloatware as the usa cell phone based phones being issued by usa cell phone companies. this phone will be going back and we will repurchase from another vendor. if you purchase, be sure you check the model number on the phone and google it. do not trust the outside box labels .   dear, i am very disappointed about the cell phone i received. the phone is not new, it is a used phone. the phone does not work for network 3gsm as stated in the notice, it only recives 2g signal, and is very slow. i was unable to make it work, the phone is a bad product, it does not work, is not new, i want my money back please .   finally the phone arrived today. in a box with a broken seal. it said it was a phone for use in europe only .   there is no way to contact the seller to ask if there is a phone that can be used in south america. my only recourse was to contact amazon and they authorized a return. what a disappointment .   worst purchase ever! i returned the phone because it has some things in chinese, and the worst thing is that it wasnt unlocked! i tried to send it to get unlocked but the versiã³n was different and it wasnt possible to use the phone in ecuador  .   i even compare the batery size with other s3 that work perfect and this one was smallest! so i start wondering if the phone was a fake s3! anyways i returned it because it wasnt what i order and spected! you better think twice before purchase this! hope this is helpfull to someone. i have paid for unlocked international phone. i got locked phone. i am getting message as sim network unlock pin. fully recommended, arrives in perfect condition, exactly as described, and as aparecee in the images. i'm from venezuela, and it works great, is released white  .   it's just perfect. very excited and pleased with this purchase. recommended. buy it at the store shopebest. thank you  .   i took the phone out country and so far everthing is great. the service and fast shipping were terrific. i wou;d recommend you consider this type of phone for overseas .   i ordered a galaxy s3 i9300 and got a refurbished i747 without manuals or the original box, i bought it from asavinings by the way .   i cant make upgrades and i have a problem with the delete key on the screen. i'm trying to get my money back. excelente. my dad bought this for himself and he loves it lovrs it loves it. he cannot get enough of his gs3. samsung is just amazing and amazon has a great shopping and shipping experience will definitely be shopping here again. the phone suddenly die after 6 months it turn itself off and never came back on, good thing the warranty work. this is a perfect phone for those that want an unlocked samsung s3. here in venezuela i had no problems with the settings or anything about this excellent phone. highly reccomended .   wach out! i bought the international version, but i was sent the sgh-747 model from at&t. i had to unlock it by my own to be supported in my country. i was lucky with the tutorials on youtube. 3 star rating. update1: the at & t model sent turned out to be better than the international version, has more resources to use in apps. in comparative sg-i9300 vs sgh-747. now i have a better phone than i expected. that he went up to 4 stars but by sheer luck of fate. update2: after rooted with cyanogenmod jelly bean 4.3.1 was able to run high end games like gta3, gta vc, gta sa, dungeon hunter 4, modern combat 4 zero hour, need for speed most wanted, street fighter iv, anomaly 2 with no problem about insufficient resources .   i got my phone for christmas which wss good but i got 1747 and i order a 19300 but the phone works good .   the phone was not unlocked not work with any telephone operator. it was unlocked from the factory as indicated. deception. i liked it as it is. i wish it had double sim slots, though. very fast and slim. excellent product .   the phone is used! it was not a new phone! unacceptable! this is not a new phone at all! that is what i was expecting! it looks very old and damaged .   the phone came in chinese. and the charging port was not working. when the phone came it was as if the phone was already turned on and used. the plastic was not there and neither were the instructions. it seemed as if the phone was chinese made because all of the samsung galaxy s3 cases that i had it wouldn't fit them .   the downside in this phone, is that i bought the international version, but all instructions are in french. really .   i had to go online to be able to obtain the english instruction's manual. taking that aside, i am happy with my phone .   the phone was described/sold as unlocked/international. the phone that was shipped is not unlocked/international. i am trying to work with sim provided by the local israeli network provider and the phone is asking for a sim network unlock pin. i contacted worldwide distributors - amazon marketplace and supplied them with the phone's imei code. and requested a pin code.they have not yet provided me with the pin. i expect amazon to get involved to expedite/solve the problem - or refund my money .   have problems, one would fault the screen and turns off when the other llamas, no sale as announces new equipment are refurbished. no vende equipos nuevos como anuncia, son refurbished. son equipos remanofacturados aparte estan daã±ados. when the phone first came it looked as if it had been opened and new stickers had been applied but i need a new phone so i threw caution to the wind and opened it it worked fien at first but the battery life is terrible on this phone i assume they used cheap replacement batterys awful battery life only 4 hours after full charge with normal use. awful phone very disapointed. i'm having the hardest time trying to find a sim card that will actually work in the samsung galaxy s3 i9300. i'm in a rural area, which increases the search .   i received like many others the sgh - i747 and not the sgh - i9300. the difference being is mine is the phone you receive from at&t and not the international version which doesn't have all the bloatware and updates only from at&t. i believe most people must not know the difference and so therefor don't say anything. i will be contacting the seller and will update with their answer about exchanging for the right model. buyer beware .   product worked as expected.great phone, screen look great, its size it ok. in general matters the phone works very well. i bought this product for a friend abroad and he was totally impressed. it responded to all the tests of the genuine thing.apparently cheap samsung" clones" do not have widgets. this baby came through with flying colors at half the price. on behalf of my friend- this phone & seller are the real deal .   the samsung galaxy siii/s3 gt-i9300 is the same as all other s3 in term of design style size and all, but there must be something wrong with this particular one. it echos whenever you are on a call and the person on the other end cannot hear you properly. everyone is saying the audio is very low on the receiving end which makes it difficult to hold normal conversation. i have the s4 active as my personal phone and my wife has a s3 for one year now and neither of us is experiencing any difficulty either way. i bought this unlocked international s3 version for a friend, it is beautiful but i am disappointed. i need to know how i can return it for an exchange or reimbursement. i will not recommend anyone to buy this type of phone from this vendor again. please advise me .   i was led to believe i would be getting the s3-i9300 as advertised. instead, i got the s3-i747. i distinctly recall asking the question to ensure that it was the i9300 and i was told yes. the box did say i9300 but the actual product was an at&t i747. i purchased these phones and the batteries are defective. i purchased 4 different batteries using the specification of the phone and they dont fit so now i have phones that wont keep charge and cant find a battery that fit. these phones are costing me more than what i originally pay for them. amazon is refunding the cost to buy the batteries but i live out side of the stated so i have been wasting money to clear items that dont work. i am beyond disappointed and i just give up i will just take it as a lost and learn from my mistakes. dont buy from this supplier and even if them fulfill by amazon. i ordered an unlocked cellphone and the cellphone i got is locked. i am from panama and the cell doesn't work here. now i have to pay almost 50 dollars to unlocked it. why did you send me the wrong item? cesar. please do not consider buying this phone or buying from this seller. i purchased this phone and was told that it comes with an international warranty .but it all turned out to be a lie. the phone worked well for 4 months and then it went all bad .  it became unusable. then i realised that the international warranty thing was a big fat lie just to sell. and when i informed the seller about it .   he was really least bothered. he hardly replied to my mails properly. and hence i am stuck with this unusable phone for over 3 months since i am not living in usa .   so think twice before buying this phone or buying from this seller. i noticed my samsung s3 unable to connect to samsung kies, i went to setting>about phone. i noticed none of the neither android version, kernel verison, nor build number matched the actual phone. android version showed 4.1.2 (actual android os running on my phone is gingerbread and actual gingerbread version only go up to 2.x.x, 4.1.0 or higher is jelly bean. when i tap on the android version a few times it will showed picture of ice cream sandwich android), kernal version showed 3.0.13 user1@ubuntu#100 thu oct 25 12:12:12 cst 2012 (the part user1@ubuntu#100 is a dead give away this isn't original kernal version.) build number showed gingerbread.zski3 (build number always start with the first letter of the android name. ex: jelly bean "jro03c.i9300xxdlj4" or ice cream sandwich "imm76d.l710vpali3".) the other obvious things is the android keyboard instead of the samsung keyboard (you can check that by going to setting>language & input. samsung always used their own samsung keyboard on their devices) missing most of samsung apps such as s voice. no magnetic sensor for compass. no gps for navigation. device have around 500mb ram instead of 1gb ram another thing as i mentioned early you won't be able connect your s3 device to samsung kies if the device is not genuine. another quick and easy way to verify if your s3 device is fake or genuine is to download an app "gs-iii identity" from google play store, open that app, if it showed no match next to board, product, and device then it is for sure a fake s3. be careful buying from sellers who do not disclose their shipping location, the seller i bought it from doesn't disclose the shipping location and nothing got ship out until 1 week later and it was shipping from hong kong. do not buy any phones shipping over from hong kong or china, it is almost for sure you'll end up with a counterfeit phone .   i'll try to be as polite as i can and not swear like a pirate, but you guys really screwed me with this pone. the pone is dead! it's got something called sudden death or whatever, but the point is that you sent a pone that was not opperative at all. pie in the sky, the battery was useless! it worked for like a day and a half and then it was dead, too. i have no idea how amazon taints its name with hacks like this who would just con people with no remorse. thank goodness i could sell it for spare parts and could get most of my money back. i seriously warn you to stay away from this supplier because you'll just risk losing your money .   this cell is not released, it is the opposite of what he says. would not recommend. este celular no es liberado, es todo lo contrario que dice. no lo recomiendo .   i really like the phone, but the case came with a little pressure crack around the camera hole. i'm not sure how, but i'm not happy. also, the case's attaching mechanism has a flaw now (only a few weeks of use) and it pops up a bit, allowing for dust and sand and whatnot to enter. need to buy a new case :(. i am very upset with the product you sold me asavings, by 104-2903263-1585025 cheated because i bought the samsung galaxy s model gt-i9300 iii/s3 factory unlocked phone - international version (pebble blue) for $ 372 and what was my surprise to receive my package arrived was the chinese model samsung galaxy s iii i747 (pebble blue) from at & t without headphones to pass the phone to the date i made â€‹â€‹my purchase cost more or less $ 327.49, i am from venezuela and the procedure for devoverlo is very complicated so i recommend you do not buy with these people, consider them scammers. love this product it works fine. will recommend to anyone who wants to purchase one. awesome product. it was just as described .   mobile is an excellent consider it a powerful machine. i love galaxy s3. recommend, i buy it now i try it. this phone is advertised as a new one but all the accessories looks dirty and the headphone have an old-related yellow color. all the transparent sticker (for protection) have dirty in the gum surface. i expect it works with my carrier at least. i don't know if i expend my money in a used or refurbished phone .   i previously owned a torch and from the time i switched to this, there was no turning back. i can open all my school documents, pdf, word, excel etc, i can go through the phone without any sticking. i just love it. i was going to purchase a tablet but i really don't need one now. this screen size is just right. excelent, tks for your services. the thelephone is a experience great fantastic. happy new year and merry merry christmas. 2014. the phone on itself has all the perks and computing power you need, yet it has been freezing and shutting down by itself (at least twice a day), since the very first day i took it out of the box .   i ordered a refurbished phone from ephonics with some fear and trepidation. the reviews for refurbished phones include many that are apparently not as advertised, including purported chinese clones, us branded phones labeled as international, and phones with flaws that the seller will not replace or repair. the phone i received appeared to be new (it was refurbished) with all new accessories, as advertised. it was indeed an international phone, recognized as such by samsung and google when i connected to them on the web. it includes an fm radio, something missing from us branded phones. when i went to the tmobile store to get my sim card cut for the phone, the phone worked right away. i had an s3 for eight months, but it was stolen just before christmas. i was afraid that i might be buying someone else's stolen phone if i bought another one on ebay or craigslist. the condition that the phone i bought was much better than the one that was stolen (i am hard on phones .  ) and i am fairly confident that this phone was refurbished as advertised. while i have only owned my particular phone i am reviewing for a few hours, i can say a few things about the galaxy based on my ownership of one for more than a half year. -the camera is superb. video and panoramas are especially good. i love having it with me when outside at sunset to capture brilliant skies (the colors seem a bit more vibrant than real life, but that saves "photoshopping" -it does consume batteries when you use it as a smart phone. if you have a desktop you can plug it into during the day or wall plug you can plug it into during the day, that solves the problem, as does having an extra battery or two. after market batteries are very inexpensive and work well. you can swap batteries in a couple of minutes. they charge in a couple of hours or less. -voice recognition works well in english and even in mandarin as a second language. i imagine this is true with other languages as well -the size works ok as a reader. i have a couple of bible apps with dozens of versions, as well as the kindle reader. it's convenient to have when i don't have my kindle with me. - i like being able to use google pinyin for chinese input. switching from english to chinese is done with just one click. -there are hundreds of apps for android that you can customize your phone with to meet your needs - the build quality is solid and the phone has held up well. i haven't abused it, but i also haven't pampered it either. i bought a book for the phone, but have only looked at it for about 30 minutes or less. the interface seems fairly intuitive; i have been able to do all i have wanted to do. i wouldn't want the experiences that other reviewers who have panned this phone and/or its suppliers have had. for me, it looks like the samsung galaxy siii phone i bought from ephonics is a winner. good luck! oh, btw, the phone i owned before i bought from a trusted friend who liked to have the latest and greatest phone and sold his unlocked tmobile galaxy siii after only six months when the new htc one came out. i didn't have another trusted phone with an unlocked phone to sell, so i bought mine from an amazon prime reseller .   this is a product designed for everyday use and with a high quality hardware you will be able to run all kinds of apps out there .   nice phone .   looks great. my wife liked it a lot. video quality is good. screen size is great too. bit slippery .   excelente .   i traveled to another country and the phone is locked. how i unlock the phone? the charger is for european connector too .   once i got to work and installed sim card the microphone is not working and i am in indonesia for several more months. it is dream coming true, there is nothing wrong about this phone. it is state of art. i will forever buy only samsung phones .   this product is exactly as advertised. it shipped quickly, arrived brand-new in perfect condition, and was indeed unlocked. a few people got confused that it is an at&t locked phone because it comes with instructions to route your phone to at&t's data (the instructions for the other carriers are on their websites) but i can assure you, it's 100% unlocked. i use it with straight talk in the states and i have had no issues with it at all. it's also cheaper than buying an unlocked galaxy s iii in the states .   excellent product would recommend, very good features, the phone is more than i expected, everything you could ask for in a cell .   this phone delivers good comfort, ease of use, and long battery life. today if i would purchase a new phone, i would go for the nexus brand just because of the price difference .   does not meet the specifications offered is not the international version! scammers version is a t & t i was cheated. i gifted this phone to my mom she liked the features very much .   the apps r good and its more user friendly .   phone came quick and it is in perfect shape! best phone i've ever owned! i am probably a little addicted. great phone - better than iphone 5s. easy to use and very flexible to customize for my personal use. easy transaction and fast delivery .   i needed a phone that has the latest technology, it is easy to handle, great, internet access and having camera .   this ended up not being the international version, which is what was advertised. the box the phone arrived in stated it was, but it was not. the phone in the international box, was actually the north american lte version .   good buy! think i got a great phone, love the apps, love the size just perfect especially at the price i got it at .   this phone is a dream, great, love it, very nice as described, i am very pleased with this beautiful phone .   i received the phone and first of all i notice that the accessories (charger) and the phone seems to be used (not new at all), both have some scratches. as well, the phone is not unlocked, i can't used the internet service (an it was not a problem of my service provider, because i tried it in another phone and worked perfectly). finally, the phone won't let me actualize the software. avoid buying this phone, it's not new or unlocked and it seems to be recycled or something like that. i will return it, but the problem is that i already payed the shipping and have to pay shipping to return it .   ordered this item thinking i could swap my working sim card into it. this is not the case. after some research i have found that this phone will not work in the us even though it is an "international" phone that is "factory unlocked". i am very dissapointed .   everything is perfect. except the most basic function: call and answer the phone. it keeps dropping calls everytime. i saw in the internet several people complaining about the same issue with this model of s3 (i9300). its impossible to use the phone as a phone. i'm returning this to amazon. i bought another one in brazil and, this time, it worked. so, the s3 i9300 is ok, but some of them just doesn't function properly. unfortunately, mine was one of these .   the phone is awsome, it has meet all my expectations! compared to my old htc this is a breath of fresh air .   excelente produrto. the phone is fantastic, and the shipment came on time, but it didn't come with a screen protector (as listed) and most annoying of all, the serial number on the phone was not the serial number that came up when i installed the sim card from my service provider. i had to pay to have a lab technician reset the phone .   this is not a real galaxy samsung s3. do not purchase this. it has many faults and will crack for any reason. like, keeping it in your pocket for too long .   i bought this phone last year on 2012, after using of 16 month, while charging phone, it burnt .   i talked to the samsung and i was told that since it is international version we cannot do anything, i was surprised that what is this behavior that a company can do with it's customer, i talked to the seller but i did not get any help. same thing happened for one of my friend, do not waste your money, be careful .   highly recommend this product fulfilled all my expectations in terms of quality and price is a great product i highly recommend great great great its a great cellphoneâ¡â¡â¡ its terrific many funtions. the galaxys3 is a great phone. but if your using it with straight talk you have to set up your apn settings this can be frustrating as some of the settings have changed with the new sim cards. make sure you don't have any extra spaces in any of the setting or it will not work. and reboot your phone after each settings change .   the product was on time, and it was what i expected. i recommend it a 100%. the size is perfect .   i bought at 12/16/2013 and upc gave me the phone at dec 18,it is good.however! the charger is not working .  my phone can not charger! this is my first time and my last time to buy samsung. my s3 is working very good and i am wondering if i can upgrade it with the s4 features? very good choice and would recommend it for everyone. seeing that the s4 is out and another samsung product can the price for the s3 be decrease .   the phone is worth the price. i like the specs and it is durable. i also like the specs of the camera .   after 8 months of having it, i must say it is the best smart phone i could hope for. the camera quality is it's best feature. for the price, is a great phone, and work in all operators of my country.iam from venezuela and here are 3 mobile operators movilnet, digitel and movistar. i bought this unlocked galaxy s3 international version to use it in colombia. my concern is that i have not been able to upgrade icecream sandwich to jelly bean. i don't know what is going wrong because i download the updates and it ask me to restart the phone and everything goes ok until adroid displays a red triangle error then it says your phone is up to date but when i go and check out it stills in 4.0.4. some one told me that i have to do this procedure while in the usa with the carriers sim card inside, but i'm not sure if that is true because this phone is not related to any usa carrier or at least it does'nt say so when i bought it. i also tried mac kies and pc kies and non of them worked. if someone had the same problem please give me and advice. other than that the phone works great. july 6/14 i need to sell this s3 and now i relaize it comes only with few languages, some hebrew arabic and english when it should give you many many option in the little reaserch i did. as a matter of fact i could not find the answer to add spanish to it because i't is not suppose to happen. all the tuturial videos i watch have so many languages from the languages menu but not this product. think twice if you will need another language latter on .   nice and fast shpping of the item and the phone is so amazing and fast that you can access to the internet without any problems. product is excellent, however i did receive a damage charger(usb) but i guess these are some of the risk when purchasing online. this is my first smartphone and i have to say it: i love it! user-friendly and with a lot of features, this is a awesome phone .   it is all good. use it often. i is a good computer in my pocket. it even makes phone calls. i chose this model after nearly a year of considering options. the android operating system appeals to me because of its open flexibility. i know several others who have a galaxy s iii and this model seems to offer the power and capacity to get done what i need to do. because i travel internationally, having one phone set that can operate on various mobile systems is important to me. so far, i've been pleased, but i know i have much more to explore and learn about the capabilities of this device .   the phone was fine and it worked perfect but it came with root something in the future i could ocacionar warranty issues. because i oder a unlock phone and when i go back to jamaica where i live and put the sim card in the phone it wasn't unlock so i have to pay to get it unlock. i already had a samsung galaxy siii gt-i9300, bought in brazil, which i was quite satisfied with. however, the mini-usb connector, needed for charging it, developed a bad connection and i wasn't able to get it fixed. i carried on using it, using an external battery charger, which meant opening the back and switching the batteries, putting one to charge while using another one. i bought this one on amazon, expecting it to be the same as the one i already had, however i found that there were several software problems, such as non-operational widgets, limited language support (it only came with keyboard support for english and chinese), which did not include brazilian portuguese, and now it quite often makes it difficult to make a simple call. i have the feeling that i bought a quality reject. beware of buying this phone from this dealer .   big screem,good for watching movie,and make picture ,and the price is good too .great at playing game too.i like the screem .   bad experience, does not work smartphones at & t data plan only with wi fi service at & t says 4g lte smartphones does not work, return the device, and i deducted $ 35 i guess for return policies,. an awesome phone that works as described. worked even in jamaica on their local networks. shuts off sometimes when i'm reading though as if the system doesn't register that is in use .   great seller .   the phone was just what i expected. i had trouble w the chip, which is mini and different of what i had, but they were very nice to me and explained me what to do. great phone and it works great. thank you .   dont trust him! this cellphone is supposed to be unlocked international but it's not .   i had to find another place to unlock my phone and it cost me 65 dollars .   couldnt get in touch w them because could not find an email or phone number. dont buy it .   i absolutely loved my cell and you guys are awesome when it comes from your part! unfortunately, although my cell was in a premium leather wallet case , i dropped it today and while the glass didn't crack, the screen underneath the glass bled purple until i could no longer see the screen ! while the cell works i cannot use it. can you help me please  .   i'd be lost without this phone it's like having a phone it's like having a computer in my pocket :d. best phone in the world. i would put it up against anything else on the market including the newest iphone 5s (which i use for work) any day .   it is so good as cellular that i, my son and wife have bought three samsung s4, and my daughter has a samsung s iii. an excellent purchase! i live in the bahamas and the phone works just fine and was in perfect condition. im not the type to leave comments but i thought i should because i know how uneasy it is to shop online. great buy everyone .   this phone is not working properly. it is loosing signal and when i call people they can hear themselves echoing back to them. i would like to return this phone .   please note i rate the phone 5 stars, the one star is for the seller. i purchased the samsung siii for my wife to use after unlocking a "straight talk sii and found the firmware to be proprietary and would not operate on any other sim card. the phone arrived after being shuffled around thru two different carriers, first via ups (i think) then via fedex to the uk where it will do duty as a primary phone at a us military location. the box was reported as having minor damage but not broken open when it was switched (by the mail department) to the fedex box. (note the original packaging remained intact) . the phone is currently working well but when it was removed form the fedex box and then from the original ups box it was noted that the original factory seal was broken and inventory labels placed over the broken seal, making it appear to the novice that the box still had unbroken factory seals. once inside found the items not well packed (i.e. they where rummaged through) and the headset was replaced by a non factory fake. it is very noticeable since the fake has samsnug stamped on it instead of samsung. this had to be done by the original shipper/seller. so i highly recommend you do not purchase from mobile brothers distribution .   usually the phone get freeze after a while, but this phone started after only 3 hours the touch screen was not working  .  , i restarted and still got the same problem  .   after a week of using it, every time i turn it on it freezes after 5 sec. i tried to reset but didnt work. my phone is broken. it didnt fell and i cannot use it .   what should i do .   garbage phone .   what should i do .   i had a gs3 before but i broke it. oops! so i came online to get a replacement, and i got exactly what i had ordered. i ordered 12/2 and it was delivered 12/6. it's a brand new samsung galaxy s iii unlocked international version, exactly as advertised. it also came with a wonderful wall charger and ear buds. i have absolutely no complaints. i love the phone and i am very happy with the service i received, i see some reviews saying they didn't receive what they had ordered. i'm glad i didn't let that sway my decision to get it bc my order was perfect .   i bought samsung galaxy end of 2012 from you, amazon, on september 22, 2012.unfortunatelly my phone is closed suddenly by itself last week and i can not open it.i bring it to he service and they claim they will try to fix and there is a risk that may phone can break down and will not open again.i bought the phone from amazon but samsung service claims it is not under guarantie.i am very upset and unhappy because of buying samsung from amazon .   i am writing this review 8 months after purchasing the phone. positives - it is still fast, does not crash even if memory is almost full and i still like it. reading articles on this phone is way better than doing it on an iphone because of its longer screen and the picture quality while playing movies on netflix is okay. now the negatives - make sure to protect the phone's screen. it is prone to scratch very quickly. battery life sucks. i have to charge it almost every day especially when 3g is on. it could be a better product if the battery lasts longer .   gave to my daughter for christmas. this international phone can be used in the usa with no problems. since this was an unlocked phone i was able to sign up with any carrier i wanted. took it to metropcs, and they changed the language to english and set it up completely and transferred her old number from t-mobile and all her information to this new phone. she has used it for two weeks now and loves it. it does not come with the english manual but i got her the great book that is available through amazon called my samsung galaxy s111 paperback by steven schwartz, for $18.76. this book is amazing, has over 550 pages, large book size, great pictures. so don't be afraid to get the international phone, it comes with all the special plugs etc .   not unlocked phone when in brazil it did not work although i went to a official samsung place. they had to change the imei and i paid more r$ 190,00 (around us 85,00). i am very sad because i received a china s3 samsung galaxy cell phone with a camera that doesnt work. i paid almost 400 hundred dollars for a cell phone that is not the original one, don't buy to small sellers .  they stole your money. super fast shipping and the phone is in tact and all as expected :) love it .   (can't tell if it is actually international or not, but that is not important for me). i bought mine from a seller called "top10cell". received a real galaxy s3 gt-i9300. appears to be new. the seal looks a little fishy, like it was broken but someone sticked another seal on the broken one. but the phone is totally fine. but everything that came, came in french, including the phone's default language, so i had to change it, no big deal though, since you can find the user manual on samsung website. the phone, as most phones do, came with a bunch of rubbish apps that can't be deleted (unless you root it). everything seems fine to me, except for some reason i can't update my android. tried kies and ota, both failed. might consider rooting it. overall a worthy buy. i owned an exhibit ii but its battery started swelling and the phone is getting too annoyingly slow, so i bought this s3 with $400. the screen resolution is so much higher, and i love the big screen. btw the phone is very light, even lighter than then smaller exhibit ii. for those who complained about its "cheap plastic cover", i don't think that is cheap plastic, i think the material is chosen for its low weight. but a case, that will solves the problem. it came with a samsung earphones, which is not bad (worth more than $10). charger's plug is not american style, but you can always charge it with a computer. yeah! hope it will stay with me for at least three years .   this phone is amazing, it can do a lot of things, the battery doesn't run out fast, there are lots of apps and it even lets me change the language to portuguese. it's a huge advance compared to a blackberry or even iphone. it's easy to use and there are lots of utilities: compass, flashlight, alarm clock, calculator, gps, maps, email, radio, mp3 and video player, etc .   good product,it is a good product complies with all the features expected and cost-benefit ratio. i recommend it to people who want to buy. before i review the phone, i would like to address the bait and switch that seems to be going on. i purchased this phone from a vendor that was fulfilled by amazon, thinking i should be able to trust that vendor. not so. mobile brothers advertised it as an unlocked international with a quad core processor. the protective sticker on the screen even said quad core. however, it was the at&t dual core version. as always, amazon was great. knowing i need a phone, they issued a refund and gave me 30 days to send the crap i bought back. i then did some research, and found a vendor who had an actual telephone number and had a chat with them. their offering was not prime eligible but after speaking to the gentleman, and being assured that what i was getting was advertised, i took a chance. phone arrived in 4 days, and one of those days was thanksgiving. i opened the box, fired it up and it is indeed, the international version with quad core and fm radio feature. neither one of these are available for the us models. only dual core and no radio. if you are considering purchasing this phone, thepowersellers will not rip you off. great vendor! now the phone. i have seen some people claim it's a cheaper version because it's the international version. i have no idea what they're on. i have a friend with a us version and quality is just as good. even better, as the international version has more features than the us version. it boots up in 22 seconds. (i just timed it) has more features than i've even discovered yet. s-voice is a great tool. you can control most of the phone's features, make calls, and send text messages by voice. there is a whole slew of gestures you can enable. the camera is amazing for a phone camera. i can't say a lot more as i haven't had it long enough to explore all the features myself. this is a great phone so far. i don't know what the longevity will be, but then you don't really know that with any electronic device, so only time will tell there. **update 12/4/2013 i have received an email from mobile brothers stating that they did not sell the wrong item intentionally. they seem pretty sincere and due to a couple facts i believe them. the box was factory sealed, as best as i can tell. the protective sticker, as i stated before said quad core. it also states quad core on the back of the box. it would almost seem that the fault lies with samnsung itself. while i know that some vendors are dishonest, i would like to think the majority of them are honest. so i will change the feedback i left for mobile brothers accordingly. and my apologies for any trouble i might have caused them as it would seem they sold the item in good faith .   i've owned a nokia smartphone with symbian os before this, and there is a huge difference between that and the samsung galaxy s3. this is about everything i need and the best feature is the apps that it can support .   i was disapointed with the phone i recieved .it was impossible to download a keyboard in hebrew but it came many other languages i didn't need. i tried to upgrade the version ,it didn't work it crushed during the process. i had to send the phone to a lab to fix it and it cost me an extra 45 usd. arie sommer. i'm owner of one pebble blue s3 i9300, everything was fine, but 2 months and half, touch buttons stop to work, the phone doesn't have warranty, and in one phone service shop i pay 20$ to repair it, and 10 days later buttons again stop to work, this is the problem of mine, but everything another is okay - it's onlock, it's i9300, was in perfect condition - like from store brand new. peoples, you must to know, for this money, do not expect too much, if someone want to be like in store, to have warranty and to be unlock go in store and pay 100 dollars more :). give it three stars cause of delivery was on time and packaging was ok, could of been a smaller box doh. but beware cause the samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version is not unlock. to use any other sim in is totally not possible cause it is region lock to the uk. a note from samsung germany that the note 3 along side some other samsung phones is region locked only until activation. once activated in the european market on a european carrier the lock is removed and users can use the phones without any restrictions but nopes that ainâ€™t the truth peeps. the region lock has appeared on newer versions of samsung galaxy s4 and s4 mini also so i just want you guys to be aware with this factory unlock stupidness with samsung phones. the phone would only ask for sim network unlock pin, note that this is the region lock and not your actual sim card pin, if enter too many wrong numbers you are looking for more trouble with the phone. i give it three stars also cause i had to pay $50us for it to get unlock which was nearly impossible to unlock, after unlocking the phone the phone works great. it is a really cool phone to have. oh and am not from the us am from the caribbean in trinidad .   i have used it for only less than three months, and i protect it very carefully while using it . however, it suddenly got broken yesterday. who can tell me where can i go for warranty .   i'm sure the phone would have worked just fine but i was looking for a phone that works on verizon networks. the information specified that it was a gsm phone but one needs to know what this means - of course i did not. the company promptly provided me with a refund after deducting a $25.00 restocking fee. no issues with the company but the information could have been more clear about which networks the phone will work on .   i am upset with this phone because i didn't even get a chance to use it. do not purchase this phone, i repeat do not purchase this phone. the description clearly states unlocked international version. that is the main reason why i purchased it. when i received the phone and put in the sim card, the phone was locked. i am mad as hell because i was very excited about the s3, but was shocked and disappointed when i could not get it to work. i tried contact the seller and all i was told was to return it, what a joke. i feel very decieved. it hangs a lot poor quality, although international warranty helps. over all battery life is good aneroid upgrade is also a pain. fast and easy just what is expected every thing was great will keep shopping and will have my friends and family do the same. used product it shows as used and not in good conditions missing parts such as simple wall charger did not appear as in the advertise picture. you can't go wrong with this phone! it does what ever you need it to do plus a whole lot more! love it .   very nice phone, it comes with a european charger that has an adapter plub (one plug slips over the other) for north america. other than the inconvinience of a slightly bulky charger, it's a great phone at a great price. beautiful screen and feels very solid and well made. samsung has created another top of the line androind phone .   great phone! bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. i bought it from "top10cell", everything came in a new sealed box as the description says it. only thing made me worry was the "sudden death" issue with the i9300, but i still got it. the one i bought wasn't the one with it, so i'm happy. make sure you read up on the "sudden death syndrome" (sds) and updating to firmware 4.1.2+ (mg4), since i made a wrong choice updating to 4.1.2 where my ieme/sn was removed and cant make calls or data for a few days. cost me another $30 to fix it at a local phone shop. one advise, do your homework before buying anything without warranty .   my husband wanted a small cell work and practice so that you buy and qye mimi is practical and important for me is that my husband and i feel good buy. phone calls a cogigo to connect internet can not connect code requires no. send to my mail code without changing the classification of a 5 1star. this was the worst phone ever for the price. the picture quality was horable. i will be returning. dont waste your money .   this is international which means it is a cheaper and inferior samsung 3 which is being marketed overseas where there is no 4g lte . buyer be aware do not buy this you will be surprised and $380 poorer. 3 mounths after buying it just start the problems  .   i just went dead and then start working again and keep acting like this (i almost go crazy)  .  i sent to assitance and first they say it was virus, then it was the power cable, then was the battery problem  .   always the phone come ok from the assitence and then after a couple of days it just stop working. can samsung do not for me ? (i want a replacemento phone because is not my fault). anyway the phone is not working right now and i lost my patient and i am buying the nexus 4 and try it .   the phone is damaged, have problems with the software, does not work, can not be used since it performs the functions of the phone, the phone is hung, suspended, frozen screen .   best phone i had so far. great screen, light, so easy to use, really frendly phone. really recomend it to everyone. exeeded my expectations .   i only had my phone for 6 months and my button dont work and you guy can't be contacted and help me fix the problem and i'm being give the run around and in the being the phone had little glitches in it and i inorged it but now its worst and i need to fix it on my own an i can't even get the manufacturer warranty and i'm screwd and the phone is not even from here so the stores is telling me they can help me you people are no good and new you were selling defective phones. i buy a gsm phone unlocked and sent me one cdma. i can not use it in my country. and yet i had no response for the solution of the problem. i will continue waiting before the respective legal procedures. i would not recommend you buy from this store. due to their failure in their operations .   this phone is all that the reviews say it is. for this particular version i haven't figured out how to enable voice commands. the microphone doesn't readily appear like some of the other samsung phone i have had. i am sure it's just a download or a setting. buy the phone  .   the screen is freeze ï¼œ power cant turn on ï¼œhappen like this everydayï¼œbad phoneï¼œiphoneï¼ better then this garbage ï¼ ï¼. {edit 8/20/14:} its time to face facts now, samsung doesn't really care about the gt-i9300 anymore, after all, they cancelled the software update. i love android, but dislike touchwiz (samsung's version of android). for any of you out there who is deciding to buy this, ditch touchwiz and install a custom rom, its more stable and uses less ram/you can use more apps on your device. i still use this device, almost 1 year has passed. {bought item in october 2013} after 1 month use it constantly restarts in french instead of english like i set it up it should. i don't know why .   hey, at least it shutdowns and powers up in english and at least its still functions as the description said it would its a real phone which is good, i can update, i had updated to 4.1.2 but recently 4.3 came out and i don't want to update because it was reported the 4.3 os decreases battery life for the s3. so this shows that this product is update-able which is good. this was my first purchase in amazon, i am looking forward into doing business with this seller (shopebest) again. {edit 12/26/13} okay, i had resolved this issue by resetting and also flashing a custom rom to this phone, this phone is the best for any sort of modifications needed for show and to make your friends or co workers jealous about your galaxy s3. with the note 3 + gear came out, you can download 3rd party apps to have the note 3 and s4 like features on your s3, and as for the gear, i have conformed that the latest os of the galaxy s3 is compatible with the galaxy gear if anyone is interested (android 4.3 jellybean). i had flashed my rom with android 4.4 kitkat to make everyone envy about my android. with all that said, i use my galaxy s3 everyday and i would like to say that with this phone you won't have to buy any other sort of entertainment system for about 2 years. here is the link to the seller: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main?ie=utf8&asin=&isamazonfulfilled=0&iscba=&marketplaceid=atvpdkikx0der&orderid=105-8599032-7389053&seller=a20go3csqdoki7. because it was not announced that i had to pay 75 euros custom taxes. such high costs must be announced in advance .   nice phone, works with t-mobile very well. battery life much better than galaxy 2. only gripe is it freezes occasionally. otherwise great phone .   i purchased this phone and within 7 months it stopped working completely it was charging and after that it just blanked off and never came back on mind you it never fell or got wet, i took it to fix and the technicians said it cannot be fixed because its a software problem with this specific phone very disappointed with. this purchase .   sometimes is hard to connect internet by wi-fi and sometimes impossible. battery turn-off saving, mostly, help me with this problem in united states. i hope this does not happens when i come back to brazil .   it seems an excellent phone. it has very good applications, it is very light and very fast connected with the internet. the supplier fulfilled with the delivery time .   samsung sucks. its not the phone you think it is. dont buy it, buy apple. did not like the phone. i tried to activate the phone but i can't cause it is registered with another phone line and it is not new, it is used. i want to change this phone. it's brand new as described, loves it, works perfectly and it is absolutely a very nice looking phone, it's functional and it has a very high quality screen. absolutely recomend this phone is a fine piece of art .   excelente. excelente. good and no problem and the product is at goog sheip works well and i hope to bue very good staff from your sid3e as per normal. i switched from iphone to this phone, and i love it! it has way more features than even the new iphones and the bigger screen is also very nice. it was easy to set up with a t-mobile sim that i bought at wal-mart. this phone was so much cheaper than anywhere else (best buy, radio shack ect .  ) i was originally reluctant to buy it because i thought it would be a fake. but this phone most definitely not a fake. but this phone does not support 4g lte like the i9305's they sell at stores, but i don't even have lte in my area so for 200 dollars less it wasn't a big trade off. it's an awesome phone for a great price and i would definitely recommend it to a friend .   the phone started lagging about a year after purchase. there are just better and cheaper phones out there. the newer s4 is already an improvement, but i would start looking towards the lg ones - g2 or nexus 5 .   its just att version not the quad core not even warranty available for this crab. returned it once i found out it not what the title said gt-i1900 !@#$. i love this phone enjoying it to the max after i got my sim to micro size i am busy using it now love it love it. this was a gift for my wife and now she is very happy with the mobile phone because it has better performance her old mobile phone .   i loved my phone, unfortuntately it stopped working one day, i have read in many sites and reviews that some of this phones got some damaged chips that would cause this sudden death. samsung was reliable enough to fulfill the guarantee, as amazon was as well, so i would feel safe in buying another one. it was a greaat desl. wud buy one more but it took long to come .  but that was ok thou its nice to have a galaxy now. we got this phone from fgs trading for $389. the same phone was $480+ taxes in the t-mobilestore. i thought i would get a lemon but this is the real phone. in this is international version there is a quad core processor from nvidia with 1gb ram. the us version in store has a dual core processor with 2gb ram. i found no appreciable difference in speed. certainly worth the price saving. samsung has nailed it with the s3. the s4 is a better phone technically but it is a little to big. the s3 is just the right size. you can do email, maps, facebook, twitter and browsing (which is what i use it for 90% of the time). the multi window option is good. i can have a review going in the upper pane and directions in the lower one. i would buy from this vendor again. i don't know how they can sell it so cheap but i just got mine. what can i say .   i love everything about this phone. if ur looking to buy one please don't wait, just get and u will be glad u did .   i love it i've bought for friends also. quite good so far. i've also made recommendations and i've had several requests .   was listed as very good condition. i was disappointed when i received my phone. it works good, but had a lot of dents and scratches, and the screen has a small burn in the center of it. this is not the definition of very good condition .   the phone acts as expected .   no surprises. so i'm happy with my purchase, but wasn't surprised with the phone's limitations and the cellular climate where it's used .   excellent smartphone. easy to use. this was a birthday present for my 14 years old daughter and she loved it. it worths every dollar .   works perfect with my metro pcs account. the phone works as advertised, it is unlocked but not jailbroken, no problems at all .   works perfect with my metro pcs account. the phone works as advertised, it is unlocked but not jailbroken, no problems at all .   this was a perfect gift for a dear friend of mine, it was an awesome present and they loved it thanks to you, it came in one piece :-). not a good phone compare to what i had before. i had siii and this phone looks like a fake, poor quality phone. i was in canada when it was delivered to my address. if i was there i would've send it back right away .   good product, nice price , works great & arrived on time. thanks, just the plugin is for europe but the sent me the adapter for it .   the phone was ok but, i did not meet completely my expectations because its case had been opened already. i really thought it was a brand new one .   is the best cellular phone have never owner, is easy, friendly, more functions, the only problem is the battery need more live time. its ok, it did not have a micro-sim card so unable to make calls. disappointed with my purchased. too bad love samsung galaxies. arrived on time, met the expectations/as advertised. very satisfied and happy with the purchase of this product! i totally encourage shoppers to go for it .   ordered the phone for my daughter and she loves it. the price was great and am using it internationally and works perfect .   i just got the phone and it doesn't charge at all it did at first and now nothing . and the product was stated new but the box was not celephan wrapped. and looks kind of old looking. the phone it self looks great but if i can't charge it. it does me no good. hello i just received this phone and im loving it to max. its every thing that it stated it would. i would buy this item again .   excelent phone .   highly recomended especially if it will be used in venezuela. works great .   really happy to have made the change .   i like this phone and the seller is trustworthy, new piece, no problem, i would recommend to anyone, happy ending, but this is 3g not 4g, make sure there are different speed limit, just for informations .   although i am first time user of the android phone , i research a lot before buying this set , i think i am right with the reveiws guided me well . the phone is working very well. it is very user friendly and guide me all the time to the proper way. but the only problem is the battery that burn out within one day . otherwise the phone is alright .   s3 great phone, bought it used. got phone went to activate it, could not still activated, somewhere! i all i wanted was working phone i could use, seller did give full refund but i am still without working cell phone, guess my fault trying to save money .   excelente .   it met my expectation and i can recommend it to others. i wish it was cheaper though - the price i paid is equal to buying the phone from at&t .   i bought this unlocked international phone and it was dead within seven months. this phone does not come with warranty and even the samsung themselves could not repair it as it was an international version. the phone got switched off and it never turned back on. comprã© esta basura y samsung no me da garantã­a en nunguna parte del mundo. el telefono sufriã³ el ramdom reboot sindrome. no vuelvo a comprar nada de samsung, pã©simo soporte tã©cnico y no warranty .   i've never used samsung mobile phone, this is my first samsung mobile phone. its body is very thin, very light, suitable for my hand. appearance beautiful line. i want to say is that the touch.big screen, i like to use it to read a book,fingers, however, often can touch the two return key and function keys below, so that has to look at. after 4 months, this phone decided to stop working. i called samsung.com and they said they don't cover the warranty for international phone, so i later contacted the seller, worldwide distributors. they told me to contact samsung.uk, even though i live in the u.s., but samsung.uk refused to repair my phone since i live in u.s. they only offer assistance to people living in one of the eu countries. in other words, this product didn't have any warranty, and now amazon cannot do anything to force the seller to offer me any kind of support. i spent countless hours trying to get my phone fixed, but i made the huge mistake to spend a lot of money on a defective phone without any type of warranty coverage. wolrdwide distributors is a a fraud and their team is very rude. do not buy this phone from them or any expensive electronic .   good product! fast process four core! battery long duration, according to specification to manufacturer, i recommend this product. good price .   first, you sell this phone as a samsung galaxy s iii (gt-i9300) .   but that's not what i got. i received a package with a double precint, i mean two samsung stickers. when i opended th phone and started to check it out, the battery cover has a scratch a the protective plastic cover was removed and re attached. ok .   let me check if the phone works .   when it started up, and i started to check the apps, i saw a supersu and a chinese app among others apps. why this phone is rooted and have a chinese app? also, it couldn't update via ota. just to be sure, i rebooted on download mode the phone, and wow! a surprise, the phone model is a sgh-i747 (at&t exclusive sgsiii). this is just a joke as a seller, i bought two of this phones, and they both have the same characteristics. you should never buy a phone from on the go. i buyed the phone but u will send me a samsung galaxy s3 mini-not what i want and u take more money of my card like if i was purchase siii/s3 gt-i9300. phone was delivered promptly and was as factory unlocked as described. worked perfectly on my 3g and 4g network. would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a similiar unlocked device .   i heard nothing bad about samsung before, thats why i ordered one. and what should i say, definitly nothing bad .   the phone kool, i am dissapointed that the s3 that i got didnot have a fm radio, and the os is not updating. well it's a really good phone work great is faster and the best of this is the screen is really great and clear cut .   i've received the item yesterday and was really disappointed. the manufacture seal was broken and i can't accept it. it's a rule. i ordered the brand new one, so it must be sealed. i am returning the phone, unfortunately .   great phone, great camera! great wifi connection to internet no matter where you are. love the big screen. never will buy another phone .   i bought the unlocked intl version and i had no problems whatsoever .   great phone. works perfectly in venezuela. loved it from the first second i got it. highly recommend it. the only down point is that the battery doesn't last much. the samsung galaxy s iii is the ideal smartphone. it's stylish, durable, fast and tech savvy. the international unlocked phone is great .  it works perfectly with my local (bmobile) sim card. i recommend the supplier, fgs trading inc. for supplying quality products with prompt delivery .   i did not really consider the consequence of having ordered an international version of the phone. this made me a little nervous once it had been shipped. so far, there is no problem at all. for others.considering this type of phone be aware that you will need an international sim card. the sim is smaller than the us version. i was able to order a new sim from att at no charge (surprisingly). i do not have it yet. the phone is supposed to be factory unlocked and i am going to assume that it is. i will not be able to verify it until i get the sim. the phone (being an international version) uses french rather than english as the default language but i was able to navigate.it with little problem. i like the phone very much so far. the keyboard is easy to use, the back cover snaps off and on easily. i like the weight and the way it feels .   great phone, it worjed very well snd happy to have it so happy. i am glad that i bought it. great smart phone. cost / performanc is unbeatable. if you prefer android this phone is one ofvthe best. cheers, ron k. compared with iphone, there are some bugs, i think. i often have to look the resolution on web. foer examplem calender sync .   i totally recommended this ã­tem, it works for any phone company in venezuela, it's fast and sãºper comfortable, its camera is really cool. i would recommend this product to any one, read quick start manual at this time i do not have required micro sim card to check phone operations and use,the shipment was longer than stated shipment date item was lost in shipment after speaking to company another phone was sent while investigation is made as to what came of the phone. i love the phone but was not verizon comparable. i wasted a lot of my time trying to conect and dint work. there was not enough information all fine prints. it sucks .   i got this phone is late july and the phone has been amazing. i love every aspect of it, it's very fast the ui is very user friendly and i enjoyed using it .  except for the awful battery. phone takes sometimes 10 hours to charge and has not lasted for 9 hours since i've used it. sometimes the battery won't charge when i plug it and and i have to remove the battery. i have been contacting the seller open group wireless for weeks trying to get a new phone and they have done nothing but give me the run around. when they answer my emails it's always asking me what's wrong like i haven't told them a million times and asking for my order id number that i have also sent a million times. i am so frustrated with this company and this phone's battery. all i'm asking is for a device that works the way it's supposed to. i am giving this a bad rating not because the phone sucks, but because the seller does .   phone is awesome .   perfect considering i didn't pay a huge amount for it .   i would certainly recommend this phone for everyone. as far as now the product it's working as planned. fully recomended. i hope keep's working perfectly well. cheers friends. i'm so happy with my samsung glaxy s3, it's in excelents conditions, that's new. i recommend this store. i'm so happy .   i bought the phone a few days ago, it was not an international version, and it didn't work in my country, it said it was for europe only .   this phone was advertised as a gsm unlocked phone. but it didn't work on my carrier. after asking the seller to exchange the phone for one that would, i was told i would have to pay a restocking fee between 20-50%. which, in my opinion, was outrageous. so now i am stuck with a brand new phone that cost me $400 + that i have no use for and cannot sell to my friends or family, because they have the same carrier as myself. needless to say i will not be buying a phone from this seller again. i felt that the lack of empathy towards my situation and overall disregard for the customer was enough for me to look elsewhere when online shopping .   bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. she is having a great time learning all the features and thinks the camera is the best one she has had so far .   it is a really good smartphone. i took me a while to get use to the new os. the only bad about it is that the battery does long much. it has a big screen, that is why .   i am very disappointed because the phone is locked for my country and i have to pay a lot of money to unlock it .   these people sell cell clones koreans are not original care these people are con artist, reading the comments is scam when trying to update them will say that is an aftermarket phone. the exterior of the phone was in perfect conditions, just like new but i had to change the battery 'cause it didn't work .   it talks, surf and also take excellent pictures. personally, i like the photos more than the ones that i take with my iphone 4, 5. i recommend this product, and my only concern is about the os. android, ok it good enough and have a lot of nice tools. the things that you can do with the keyboard are great. however, do you know, the ios is just press the button, which is much more simple .   it is a perfect phone meets all expectations, the tools of visualization, communication, games, social networking, the operating system is very fast, the quality and speed of the camera is great. i highly recommend it .   desde que lo comence a utilizar presentã³ fallas para cargar la bateria y luego de 3 semanas de uso se daã±o por completo. el telefono encendia, pero solo decia samsung galaxy y se repetia. nunca entraba al sistema operativo. lo llevã© al centro de servicio tecnico de samsung y me dijeron que el telefono era una copia de samsung, que la placa base o tarjeta logica, era de otro telefono (otra marca diferente). no compren este telefono aquã­ .   perdida de dinero. since i started to use faults introduced to charge the battery and after 3 weeks of use, damage completely. the phone going on, but just saying samsung galaxy and was repeated. never started the operating system. i took him to the center of samsung technical service and was told that the phone was a copy of samsung, the motherboard or logic board was from another phone (different brand). do not buy this phone here .   waste of money .   i got an iphone after a cheap android and could not handle the switch. the iphone is attractive and has high-quality hardware and feel, but i really do think the android software is better as long as you mind taking the time to get it set up -- and this will require you to be something of a sleuth to uncover all the apps and user forums that will enable you to get things running just as you want them to. once done however, that's the big draw (to me) of having an android phone -- it will run the way you want it to,. iphones just do as apple tells them and if you want something different, well, tough toenails! a few pros and cons about this phone: -- setup and syncing are not perfect with an iphone either. you'd think that would be true, but it's not. having said that, like i said already, you will have to put a lot of effort into getting an android phone the way you want it. especially if you are technologically challenged like me. i'm at two months and counting .   -- you can get an app that will back up your text messages to "conversation view" in gmail. this is great if you ever have important information in there that you need to look up via computer or if you have to change phones. there is no way to do this from an iphone. -- ease of use, for example the "back" button is hard-wired into the phone so in any app it's in the same place. you can also organize all the icons on your home screens any way you want them (iphone snaps them all back in place on the grid so this cannot be done). -- contacts' pictures show up next to text messages, when calls come in and in my phone address book. (it's the little things, but still!) -- the size of the phone is really quite ridiculous. it's not any heavier than the iphone and although it's skinner, the length and width are so big that a number of accessories can't accommodate it (so far i have had that experience with car stereo hookup devices and non-armband pockets/holders for the gym). this is due in part to my keeping it in a water-resistant ballistic case, but let's face it, at $300+ you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to it so i don't feel like i have any choice. at least you will always be able to find it in a purse, but just be aware that your iphone friends will pick on you for dragging half a laptop computer around! -- by far my biggest problem with this phone has been how freaking difficult it has been to get music transferred from my mac computer/itunes to the phone .   i finally got isync to work, but on some forums they claim that it is a known issue that the galaxies unmount micro sd cards all by themselves and then the data on the cards is lost forever. yes, i can tell you that it took several hours to sync music to my phone and most maddening, when that was finally done everything would disappear if for any reason i had to restart the phone. also, some playlists would not sync so i would end up with about half the music i had originally wanted. then upon trying to actually play them, i would get an error message saying that the file type i was trying to play was not supported, which is interesting because i converted all of the songs to mpeg audio format before i put them on my phone, just to be safe. thank goodness i finally realized that all of these problems are probably stemming from the manufacturer, not by my phone itself, so now i can try to get things resolved through the seller of the $20 sd card instead of the seller of the $300+ phone. -- the phone supposedly has a known issue with some exfat external ed cards unmounting themselves; it is not clear what, if anything, samsung plans to do to fix this. >:( -- the siri equivalent doesn't work too well (runs through google), although i never could get siri herself to do much either so i suppose this should be counted as a tie between the two. -- the battery seems to die a lot quicker, even from a full charge. i apologize for this review being so long and mostly pointing out the benefits and drawbacks only of android vs. ios. however, i have never owned a smart phone before so i wouldn't be able to make a similarly detailed comparison between them. i do know that the galaxy and the htc one are probably the top most popular choices and i'm thinking there must be some pretty good reasons for that! anyway, i am happier with mine than i was and i am glad the card problem didn't originate with the actual phone. wish me luck and try a galaxy yourself -- you might like it too .   i would recommend this product. the only thing is that it doesn't work on 4g just in 3g. however the entire smartphone is really good. the phone i bought is a "samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version (pebble blue)". the phone i received is a samsung galaxy s iii / sgh-i747, installed with a gt-i9300 old firmware version. as a result, the phone had a poor screen resolution and a very poor camera performance and a lot of bugs in applications. when i tried to update the software to the recent android 4.1.2 firmware version the phone died and was very hard to discover why. the phone works fine with its original sgh-i747 firmware and don't understand why they changed to gt-i9300 .   exellent thanks very good cellphone my friend ! i don`t know so much english jeje .   i am sorry, s3 good. thank you this program work for what i needed. i want to thank the agent for helping me save money .   this is the first mobile phone i have ordered through amazon. the phone came a day later ( the shipping company said it will come through express service). none the less, the phone was in excellent condition and its working just fine. the price of it was lesser than found on most sites, so i was a bit concerned about its quality, but i am totally satisfied with the service .   my phone didn't recognise my sim card, so because of that i changed the sim slot, after that i had the same problem. then the guy from my local service realise that my phone doesn't has some code and now i should pay for that 40 euros .   did not receved but my credith card was charged am about to take they next step b calling my lawyer if my money is not back on my account with in they next 3 days this is rediclous. great disappointment  .   buy the samsung galaxy s3 gt-i9300 quad core again and they sent me a different model the galaxy s iii / sgh i747 dual core no box no accessories and no manuals. do not recommend. gran decepcion .   compre el samsung galaxy s3 gt-i9300 quad core nuevo y me enviaron otro modelo diferente el galaxy s iii /sgh i747 dual core sin caja sin accesorios y sin manuales. no recomiendo al vendedor. absolutely the worst, ive ordered alot of stuff from amazon and this is the only product defective! i ordered a new phone and i received a used and refurbished phone. not cool .   the phone comes with root .   it found the first time because defective and with root permission. i'm not covencida with this purchase because in the description of the product it designates that the software is modified .   it's very well it's new phone i like it very much thanks give me a nice phone ! !  .   i bought it myself oline. i like the white color.also,it's very covenient for me because it's an internetal one.thank you .   all i can say is even though it's a quad core phone , android 4.1.2 is awful  .   construction was okay and there were no dents , scratches or marks on the unit . as millions of people have said in the past it's a fingerprint magnet so have some fibrecloth and isopropyl alcohol at all times . battery life is poor .have to charge it every day which is ridiculous ( forget about the myriad of so called battery saving apps in the android marketplace they do not work ). just terminate any processes of any apps you're not using and it might give you at least 24 hours of non stop use . camera , audio /video playback , bluetooth functionality are okay . call quality is okay even though the cellular networks down here are sub-standard . as time goes on i'll update this review . cheers  .   it is good fast response and easily usable. it can be open and closed easily and i can go through any requirement in few seconds .   bought this phone for my husband to use overseas. he loves it and it works great. he now prefers it over the i-phone .   didnt know tht international was a phone you could only use outside of the country. not descriptive, if you have never used international phones before. also very brief when i would e-mail the person on questions .   supplier did refund my money minus shipping which was fair, but the unlocked description was confusing for us, a verizon customer. supplier was courteous and fair. we had a little misunderstanding when unit was returned that it wasn't in original packaged condition (stickers were off, cords weren't wire tied, etc., but we worked through that. if you think you might need to return, i would suggest keeping all contents in original condition so the unit can be resold without supplier having to re-package .   just what i need, a smartphone with that kind of program that is to many friendly. the conection with the world .   wow. there is no warranty on this phone. it died of a (now documented) sudden death after the amazon return period. samsung usa will not service it. calls to england resulted in a message that it would not be serviced since the item was purchased in the us. because this is the international version not sold in the us samsung will not service it here. i will never buy another samsung product since they will not stand behind it. this was a rip off of over $500 and amazon will not help.it wouid be best if amazon refused to sell samsung products. very,very unhappy. feel cheated. there is no warranty at all. the problem i had is also with the vendor, blutekusa. they do not care if the items they sell have no warranty, nor do they trouble themselves to alert potential buyers to this fact; blutekusa did not: (1) advise purchasers in the u.s. that because this was not an item supported by samsung usa that there was no warranty that comes with the product (2) that a third party warranty was available. i wish amazon.com that provides excellent service to its customers, would remove blutekusa from its companies that make products available on the amazon site. unlike blutekusa, amazon does not take blutekusa's "caveat emptor" philosophy but wishes to please customer. blutekusa wrote me: 'just so you know, thousands of customers have purchased this item from us and many of them were able to follow through with their warranty in the country of origin. some have worked with samsung in the czech republic, italy, germany, and numerous other destinations. many other customers, knowing that they were purchasing an international version of the item, purchased third party warranties through square trade, geek squad, and other such companies in the industry to make sure that they were covered in the us. we cannot take responsibility for an item purchased so long ago as we do not get anything to uphold other companies' warranties. if the company decides to void their own warranty, for whatever reason, that is not something that we are able to uphold. a motorola phone that i owned stopped working one day and when it was sent to them, they stated that the phone was water damaged. there was no water damage when the phone left my possession but that was their reason to void the warranty. so, i do understand your frustration and there is a manufacturer that backs us to uphold their warranties but, unfortunately, samsung does not. we are very sorry for any issue this may have caused you but please feel free to contact us if you have any other questions or concerns." would not it have been nice to have been advised that there was no warranty on this product if purchased in the us, but third party warranties were available? nice of the representative to slam motorola without documentation.  .   the next big thing is already here, got this for the girlfriend, she doesn't really like all these gadgets like me, but lives this phone and feels like she is a whole new world after moving from an iphone 4, would not change it for anything else. the phone was in great condition but part of the package was that it would come with the charger but it didnt it came with the old ipod charger instead .   excellent product, the product is as it as it was published, i had no problem with it and it works great, just had to putting on the sim card, fully recommended, no complaints, thank you very much. excellent product. meets all my expectations. great attention by the seller. recommended widely. completely satisfied with the purchase. again recommend. el mejor cel del mundo. por lo menos hasta que tenga el s4 .   muy buena atenciã³n a la hora de la venta. was the best choice that i made .   good product i recommend it and i will buy again to him  .   its one of the better phone that i had its a same product that the samsung 4 but its better price. very good. it's my first android and so far its working perfect, i was a little nervous because i'm in venezuela but it's working just fine .   i bought this as a gift to my wife (b'day). got fed up with at&t contracts. now i'm happy and can move to any carrier. only thing got concern is, when i open it first time saw some asian language settings. other than that everything is good .   i loved this cellphone, it's amazing. it has multiple functions an wonderful apps to download. it's my first time with a samsung cellphone, but i really like it .   nice phone, exactly as new as brand new one. thanks u! but it is international phone, i can not use 4g with my contractor .   it's amazing, its form factor, the big bright screen, the battery life .   but i noticed it gets kinda slow when there are a few apps runnin at the same time, it didn't happen to me with my iphone 4s .   i got the phone after 24 hr, brand new, working fine outside the us , no problems at all. good deal .   i feel totally ripped off, the phone is repaired and sell it at a high price, the phone i received powder gets to the screen, you will damage the load pin is totally an abuse because in any momeno specify that the phone is repaired. this seller should get out of here because it leaves very badly amazon. you do not respond or give guarantees, is a total abuse .   it's one of the best cellphones i've ever had it's bigger, faster, more comfortable and very easy to use i recommend it for those who love technology. buy back have no trademark, is an engineering machine, the screen is very rough, i cheated, i will sue them this joint .   good friend i have tremendous shipping with the purchase i made the samsung galaxy that was supposedly released and new to me is rebuilt and not connected to internet says something at&t why? have software that is not published in the article i could not use the phone because of you that i sold this product q is released and comes with root which ustede downloaded it to free venezuela'm losing money, annoying and without having someone make a formal complaint  .   i bought this cell phone for my grile frend she love it works great for here it is get every thing you need on it .   i received a celular not genuine because i checked it by imei that is a brand nokia model 1661. i will return the mobile phone. i bought this phone but the battery is too large. does fit the phone. later i discovered it is from korea .   it's a great cell phone, great pictures, i recomen to anyone, its easy to use. you can expand the memory. it's only been a month since i have the s3 and it is taking 18 hours to charge. i have written to og wireless but have not received a response. i am very disappointed and upset about this. please give feedback if any thing can be done to rectify this matter .   i really like this purchase. i recommend to more people. the way they had arrived in advertising. thank you for all .   overall i love the phone. very easy to use. only downfall is the crappy battery life, it needs to be charged daily .   absolutely loving it! still getting used to the size because i have small hands. otherwise than that its great! definitely recommended. just the right colour size and has all the features i would want in a smart phone i might want to upgrade to an s4 jus for the additional features .   product had great appearance, worked as expected. since it is 'international' version, it does have a tendency for insist on metric system, i do well with both metric and imperial options .   love it  .   no issues at all thus far, has great memory a great camera and runs smoothly in terms of ram and games. the phone works perfectly in belize and it is easy to activate and understand. i am very comfortable using the phone .   i certainly would recommend this product for the price. not bloatware on it ,sleek fast light. only thing i would say is get a good case , so it doesn't slip. love the big screen and bright colors. phone has more than met my expectations. i would tell everyone to buy this phone. very fast shipper .   very happy with the samsung s3 both in terms of functionality, phone quality, camera qualitym and its large screen, very happy we purchased it at amazon for a fair price. recommended. ok so i received this phone this morning and i expected to get a phone exactly like the one i have .  nope! i guess the international version has a lot less features than the american version. front camera is horrible and the oled screen it claims is not oled. its obviously led. it doesnt even have nfc as it claims. i really feel like i should have only paid 200 bucks for this fake thing. it doesnt even have swype or s-voice. i actually think its rooted because the kernal version says ubuntu .  seriously? i was expected to latest andriod version but instead i got gingerbread! wtf .   the only reason i am keeping this is because im tired of looking for phone but i advise you not to buy this phone from this seller .   excelente producto rapido en envio por liberty express a venezuela y barata y en atencion excelente, lo recomiendo excelente calidad. the battery did not even fit into the phone. i suspect that this is not a genuine samsung galaxy s3. beware .   bought this for my sister loves her phone no complaints on it and it is nice in white but i like the black better which is the one i have. i have been using this phone for about 3 weeks not and i love it! it came exactly as described and on time. the phone has a great camera and a great screen .   i have had no problems with this smartphone after 3 weeks of use, it works really well, met my expectations in terms of battery life camera functionality, size, fit etc. the phone was delivered as was promised . however is was advertised as having 16 gb of built in storage but the product came with only 11 gb and this was very disappointing  .   this seller sold by phoenix smartphone & tablet repair. its the best seller i ebay i love it my new phone galaxy s3. i had bought this phone used from a seller called "sale_ms" although it does work, the phone i received was no more than a chinese clone of the galaxy s3. i discovered this when at first it could not be detected by my computer and only had 2gb of storage space. second, the dead-giveaway was the android version. the phone i received was running android version 4.1.9! this version is not a real licensed android version! make sure you don't buy a fake phone and have to waste your time *trying* to get it returned. if you are buying used, make sure you contact your seller beforehand .   this phone is encoded with european frequency which is different than u.s. frequency used to receive internet signal. therefore, where you can get 4g or 4g lte with t mobile service (for example) using a u.s. phone, you will only be able to get 2g or 3g on this phone due to the frequency coding being different. for the additional $60 for the phone plus $40 of sales tax for $100 total more, it was worth it to me to get the u.s. version of the phone from t mobile instead .   i got my samsung s3 with prime delivery option. it was so fast (next day delivery). on top of that, i'm happy that i have decided to purchase this one. because before the purchase, i spent my time researching on the os, screen size, the brand, and camera quality. samsung s3 won my heart. i love it and i have unlimited option with this unlocked phone. i can use it when i'm abroad and in usa. it's perfect for my lifestyle .   -after 4 months the usb port stop working and the phone is not under warranty by samsung and is really hard to get it fix. some of d features are not working don't know if its a used phone but feel robbed once again by amazon. the phone is not good, they send me a good battery for s3 but the phone is a fake, because it doesn't have the same place for battery like one real, and now they don t answer to me. i am happy that it is working and all, i have already 2 originally from t-mobile, but needed another for my other line when t-mobile was by 2 contract but not anymore but still cheaper. i did get lucky in this one, it works .   just the bad thing about it is that it was not unlocked as it stated .   that is why i took a star off .  and the other, the battery dies really quickly in use, but fixed that, purchased a new one at a real store,t-mobile =) other then that i cannot complain about the phone, works great so far .  just wish it was unlocked, oh well .  i cannot complain. i "kinda" would recommend this simply because you do not get what they say you will .  or worse, get duped and have nothing working .   in the publication was saying that hera a samsung galaxy s gt-i9300 iii/s3 and sent me samsung galaxy s sgh-747i iii/s3 hera not what promised in the publication. would not recommend it. heats up after 1 minute of video or phone call. not as fast as i expected it to be .   i am happy with the phone but it did not come with english instructions and i was not able to obtain any when i called samsung .   i wrote a bad review a few days ago, and i was wrong. the bad phone came from another vendor (it was junk!). this phone works well so far. quite happy with it. my apologies for the mistake .   this is a great phone but they sent me the at&t version of this phone not the international one as they promise in the description .   excellent cell phone just what i needed very comfortable! i get very good condition at the agreed time and this seller is highly recommended purchase is secure! recommend it. the phone is really good. but the screen flashes sometimes , but the price is ok. i like it. i got it on the second day i ordered it. it's cool .   after debating for months, i decided to go for the samsung galaxy iii and i'm not sorry for even one minute. the android os is simple and intuitive, and the phone's features are amazing. the camera's photos come out bright and sharp and the video has excellent sound as well. the minor drawback is that it the screen is a bit large and doesn't easily fit into a pocket .   the smartphone is a proven and excellent performance, just the right size to not be uncomfortable. the only unfortunate thing is that i get my hands to open box without memory 16 gb micro sd. i feel so disappointed and cheated .   this lived up to its expectations .   the features are amazing .   camera is my fave .   very high quality pictures .   wish the battery life was a bit longer .   but i guess its because i am my phone hence everything goes through my phone. the included battery in the sealed box doesn't fit in the phone .   the battery's part number it's correct. so is the phone or battery counterfeit? there is no back cover protector, and the speaker grill on the back appears dented. the seal sticker on the box was over another sticker. are these units refurbished or counterfeit? and the only instructions were in portugues. is this what they mean by an "international version"? i thought i could buy with confidence since this is fulfilled by amazon, but obviously there is no quality control and amazon just stores and ships what ever junk they get sent .   the product presents size, design and functionality very good and the negociation and shipment is accordingly to informed! as a suggestion, this required field should be smaller and more friendly .   it is wonderful, so useful, so nice, you can do everything what you want. internet is so fast, there are a lot of applications. dear all, i bought this cell phone but i got shocked when i opened the box , the battery doesn't fit in phone , then i decided to buy another battery , another big shock is , i did not find any battery at battery shops , the seller said you must request it from amazon , i bought 3 battery for same model gt-19300 , but also doesn't fit , now i have owned this fake phone for 3 weeks , what should i do , can i return it back and i get my money back  .   excellent, on time, product the pone works well, everything ok,im very satisfied with tis purchase, highly recommended for all those who want a high level cell phone. run in many countries, unlocked version is real, it works soft and easy in our country. android system runs ok and it is better than bbz10 and samsung sii. product was according to expectations. it was easy to track and very professional packaging. nothing to complain about. good job. i can,t start the phone it's without software it is not gt-i9300 it is a korean version and now i have 1 week in america and i can't send you back the phone sooo im not happy. 1. the seller says it's original but has no samsung service (i couldn't register it with them). 2. it has 4.1.9 android version (a custom build according to seller) where it should have 4.1.2 3. it doesn't have: compass, magnetic sensor, gyroscope and pressure sensor. 4. it doesn't have a camera flash. ain't it enough? i'll never ever buy anything from this seller .   it just awesome .   it helps me out so much for business and otherwise, wish the battery life would last longer but other that that  .   i just love it .   this is a very good item, will recommend to anyone that i talk to on the internet or face to face. i have 2 major issues with this phone. not able to have data plan for this phone, the at&t guy said that this phone is not compatible with data plans. the other is not able to transfer data from phone to pc. on connecting the phone to pc, on pc we can't see that phone is connected to it. one more issue i noticed is it is not allowing to upgrade the software .   tgu enterprise sold me a fake phone. a clone. the galaxy siii battery did not even fit, and neither did the case .   this piece of hardware is awesome. i choose this on basis on price difference with its successor s4. s4 has slightly more horse power which is not very vital for my use and the difference between the two , saves me about 200 dollars. so far i havent had any issues with this phone .   best bang for your buck, great phone great performance and just updated it to android 4.2.2 now it's even better .   the cellphone is amazing, easy to use, modern, resistant and with a beautiful design. i loved also that is not a heavy phone. the updates and the software in general is very fast to easy to do ti. my feedback also includes the on the go solution customer attention: the delivery time was amazing, and the post sales attention too. i'm not in us, and even in this situation, when i needed assistance to solve a doubt about the version provided of this device, the on the go solution did an exceptional customer attention and showed total accountability to help me. that is the best experience that one customer can have, and the telephone also, i love it .   the galaxy s 3 phone that i received was not working, does not take a charge and the screen was cracked. that is to much money to spend on a defective product like that one .   only i can say  .   is that this phone is simplely wonderful jaja  .   buy it  .   and dont will regrets. i liked it very much, it is just as i expected. i'm satisfied with the product. i will continue to enjoy it .   this is not a gt- i9300, this seller it's taking us for fools! (no es un gt-i9300, este vendedor no estã¡ tomando por idiotas!) don't buy this if you don't want to have issues and problems! i'm an engineer and i assure you all that this is not an original gt-i9300, it's just a sgh-i747. this guy is selling this as a i9300 because he wants to sell more .   it's just false advertising .   no compre esto si no quieres tener problemas! soy ingeniero y puedo asegurarles que no es un gt-i9300 original, es simplemente la versiã³n americana sgh-i747. este tipo estã¡ vendiendo esto como un gt-i9300 para tratar de vender mã¡s - es sã“lo falsa publicidad .  ) .   we are very pleased. the phone works beautifully. great reception, great picture! no problems whatsoever! kudos for samsung! i'll definitely get their products .   i loved the phone! it was just what i was expecting! muito bom! podem confiar que o serviã§o vale a pena .   i don't know what to do. the device has never turned on. nothing happens. i chatted with amazon that recommended to find out a solution with samsung. samsung in brazil did not accept to fix imported devices. i also tried to a generic service center to test it, that gave me a feedback the device is damaged externally in the case. i am sure i unpacked correctly and never damaged it. i bought it when i was in the usa couple weeks ago. help me please. i don't intend to pay more $ 500.00 to fix it complete .   this phone is great perfect in every way possible i have the phone in jamaica and everything works well on my lime network. absolutely no regrets in buying it im in love.lol colour is really nice, just perfect. perfect phone it is international and it is unlocked. after one month, my phone keep on restarting for every 5 mins. i took it to repair shop they told motherboard needs to be replaced. which costs almost half of the phone cost .   i just took a chance even by looking the reviews .   i am screwed. i bought this s3 in may 2013. it was good until last week (august 10) the screen didn't light up any more. brought to the repairing shop and they said this was factory fault that they had seen in some s3s before. i contacted this seller for an answer. after getting a reply saying "you bought this phone from may, what do you want us to do at this point?", i clearly stated my problem, how specific the phone's defect was, and that i wanted to trade another well-working phone. then they never respond to me though i tried to resend the email. trying to contact amazon customer services now .   truth is, phone works well, but it came with a preloaded video, disgusting and degenerate, not even porn, worse, unhuman things, some people may find it funny, i don't know, but i bought a new unused phone and instead, i received a loaded phone, with disgusting videos, and i wonder everyday what would had happened if the phone was a gift for my daughter and she saw that disgusting video of nude people doing disgasting things i should not explain on this review. and i am not speaking about pornography, or sexuality, its a unhumain video .   i switched from an iphone 4 to this samsung galaxy 3. this phone is very disappointing. it is not convenient, had to lean how to use it compared to an apple product. unfortunately it is too late for me to return it. do not buy it .   mobile phone battery charger does not work. the phone was not made in korea or usa. it was made in china. it does not match with the seller's description. s3 is still a wonderful option for a reliable phone with wonderful features. the price was nice and the phone was delivered on time and unblocked as promised .   to insert sim card and memory card battery needs to remove. very low quality body (very sensitive) its having good software features and technology. comparing to all features its expensive .   this s3 is bigger (but don't heavier), faster than s3 i owned. i receive this item one day before that i hoped .   the gps doesn't take effect in china. have to turn on the wifi or enable mobile data. in use, it worked very well .   this product with very good and much more features and a easy keyboard to send a text. i loved this product. this phone works great no issues, good battery life and i truly love that i can connect to any network with this unlocked version. be aware! these are fake samsung phones. the guy told me that it's original but he sent me a fake one. make sure the package has serial number on it .   i am very satisfied with the product, samsung gt-i9300 galaxy s iii/s3 is excellent, the product is very original, the package arrived in good condition .   i am pleased with my phone. what was shown is exactly what was received. i have a serious problem with the carrier's delivery. it was not signed for but left outside. if someone had taken it would i have been reimbursed .   this is good .   i love this phone. and i will readily recommend it to anybody. i think the price too is good .   i love my this marvel! is like having a powerfull machine in your pocket. the best cellphone out there right now (except for the s4), without doubts  .   the product i got is not what the seller publicizes. the ad claims the product is brand new but my phone has been modified. it is impossible to bring it back to the original setting. the android version is 4.1.1 which is old and doesn`t allow updatings. two more identically advertised phones were bought by my brother on the same day from a different seller and the phones coincide with the ad. i feel i've been cheated. amazon offered to change the phone but i still need to solve how to take it back to the states. i'm happy with how amazon is dealing with the situation but awfully disappointed with the seller .   `veryh great awesome perfect cell phone that is at the edge of the technology it's was all as described and went fine. i am not really a cell phone person and prefer to communicate with people face to face. well the phone has the ability for me to achieve this. is is lightweight and easy to use. glad i made the purchase .   it was for the first time that i did not pay enough attention to the reviews for this seller and "was happen also to me". i received a fake product. it did not work ok from the start but did not realize that is a fake samsung. the serial number on the telephone was different from the serial number on the case and i saw this only after a personel from a service point from one of mobile carrier show me. i send back and the story has a happy end - i received back all the money from amazon .   had the phone for 3 month, for some reason stopped charging even after changing the battery. contacted the samsung usa and they would not honor the warranty. i looked at the previous reviews and found 110 previous reviews with the same complaint .   the phone is very slow, there is a problem when we try to call because it doesn't get tone. unhappy .   samsung galaxy s iii phone is the best i ever had. easy to use, efficient, very good price. i recommend. ok, so upfront i must admit i have not had a smart phone before & many people gave me grief & would 'needle' me at work. this phone is absolutely & utterly amazing .   i can hardly believe the conveniences it provides. i took several photos today & the quality of the camera alone is astonishing .   i feel "blessed" to have this .   samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international .   excellent 100 x 100 percent recommended and responsible .  .   very good product, it works very well. it is easy to use and has high function. very good, i like it .   they sent me the "samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone" international version. it was from mexico and was from the service provider "iusacell" google it. anyways the phone was locked and wouldnt even let me update it. i tried unlocking it but they hid it from me pretty good. dont buy from world wide distributors. you wont get what you expect. dont fall for there rouse like i did .   phone work great awesome i um very please technology you got to love it i um very please with this piece of equiptment. i have not received the original smartphone, i have received a copy with the following characteristics: - battery life of 4 to 6 hours (without use of phone features). - the phone turns off by itself suddenly. - no connectivity to my local supplier of telephone services (although the bands are compatible): signal reception is intermittent. - no data connectivity. - the phone has several differences in design when is compared with other originals samsung galaxy iii .   the phone is great. the only thing that bothered me is that it comes rooted. this is a problem because if something happens with the phone the warranty from samsung is not valid. it is also a problem because you cannot make a software update. aside from this detail the phone works great and it is just what i expected .   i have tried many methods, but unfortunately could not connect and sync with outlook. besides, everything is very good. speed / camera / construction / sound / screen .  also good .   the s3 is an amazing phone, even considering is more than a year old. i bought this phone as a replacement for other s3 that got lost. price is going down which is a plus! definitely i would recoomend this phone to people, it's even better than iphone 5 .   excelente .   i had the chance to get the ss4 but i like so much that i decide to not change unless there is something much better than this, for me this is the best phone i ever had. this phone is really good .   only problem is battery life. if you are an app person; make sure you delete the unwanted apps that are loaded in cache once after the use. because otherwise it hangs and doesn't respond so fast .   awesome phone, bought this for a friend of mine and she loved it. no complaines at all! and the colour was nice. excellent phone. the only thing that is not included es the geotaggig geature in the camera. you should point this out .   i was user for another brands and samsung exceeded my expectations by far. the best phone that i have had. highly recommended. although i love the s3 this vendor sells me a phone that it's modified and i've been through hell trying to update the firmware. bottom line the phone it's amazing, great deal, no issues whatsoever (except the update to 4.1.2 but it's not a samsung problem) .   i bought this cellphone couple of months ago. it is pretty user- friendly and convenient , but there is some small problems like having issue to insert a language for using in keyboard ( i have to reinsert the second language 2-3 times a week). all the bad reviews on this phone is correct .   please take heed and do not buy this phone if you do not live in the us .   it is not an "international version" as stated, i bought this phone but i live in the caribbean the applications are not supported here, although the phone states international. i am very disappointed and up-set as this phone is not cheap; i am also disappointed in amazon. now i am stuck with this phone .   very poor purchase .   a very good brand new samsung s3 phone, so cheap, classic, and potable to carry out. i encourage you to go for it .   this phone came 2 days sooner then expected. excellent condition. even the tmobile guy was surprised at how great it was! works perfect so far. didn't have to do anything weird with the language settings. the only downside is that it came with an international wall plug. didn't really affect me because any micro charger will fit into it. i have been completely satisfied with this product .   i would buy again .   i have enough with this phone! it keeps rebooting every single day! i just had for 1 week! the phone keeps rebooting, restarting, and remaining in the starting screen. i got sick of this phone! i really want to return it .   this is very unfortunate for me to write a review like this, but i have to explain for better understanding. i brought this new phone for $472.25 and gave as a birthday gift to my friend in abroad. since its first use, for every 2minutes, it started rebooting. he was so frustrated and ended up paying $150 for repairs. so consider all options before going to buy it through this seller .   bought this phone as a gift for my fiancã©e and she can't put it down. its been approximately two months since the phone has arrived and its been working great so far .   i sent another version was not the version of the ad sent me the version of the t777 and not international version i9300 that was written in the announcement the i9300 and sent me another product  .   very fast phone . comes with all the cables. the battery is okay too have a good duration buy it. was for a grandchildren. birthday present, he is happy.whit hes new toy.hi like it.and i m happy too.thank`s bye bye. i loved this phone, but about seven months after i started using this phone without problems i suddenly stopped having access to internet or internet based apps, i could only work with wi-fi. i contacted my provider, we tried troubleshooting, different configurations, etc, nothing worked. i went to the store, the sim card was changed, it still did not work. since it was unlocked i had to contact the manufacturer. because it is an international version, samsung us said they could not fix or repair. i emailed samsung uk and they said that because i was located outside the eu i should look for a local repair center. i finally went back to amazon and they had the best customer care service and i returned to the seller for a refund. i am still buying my new phone from amazon because of their fabulous customer service .   is there any guruntte ? what should i do? it just happaned suddenely without any thing happaning. very frustrating. only 9 monthes. overll a great experience for this product. this has all the latest futures and the word of free apps with andriod os .   great product, perfect interface, good price, quick navigation, tutorials online, clean appearance. defenitely recommendable for beginning users of smartphones. regards. the phone is the most complete of the sg3, this model is the quadcore and worth paying for, thank you very much for the excellent service .   the samsung galaxy is exactly the device u want to have. it looks elegant and the functionality is exceptional. get it. i dont know what is wrong but the phone keep on shutting down like after every 5 mins. this is my second s3 and this is the first one to give me problem. im not pleased at all. feeled ripped off. i bought this samsung galaxy s3 as a new phone. i initially got a phone that didn't work properly, phones were always dropping as well as i could not navigate through the internet because it lost signal. after the phone was changed to a "new one", i got a used phone, the screen was popping out, the usb port didn't work properly and the battery was not even samsung original. it was obvious the phone was used even though it came sealed inside the box. the worst experience i've had with an amazon supplier. i'm simply happy with it. good size, steady, has never frozen and battery is still good after 7 months of use .   it is a useful smart phone work, at home, or on the street, adapted to all communication needs and versatility. i believe that this is a great phone. good screen, awesome in size and totally customizable. very happy with it. a review in amazon isn't good enough for just buying this. i can recommend gsm arena for a much better review and detailed .   ordered for a friend of mine and she loves it. the screen size is just right. using whatsapp,viber & magicjack besides the camera is something she really loves.samsung galaxy s3 the best mobile phone samsung has ever made besides the new samsung galaxy s4. works great and has very good battery life .   i bought this for my wife and my kid, phone is amazing with international warranty, sound clarity is good and apps compatibility is also great .   it has very bad battery. it takes more than 48 hours to get fully charged. it gets empty in 2 hours .   i got my order on time! my samsung galaxy s3 came in a brand new box with all his accessories but i dont know what kind of charger is that because it cannot be charged in america or jamaica where i go back and forth regular, in-addition the phone is advertised as "version" but i dont see any sign of "version" on the phone therefore when i go to jamaica i hope it is unlocked and i dont have to pay any expense to open the phone for it to make it work .   but all and all the phone seems brand new and i like it thus far so i will see what happens when i reach jamaica. #yup. i bought it for my brother- he loves it .   very comfortable and easy to use for a phone. almost better than the iphone .   :). i buy this phone for my cousin, its functionality is very good and it really is very fast, the graphics are outstanding, i think i'd buy one for my soon. it is a little big but easy to handle. the phone samsung s3 i arrive in excellent condition and new exactly as displayed, recommend hasslefreecell as an excellent seller. very good choice  .   i am excited about my phone, until now i have done very well. excelent equipment. i liked it so much .   the phone must have been an early model as it has only android 4.0 which i cannot seem to find a way to upgrade it because samsung kies only works with usa models and samsung does not support the international versions because the american tely companies have a very strong hold of all the phone manufactures. the volume is an issue .  when a call come in .i almost miss it because of low volume.also ,the glass cover over the camera lens at the back is missing .   i think the phone is a good phone but the seller on amazon give me a bad deal with the phone because it is not holding the charge for any long period of time .   i see that you are an irresponsible and these scamming buyers really you stole my money, i timaste but i forgive you so god knows. successes. the phone performs just as well as a brand new one. the battery is even fine. this is an amazingly smart phone,. please, before you buy this phone be aware that when (not if) it fails, you are left with a $455 paper weight. there is a very, very common charging port issue with this phone. do a search on the web, the online forums are bursting with people with the same problem. i had it for exactly 57 days, not even a scratch or a ding on it. i loved it, took great care of it, but it failed anyway. not samsung nor world wide distributors will do any help whatsoever. i didn't even want a new one, i wanted this one to get fixed. world wide distributors says it's samsungs problem, since their 30 day warranty its expired and i'm sol. samsung says it's world wilde distributors problem, since they sold the phone on the us they are the ones that should fix it. after going back and forth for about 7 days they want the phone shipped to the uk, to see if it can get fixed. say what? spend another $100 and ship the phone to the other side of the planet? wait 3 to 6 months and they're not even sure it will get fixed? i'd rather have them be honest and tell me to shove it up my rear end. plainly put, there isn't and won't be support for this phone, ever. you're better off buying a phone from a major brand name store, whichever you prefer. don't make the same mistake i did. serves me right for trusting samsung and world wide distributors .   provides a wide satisfaction is a smart phone first. highly recommended, enjoy. excelente telefono inteligente brinda una amplia satisfaccion, es un smart phone de primera. altamente recomendado, disfrutenlo .   firstly love the color pebble blue don't know much about the phone but love my apps that i have downloaded great picture quality and smooth sound quality mi just a gwaan play with it until mi understand it zeen. this cellphone is much cheaper than the s4 and are almost the same specifications. it's better to buy it. i recommend you .   my sister can't stop talking about her phone, has actually stopped carrying her laptop to work, even with the gs4 out this is a great phone. i bought a original samsung siii and you sent me the samsung siii chinese version so i need the return of my money! the original samsung siii is made in corea not in china .   everything i ask it to do it does. does not come with much instructions though. guess everything is on the phone. although it appears in the description it is "unlocked phone", all the software is tied to at & t. disappointed .   this product is a tool of work and i`m feel very good whit the funtions and aplications. congratulation to the person that showed for me. this phone is great and has different aplication that are important to the job and compared to other smartphones in my opinion can not say which is better but this works very well. the operation is relative to the need and for my needs this is perfect .   the cosmetic damage was a little more than anticipated but the phone was correct and works well. it was shipped quickly and i was very pleased. when i purchased my galaxy it was because they advertise it as if it is just as good as ios system for apple, but let me tell you it freezes all the time, won't load pictures occasionally and it is a pain in the ass, wish i had an iphone right now .   the phone is not unlocked, which i could not use it. when you send a message to the seller who replied me, i'm still waiting for the key to unlock. not recommend since i was buying a phone unlocked and it is not .   it's user friendly, great camera.met my expectations except for battery life and poor music loading,i phones are much better in these areas. i have used it for 6months. it's a great toy though .   very happy with it. great size screen. touch screen works well. functions work well. battery life is acceptable. to tell the truth, not sure why someone would go for the siv .   got it on time, it works great according to my brother who i bought it for as a gift , he loves it and prefer it over an iphone  .   these are fake samsung galaxy 3's .  save your $$ and go elsewhere .   this company is a scam. i took this phone to a reputable phone repair shop and they took it apart to discover that it is a fake .  you can't get parts even when something goes wrong. i have had this thing for about 45 days and it is junk .  if i could give it 0 stars i would. i have contacted amazon and started the appeal process. taking this man to court if i have to .   i bought this unlocked international phone and it was dead within two months. this phone does not come with warranty and even the samsung themselves could not repair it as it was an international version. the phone got switched off and it never turned back on. i gave the phone to a third party repair store. they told me that its motherboard is gone and no way that i could repair it without spending large bucks. eventhough the seller turned me down, amazon helped me for a refund. if you are still looking to buy this phone, god bless you .   i wanted to change the color of the phone in the first week but i was told by the customer care that they do not have that color. when inquired about returning the item .  i was told that there will be 15% charge. since i do not have any option .  i have the phone. it was great, as expected. i was concerned because i had read many reviews saying that the telephones were from a&t. but this one was factory unlocked, no signs, no brands. so far, it has performed excellent coming from blackberry, this is awesome :). the phone is very nice .   works perfect in venezuela with movistar. great camera, programs, fast and light. one of the best phones right now. it emits a "ding" sound every time an e-mail is received, despite my having set sound notifications to "silent", i just don't how to stop this thing making this annoying noise .   otherwise, it seems like a perfectly adequate phone - i still prefer to do web surfing on a computer of some kind. the camera is ok. sorry i don't get excited about technology any more, all these devices turn out to be more of a nuisance than a help .   cool handset everything works as described. able to use it in my country with no probs at all. :d :d. the device doesn't work on the 1700 band which is t-mobile's 4g network (usa) you will see e,g,3g,h,h+ , all these are very slow compared to true 4g. if data speed is important to you make sure to order the specific model that works with your carrier .   the team works well with movistar venezuela, positive comments from other users are little at the amazing performance of the equipment, which until now have reviewed. el equipo trabaja bien con movilnet venezuela, los comentarios positivos de otros usuarios parecen cortos ante la increã­ble prestaciã³n del equipo, que hasta ahora se han revisado .   sensasional phone. a stylish design, but a little big. it is a very advanced, with extraordinary functions. very happy with purchase .   easy to work, amazing picture and video quality. good looks, effective touch screen, all around a great phone. would recommend to anyone .   it has many languages including chinese in it, which is what i bought it for. video playing is fast. the pictures are nice. no 'at&t' on the back cover like some other samsung galaxy 3. the battery is not bad as i expected. one shortcoming is the manual; it's in a language other than english or chinese, which i can't understand at all. the other shortcoming is still about the language. it has some pre-installed apps in it; the apps are also in the language i can't understand. i can't delete those apps, i can only hide them .   this was an awesome buy, price was great and the phone works well. it was unlocked and i just had to put in my chip and go .   def will buy again .   no fault in phone but charger fail it .  charger take alot of time to charge .  i love the phone but hate the charger .   i bought it from tech giant who was fulfilled by amazon and the phone is unlocked just as it's advertised but i ain't so sure if the phone is actually new because the box for the phone looks really old and used while the phone looks like a new one. another thing is that the phone says that it's made in china and i'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that or if it should be made in korea. it still has s-voice and everything just maybe made in china .   we needed it to be the international version, to have all the applications in the cell diponibles. the code of the cell was gt-i9300, which was gt-i9305 delivered; here in venezuela we were told there was an international version and therefore does not raise the 3g. very good product, i didnt have problem, is importar producto for de people. is complement for me in my life. this gadget really is a smartphone, samgsun does a excellent job in this phone. and now with the new act of android 4.2.2 this phone becomes again in a competitive phone. waiting patiently for amazon's price on the s4 to become more affordable so i can upgrade. my judgement was made from a comparison with an iphone 4 which i also own. mico p. - trinidad and tobago. excellent product, i like this phone, only one observation is that the phone is a little slow processor. thank you. unbelievable i always hear people talking about smart phones but i never pay attention on it until now i have my samsung galaxy s3 and believe me a great phone sorry but i just dump my bb torch 9810. works really well. bought it to use with straight talk. at this time i can't use data on it for straight talk because it is a 4g phone but hopefully soon, just use the wifi. also had to get my sim card cut to use but but that is ok as well .   i actually enjoyed my galaxy s3 immensely. but after eight months it simply died without warning. look it up: it's the galaxy sudden death syndrome. this is especially common in this specific model with 16gb. no one is taking responsibility for this. not surge telecom. not samsung. not amazon. money down the drain. i'm never buying samsung again .   this is probably one of the best purchases that i've made in a long time. this phone is everything that i expected and more. not only is it internationally unlocked but it has all of the apps available to you as if i bought it in the states. i use it for everything that you can think of to use a phone for. i can't find anything to complain about my galaxy s3 .   run away from samsung, amazon and hasslefree  .   it is called international version but there is no warraty, neither local (us) or international. i bought the phone in us and brought it with me to brazil. after 60 days of use the phone just stopped. i tryed support from samsung in brazil and us but none accepted the phone to be serviced. samsung in brazil said the warranty was not valid in brazil. samsung usa said the version was not intended to be used in us so they did't serve the model in us. i tryed amazon and the seller hasslefreecell. amazon just said they coul not help because had passed more than 30 days and hasslefreecell, after my insisting emails nad calls, accepted to get the phone to be repaired. i sent the phone to us at my expenses and waited for more than 30 days to have a solution. finally, when i got the phone back, i realized it came with the screen all marked and even cracked .   it's a nice device - lots of great features, but it does not print to any printer except samsung printers .   very powerful and neat machine. especially given the price and screen size; it's a good buy. you need tweak a little to optimize the ram usage if you are a heavy user. also battery does not last very long like any other smart phone at this age .   i love my new phone and all that it has. it is amazing and i received it just in time and manner .   thanks, good purchase and delivery - the international aspect of the phone means centigrade weather and day/month/year but this is pretty minor and probably good mental exercise anyway .   excelente. this was bought as a gift and it was absolutely loved. the price was ok as well. this is a must have .   i have placed the order for samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version but i received samsung galaxy siii/sgh-1747 .   this phone is not as fast as i expected it to be at all .   as more applications are down loaded the mobile progressively turns slower and slower, despite the fact that enough internal memory is available. returning home from any application takes several seconds. in some occasions the phone restarts by itself. the samsung voice app cannot be used with handsfree earplugs. and samsung doesn't honor the warranty in venezuela because the phone was not meant for use in latinamerica .   the s3 is the perfect pone great sound great screen and the aplications are fast really glad with my purchase. just received phone few days ago and even its written "factory unlocked " the phone is actually from european o2 network and then unlocked. i am very disappointed and since i'm buying all my phones online i will think twice before ordering another one.  .   this is i747 for at&t unlock those are different phone the case donnnot like refurbished~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~when i got it the package just havethe phone and charger ã€‚. good, the next email is to make mention of my displeasure with you to buy my s3, since i bought it with the specifications and to be used released internationally, and i got the same blocked, i wrote several emails and made fools , giving me a bizarre answers, so the catalog as lousy dealer or seller who offered unlocked phone is a lie .   and also i add that cost me $ 45 to unlock my phone in venezuela, so you should take care of my extra expense .   this cell phone was for my daughter that lives in costa rica and it is working wonderful, my daughter don't have any complaints .   bien. i purchase s3 phone for my mother and she is really happy using new phone. ringtone of the phone are not that good but we can use our own rington. otherwise phone in overall is really good. best in low price .   the phone is a chinese version similar to s3, not like the truth and sell it at the price of the original. not specify the type of phone, i need to return. after a long time looking for a good phone, i decided to buy the s3. i bought the "samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version" but i received the gt-i9305t, which is very good and works in brazil, that was my concern. i'm very happy with my purchase .   i love mi cel phone that i bought in amazon. it is exactly what i need. i can download whatever applications i like or dislike; that's ok because i have a lot of memory. it synchronized with mi hotmail and other applications that i download and also have other functions that are really cool. for know i don't have any problem with my phone. however, i would prefered if i could sent it to lima, peru instead to miami, usa .   i got this phone as a gift for my father and he is absolutely loving it. he was looking for jelly bean v1.1.2 and this phone had ice cream sandwich v1.0, but he did an upgrade and its on latest os .   probably the best phone i've had in my life. despite the fact that sold already the s4, it is still very much alive. very good display, storage and performance. very good product. my favorite one .   promptly responsded to inquiries before and after sales and guaranteed the product also .   before and after the sale. the phone is great. i had iphone from the first to the 4s and always had issues. the latest was an apple update which made the iphone useless .   the samsung so far if great .   can't say that i will ever go back to apple now that i've tried android/ samsung. had other androids before this one, none were good .   till the galaxy siii. definitely buy .   this is the second phone i brought, i brought the first one for my husband in december for christmas it worked just fine. about two months later he accidentally dropped it in the ocean, since he was happy with it was a no brainer i went back to amazon and make sure i brought another one from the same seller. i basically brought the same phone, unfortunately the phone has been nothing but problems, they is something major wrong with the wireless setting. we called the seller and have been placed on hold until i got tired. i am never buying anything from this seller again. the best cel that i have it .  very fast downloads.as international versiã³n it recognize all my accounts in seconds.full recommended .  i love it .   just got and it's work perfectly! it super light, it came in english, but with options to other languages. i have at&t sim chip and it worked fine (i had to change it for a micro sim tough, but they did for free at at&t store). not regret at all .   great phone, great camera, lots of apps. get a good case for it if you give this to a teenager, mine had it for two weeks, dropped it and cracked the screen .   a good case is worth the money .   the product received does not correspond to the product manufacture. we performed the purchase of a samsung galaxy siii and instead was given two car chargers.that is one product is billed and received another which does not correspond in price or features .   i was very lucky to get one of them. after 7 months of use, my s3 started to reset itself or hang. i am really disappointed .   this guy sold me a copy chinese and made â€‹â€‹me think it was original. i need my money back or change it to me .   hi guys, i just bought this phone and i like it a lot.its touch screen performance is very sensitive and good.besides the os of galaxy s3 is upgraded so the apps performance is great and the navigation is so cool as well.the best part i can take a burst of pictures from the camera and select the best one out. its so cool. thanks all .   i'm using it for almost 8 months and just don't see any issues or troubles with the phone. the functionality is just what i need, screen resolution is enough for email reading and internet browsing. battery is strong enough to hold energy for a day of extensive use and charging with standard charger is fast enough. gorilla glass works as advertised - no scratches after usage in pretty severe conditions. the phone was also used during very cold season (average temp during winter minus 15 degrees, sometimes 20-25 below zero) - saw no glitches and battery also hold it's power .   the major issue is that the battery does not last long enough. just got the phone about a month ago and the battery barely lasts for a full day even with turning off most of the applications .   this is my second s3 (the first one fell and broke) and i love this phone. also with the s4 out this one is cheaper now .   best time to buy a good product is when manufacturer releases a new version. got it at an unbeatable price .   the phone works fine when all of it's parts are attached. the volume control button fell off almost immediately after we installed the sim card in italy. it has many features, but the more things that are attached to an electronic device, the more there are to go wrong. i'm going back to uncomplicated phones. the simpler the better. i bought an old samsung burner phone in naples for â‚¬19.90, and a tim sim card for â‚¬10, and it worked just fine all over switzerland and italy .   i brought the international version gt-i9300 but i received the us version (at&t carrie ) i'm very disappointed. many people are complaining about it .   the samsung galaxy siii is a great phone, have great apps and the touchscreen is fabulous .   just love it all .   i live outside the usa, and i ordered the international version of samsung galaxy siii phone. they said very clearly that it was unlocked. thatâ€™s why i bought it. i asked them to send it to my relatives' address to bring it to me on their vacation. i was happy that it arrived on time. but i was really disappointed to find out that it was locked. super cell. fast, beautiful, versatile. excellent price. i love it. i recommend it. this article is the maximum. amazon is an excellent platform to find what you are looking for good price and quality .   this phone is exactly what i needed. i travel a lot and the last time i carried a camera, it was stolen from my suitcase. therefore, i've decided not to buy a camera, but i needed a phone that took good pictures. that's the main reason i bought the samsung s3, and it takes great pictures. even georeferenced it your gps is on .   the phone i received is french version, the charger is not suitable in the us outlet,so i had to buy another charger and the instruction book is written in french. however the phone is very good. i love the phone .   the google nexus 4 would have been a far more sound choice at $350, but it has no micro sd slot, which would cost $0.05 to add and its exclusion is intolerable. off course google, wants you stream everything through the cloud and of course buy it from them so they don't want users havin no stinkin expandable storage. so the most comparable phone with expandable storage is this the galaxy s3. but man does the price hurt in comparison. the only real disappointment was that it cannot play hi10p and if you don't know what that is, you wont have any complaints about a galaxy s3. well maybe that it isn't an s4 .   really nice this device. i am just waiting for the android 4.2.2 notify by samsung. very nice camera and screen quality. the samsung galaxy s3 is a very nice phone, the smartest phone in the world. i am very happy with that. it has a lot of apps to work and to play games also .   i bought the g3 primarily to use as a gps on my motorcycle and send the audio to my helmet via bluetooth. it worked great. my only complaint of the g3 is that the home screen does not rotate like all other screens and that it seems to go through the battery quicker than other phones and needs charged at least onece a day. the audio quality during calls is good. the size makes it challenging for one handed operation if you have smaller hands .   i got the phones next day for free, they were packaged well and easy to activate on my current network. they work as well as the network phones. i'm also glad they can work wherever i travel without having to be unlocked. great buy for the value .   is fantastic. i love it. the product is exact as described and works really fine. the only thing is that i need to wait for 4g in my country to start using the max speed .   i ordered ceramic white but got marble white.it should be factory unlocked but my sim is not working in that.also the s" button written in samsung" on the back of phone is ripped of.screen protector was attached when i got the phone. t mobile logo appears when i turn on the phone. i completely don't trust its a new phone. this is totally insane. totally wrong product .   is a great phone comparable to iphone, easy access, good resolution camera, and a wizard who understands everything you say xd. amazing, compliant with specifications and arrived as scheduled. offered all desired functionalities, practical for international users (unlocked). definitely recommend it .   excellent phone very good, i like their features and is the world's telephone etter thanks for sale, good, good, good. product exactly as described. i love using it. it was money well spent! i can't get enough of it and i would recommend it to everyone .   this was item should not be sold. the phone face glass was broken and had no battery, it was just the shell they were selling for over almost $300.00. be very careful of evryhingcellular. i thing amozon should stop using them because it make them looks bad .   a great smart phone! it does every thing what was expeted. i my oppinion no need spent extra money for a s4 model .   i am appealing to all persons buying phones on amazon from worldwide distibutors be careful. they are selling phones made in hungary with all instructions not in english. my experience after purchasing phone from amazon (worldwide distributors) after 2 months the phone was no longer working, it just went off, after testing battery which was good, i realized i was sold a faulty phone. i wrote amazon and worldwide distributors on three occassions and all amazon did is to keep referring me to worldwide distributors. worldwide distributors keep referring me samsung. samsung couldn't help since they cannot understand how the phone count out so quickly. i am stocked with a phone costing me $534.00 us after just 2 months with no help from both amazon and worldwide distributors. to this day amazon never tried to help me or even apologise to me for selling me a "lemon". i will not even think of purchasing anything from amazon again until this problem is solved. i am seeking a new authentic samsung galaxy phone to replace the faulty one i now have. i have informed all the persons i know not to buy on amazon, because they do not take care of customeres when they are sold faulty products please heed this call customers .   this is by far one of the best smart phones i've had in my life. just a word of advice if you want to go through verizon pre paid service they will not let you since it is a 4g lte phone which is stupid .   the phone itself is def wht i was looking for. a lil over priced but its not bad at all .   surprisingly fast shipment, phone worked flawlessly, all the accessories where there and worked as they should. i had to return it not because there was anything wrong with the phone, i wasn't aware that international versions of phones doesn't really work well with us carriers because the bandwidth they use is different as the rest of the world. i contacted them and explained why i had to return it and in 5-10 mins they approved me to return it. even issuing the refund was pretty fast and without any issue. i wouldn't hesitate if i had to buy from this company again, really professional and responsible .   i bought the samsung galaxy s3 the first week of may. the phone was functioning perfectly, but two weeks later the phone suddenly died. it was never hit or scratch, always protected with a case. i took the phone to the technical service and they told me the motherboard was damage, without any reasonable explanation. i am really mad with the decision i took of buying this phone. fixing the phone almost cost me the same as the new one. the damage is apparently caused by a software problem .   samsung seal was broken and had another label trying to hide it. phone had fingerprints everywhere, plastic was on crooked. phone was advertised as new, so i'm sending this back. hard to tell if anything is authentic. i had a brand new s3 from a previous employer and know how everything should look when it comes from the factory and it isn't like this .   i think that this is a great product, works great, all the apps runs quickly, the camera take great pictures .   my cell phone is not complete .   the headphones are missing .   they were not in the box, the instructions are not the original, it's a simple copy, it's not as seller show in the picture .  i feel scammed .   i am from costa rica and i have been buying things online for more than 4 years and i have never experienced something like what happened with this seller. i bought a samsung galaxy s3, as described in the product's title, but when the product arrived, i realize this isn't the product i purchased, i received an android gt a7100, which is the s3's chinese version  .   this is an outrage. i have talked to the seller and they insist that they sent the right cellphone and the problem lies with the courier, something everyone here in costa rica knows it's practically impossible. aeropost, my courier, does not touch the contents of the packages that are sent and they are not open until it is delivered. it's not possible that out of 35 negative reviews, most of them deal with the same problem. today, march 20th, 2013, history repeats itself with this seller. i'm disgusted and i believe amazon should do something with this seller quickly and find a way to avoid this type of repeated mistakes. as of right now, nothing has been solved .   i had an iphone 4 and i thought that was the ultimate phone. when i saw a friend of a friend using the galaxy one evening .  the screen was brighter and bigger, and it was doing all the stuff my little iphone could do. i decided to purchase this phone and give it a try .  i am now hooked. it is superior to the iphone in every way. bigger and brighter screen, s voice commands that can open apps, text messages, take dictation, open the camera, etc., customizable vibration notifications, (intensity, duration, pattern). if this phone gets lost or stolen, not only can you find it .  there is also a sim alert .  meaning that if someone takes out your sim and puts theirs in, you will get an email that tells you what their phone number is. there are seven home screens to which you can add widgets. you can also open and see two apps at a time on the same screen. the alarm can wake you up in briefing mode .  meaning that the alarm will brief you on the weather, the news, and your schedule for the day instead of just an alarm tone. this phone is amazing. i've had it for about a month now and would never ever go back to iphone .   the samsung galaxy s iii is one of the best smart phones available. this is a truly unlocked version with latest android updates readily available. you don't have to wait for at&t to release the update. the only problem is this is not 4g lte. its 3g and i am ok with that. the customer service is extremely good and they put forth the facts honestly! also don't worry about the phone starting in german, you just have to select english language and it is as good as any other s iii. great price, got what i was expecting. reliable, safe and beautiful. i love so much the product. im very happy about my purchase. there's a reason why the galaxy siii is one of the best phones in the world. i love mine! having loads of storage helps for piling on the useful apps. i couldn't be happier with my purchase .   i love the big screen. nothing i can say bad about this fon. this is the best fon i ever had .   i'm really statified this phone but battery is not good. but very good for me to used and this phone is unlocked phone but i did. i'm from brazil and this smartphone works for all brands here, (vivo, oi, claro,tim ) very fast and have many features for samsung smart tv also, his a.i. is incredable, the syncronize with all social networks aggregating with each contact that you have is amazing, photo shots very fast with a good resolution, it's better than iphone so far .   excellent, it met all my expectations. thanks you. great a marvel. this phone is the worst desicion. i had an iphone 4, i thought it got old so i decided to buy galaxy s3, my bad. is bad quality, the os is unstable i had many problems. i am waiting for iphone 6. it worked perfectly even though i bought it in the states and i'm using it in argentina .  great phone i like it a lot. great phone at a good price and it was really unlocked. i will soon by one more for my family .   it was the product purchased, they sent me a different model while a galaxy s3 is not indicating the publication is an i9300. i received a samsung sgh-i747 which has a dual core processor direfencia lower than the i9300 has a quad-core, has no radio, is a model of at & t. do not agree with what is received as it is not what you buy .   i bought this phone a few day ago, and was thrilled when it arrived. so crisp and clean. i took it to the local verizon store only to find out it is not compatible. super upset about it, i only give it three stars for not being compatible with verizon .   i purchased this phone to use internationally in korea .   it's a dream. only thing (and this has nothing to do with the phone) i couldn't believe it was cheaper for me to buy a samsung phone on amazon and have it shipped here when samsung is a korean company. plain-o bonkers .   get this phone .   you'll be happy .   thanks sir williams beacause you solve the issue .   so i think you did a great job to solve the problem .   great phone, i'm familiar with ios and i have to agree with the fact that android is great peace of software. the phone is slick and trendy, i wish it had more battery. you can add up as much memory you want so it does not matter the internal memory of the phone to start with. the cam is good for what you want to use it for (i mean, it's not an slr cam!). would not accept sim chip as it would not lock into place broken sim cover, overall shoddy workmanship and i would not recommend. i received this phone very fast. which was very expensive and not really worth it is the tax that is levied in my country .   this smartphone is awesome. its user friendly, very fast, impresive responsive, very light despite the large size. i recommend it. another great phone from samsung. wanted to buy the s4 but i think i will wait until they release the note 3 and try that one out .   we bought this phone for our grandson so we were skeptical because of some of the negative reviews about it not being the unlocked, international version. it arrived today and we are thrilled with it. it was exactly what they advertised, factory unlocked (still sealed in the box), international version. it came ups air, next day delivery (free). not sure what some of these folks are talking about on their negative reviews but this vendor is great and the product is great. price was nice as well .   this phone is excellent, great product, here in venezuela is awesome, my espectavives was super, very thankfull for the service and the product. having owned a vast number of cellphones myself from different brands and using different os i'm forced to recommend this one, not only because it absolutely met my expectations but because it shows how a great product, with a great design and a fantastic software implementation can be put out there for a fair price .   samsung love it, keep making awesome phones .   proud that this is a korean product, forget the iphone .   this is way worth the $ .   i've got 2 cell phones .   but one of them have the earpiece like loose, and the battery doesn't work .   probably that is the reason why in the box there are two batterys .   and the package was delivered one day after the estimated date, after i asked to the seller what happened .   it's too bad, because i've got others new unlocked phones, and everything is perfect .   i don't know exactly how is working the other phone that i' ve got. great cell phone, this is international version and look so nice work perfect , in every sense, come in french but i speak french too and is very easy turn to any lenguaje , i so happy with this purchase come super fast. i took this to vietnam, bought a sim card and work out of the box. i love it. i would recommend to buy it .   phone is great, but int'l unlocked version did not work well on at&t in the us. problems with texts not arriving on several occasions. phone worked well for demos .   i recomended. this phone is too fast and have a clean software. android jajaj is the best. the games is so good. i got just what i ordered and it was delivered on time not a day later. phone was in great condition and works like a charm. thank you .   everything about him is perfect, the only problem is the battery, but not cell problem, a problem of samsung and general smarthaphones. i love the phone, very quick, nice shape and you can set the language to brazilian portuguese. works perfectly in brazil  .   i did not had to change my number. the only trouble is not related to the phone itself, but to the sim card. i had to cut it to fit. 5 starts  .   too slow! not what u would expect from samsung! my 3rd galaxy, loved the others, but this one is defective and my money is wasted! bummer. i ordered the international phone and got something else that only takes small sim cards. don't buy this phone if you want to receive what was advertised. i use this for work and am extremely disappointed. i love it! this is what i wanted to get and everything. galaxy 3s is really great item. you should get it too  .   excellent .   so far, i love this phone. i upgraded from the galaxy sii i9100 and am thankful that i did so. i love the larger screen and added features. do not regret this purchase at all .   good cellphone, the only bad thing i haveto say is about the signal in venezuela for movistar .   sucks .   and .   i think the phone does not help at all. the phone is perfect in every way. dont buy an iphone. instead buy this one that is one of the best cell phones i have ever have .   there are a number of important details that do not appear in the publication, such as the model that really sells t-mobile sgh-t999 and not the gt-i9300 international version. no doubt the gt-i9300 is better. therefore it is not the phone that is published .   for an iphone user: this cell phone is really an experience! i used an iphone for a long time but now i really like to explore the possibilities the samsung offers. it is a great phone! i do have some critics for the seller though: we did not receive ceramic white, but marble white, the phone was set up in french and the charger was german (but they added an adapter). i had the iphone 3gs and therefore a bigger sim, couldnt someone tell me that the sim cards are smaller now .   i cut it and it works! yeah .   the phone is definitely a go .   good morning the phone i get the empty box my phone was not yet. it is not fair that i buy and i arrived the empty box. am satisfied from the product and the shipment. however, the exchange rate used by amazon was far higher then the official exchange rate.amazon has charged me e. r. of 3.87 shekels per 1 usd while the official e.r. was 3.62, which means almost 7%(!) higher! why .   i hv purchased : smasung galaxy s3 and battery for dell laptop + some accessoroes. thanks, david emunah .   this phone does everything you need and more. i love the big screen and the smoothness with which you navigate through it .   very good phone in a very good price price ver what you get is amazing very good camera very good screen very good price(: work very fast. it's a good phone. still in the top. it has some problems and bugs and i've heard about sudden death .   bought this as a continuum to my galaxy . my old phone was so ruggedly used without a cover. sadly, i overestimated this new product, its the bad sheep of the galaxy family and the screen broke with the first fall it faced! my old galaxy had at the most a dent with similar fall. replacement of the not original screen is 170$ min .   not happy at all :'(. this is not what i paid, this phone is used, are so brazen that they erased the photos or the music of the former owner that cynical bulgares .   i received the phone and i realized that was not original. has only 500mb of ram. not have the resolution of an original product. you can not install samsumg applications. not 4 bands. the gps does not work. the page samsumg not recognized. the materials should be metal on the phone are plastic. the samsung glaxy s3 is very good. the quality is good and have tools for day by day. the support of samsung is good .   this is a very fast cellphone, works perfectly and has an amazing camera. totally recomended .   great hd screen. buy it .   though if you want to use it with t-mobile, don't. it didn't work well with t-mobile but i got excellent reception with best buy's at@t. it's not the phone's fault but the provider's. i just had a very very bad experience with t-mobile, their reception, and their customer's service. never again .   even if you are the middle person you must still sell the product by telling the consumers all that they need to know do not just take the item as face value. there were some things on this item that was not mentioned in the selling points that were important and with that being said is why this item was returned. liked it or not all of the information was not given before purchase. and the restocking fees are ridiculas, any store still gets there money with the box open or not no moneies are lost. i will buy this item but from some one else who will tell all that is needed to know not when i receive it. so for this i give this company a low 2 stars. nine months latter .   i had a terrible surprise, my phone was damaged. the "cpu" runs out of battery even with the battery saying 53% or more. it shuts itself constantly and the battery only last three hours if you just use the phone. if you use video, gps, or anything else it only holds for 20 minutes. waste of money, don't buy it. i try to fix it in brazil, but they told me, beside it has only 9 months i had no warranty. so i tryed to pay the repair and they don't have the parts for that .   my gt-i9300 displays an error when opening the camera "unknown error occured". no entry in the internet solution to solve the problem .   this is an amazing phone, very fast and great resolution. the best was the price, not to expensive as i found at stores. when i qualified i had thought that the phone was right, it was the i9300. the phone out and took it to the dealer samsung and told me that was not the i9300 but i747. and i confirmed what i had been scammed and cheated. the phone was configured by software as a i9300, but is actually a i747. me i feel really mocked with purchase i did. also the phone is faulty often. i require that men get a response regarding a refund for mis-selling .   excellent product nice screen now i know what they call s,art phones battery last long and speakers are loud enough great value. got this for the gf and she is addicted. only issue i have with this phone is the battery life, but with the quality that it pushes out it's somewhat understandable. just get an extra battery if needs be .   well this was was definitely a great buy. works great, completely unlocked. mine was originally in french but i quickly changed it to english using the menu options. was even able to rot it in under 3 minutes. the phone itself has rather short battery life but that's a samsung issue. it comes just as advertised in immaculate condition. great phone and i'm enjoying it immensely .   i bought a samsung galaxy s3 i9300 unlocked, but what i got, after they had to resend the package using fedex because apparently usps "lost it" on its way, was a galaxy s3 sgh-i747 on an i9300's box, without manuals nor headphones, just the phone, which came with the home button loose and kind of as if it's always pressed, and (at least) the charger .   this phoen is amazing .   greta tecnology, easy to use and lots of multi functions .  it comparable to a iphone, with the benefits you won't find at appple products (when you are tide to use apps, storage cards, etc). the product was received and checked. everything was perfect. excelent price. and as some people was saying, this product is not in german when first use. you can choose the language. i recommend .   i find myself in unusual position praising iphone :-) i bought galaxy siii for my brother overseas, who replaced his iphone 4 or 4s. there are many things he likes about galaxy siii; however, he seriously considers changing it to iphone 5. i donâ€™t know why, but it is a fact. my wife is quite happy with galaxy siii, but she never had iphone .   came the next day and worked out of the box. i use it in china and works well. comes with european charger. this is an excellent phone and i am glad i bought it. however, i have not been able to register it for a warranty. 1) no reply at all from the seller about this, 2) samsung us will not register it because it is not a us phone or from a local carrier, 3) samsung us told me to track the original country of origin (from the imei) which turned out to be hong kong - samsung hong kong will not let me register it because it is not tied to a local hk carrier. so to date, my phone is not covered by the warranty, even though it should be since it was purchased legally, and heaven forbid anything should happen to it .   best phone so far, the camera is the best part, no other camera and shoot as fast as this phone. the screen quality is extremely good. the phone is thin and the screen is big enough to play games and read emails. for some reason when i play high quality games, the phone gets extremely hot.the battery last a long time compared to other phones. i would of like different color options. it works perfectly! i brought it to venezuela and everything is perfect! im very excited with this new pone. very good. excelent. nice looking phone .   i bought it for my gf daughter who live in the ukraine .   she specifically asked for this phone. her friends recommended it .   this smart phone up to my expectations exceeded.it is light, handy, nice, with countless applications and resources.i would have to write an article to express the many facets and the multiple facets of this extraordinary smart phone and i have no time for it. the phone is awsome i love it .  they delivered as per my expectations but it will be great if i received a cover and screen protector .  i have to buy it  .   i bought this phone to go to t-mobile prepaid from metro pcs and when i activated it, all i saw was a e symbol on my service bar. never got 4g because the phone doesn't get the correct umts bands since it's mostly gsm. so unless you want to go to t-mobile with 1/2.5g service i recommend not buying this phone .   it's so sad too because this phone was a lot faster and had the full jellybean update that t-mobile s3 doesn't. >:( grrrr. going to wait for the s4 to come out for now .   awesome, its a gift for my wife .  hope she will like it too .  thanks hasslefree cell .  thanks for your quick customer feed back. i thought this was going to be a protection to the body of my phone. nope. i ended up buying asmyna samsiiicaskca602 premium slim and durable protective cover for samsung galaxy s3. it looks nice and it covers my screen .   but that's all .   and not a good value for the price .   i live in perãº, this unlocked international version phone works perfectly. and is a great looking phone and it works perfectly. its very fast'and the battery lasts longer than i expected .   i got this phone on time and when i opened the box it was brand new.amazing phone. it was as advetised 32gb .   seller was hasslefree cell and i would defo reccomend it to a friend .  soon as i got this one my gf is tryin to take it from me .  im thinkin to order another one from the same seller .   fantastic cell phone, it arrived in very good conditions w/o any problem and it is working fantastic my wife love it .   super fast phone, you can do almost whatever you want. customizable and intuitive. i strongly recommended if you are an android fan. i was using this phone around 10 months after that the phone started to freezing .   can somebody tell how to claim the warranty .   the price was decent, the product was as described. great phone i used it while traveling in europe and back home in the states .   this product attend me perfectly! beautiful design, soft and sensitive touch. i am satisfected with this product i have bought .   el producto llegã³ antes de la fecha indicada y la caja estaba sellada. estoy muy satisfecha con la compra! definitivamente volverã© a hacer negocios con este vendedor. muy atento tambiã©n. saludos desde vzla. before this phone i had a nexus i9250, and is not much difference between them, the biggest difference is the screen, you can see the improvement in sharpness, another visible improvement is the design as it is more pleasing to the eye, a drawback of the phone is the battery life, in my case i have to charge up to 3 times a day with the nexus were 2 times, the seller "surgetelecom" sent me exactly what is described, everything in perfect condition, shipping was in record time very pleased with the choice i made. what i donâ¨t like is by the time i bought the phone's price fell $ 70, so i was not pleased  .   antes de este telã©fono tuve un nexus i9250 , y no es mucha la diferencia entre ellos , la mayor diferencia es la pantalla , se puede ver la mejora en la nitidez, otra mejora visible es el diseã±o ya que es mas agradable a la vista , un punto en contra del telã©fono es la baterã­a en mi caso la tengo que recargar hasta 3 veces al dã­a con el nexus eran 2 veces , el vendedor "surgetelecom" me enviã³ exactamente lo que esta descrito todo en perfectas condiciones , el enviã³ fue en tiempo rã©cord, muy complacido con la elecciã³n que hice. lo malo fue que para el momento en que compre el precio del telã©fono cayo 70 $, lo que no me agrado  .   i received the product as described. excellent quality fabric. i recommend the product to my family and friends. i love .   great phone works super good fast just as advertised super fast shipping and great packed to protect phone only down sidebit arrived in chinese but after all excellent. after 10 month using this product it dead suddenly -cause by 16g flash controller bug .   .this bug was fixed on 4.1.2 jellybeans but i was not having the opportunity to test that (use 4.1.1 jellybean). i ask the dealer / samsung costumer service for help - no comments .   switching to other manufacturing  .  no more samsung. 27/5/2013 - update i just calling samsung usa and it found to be a hong kong hand set. so i call hong kong 0085236984698 help center and they confirm that because the handset bought online it actually have zero (0) warranty . amazon seller statement is that handset have 1 year warranty with actually zero coverage. thanks great way to sell product . i will look very carefully in the future (if ever) to buy a product using amazon this is a bad bad experience - i just lost 876$ - thank you amazon - grate seller  .   when i purchased the samsung galaxy s3 it supposed to have been unlocked, when i received the phone and attempt to have it actived by my carrier they explained that they could not active it because it may have been stolen. so i contacted the seller to report what my carrier (stated that the phone was stolen) the blubell sales wanted me to go into the phone to the unlock the phone because they claim that they missed the unlocking. the reason why i purchased the phone because i wanted a unlocked phone for traveling. i returned the phone, now blubell sales wants to charge me a restocking fee. this was fuse advertising the phone was not as advertise and i don't think i should pay a restocking fee. (i had to purchase another phone because i couldn't active the phone that i purchased from blubell sales) my tips do not get involved with them .   i was looking for a good cell phone and i ended with a perfect one! no complaints at all. perfect size, processor, memory and performance .   the team was helpful after sale so they do the best to fix any problem i faced like the thin battery which i switched for a new one. i own a galaxy nexus and the s3 and i prefer my nexus over the s3, but i guess it is just because i owned the nexus first and got used to its interface. it is lighter and keep nexus size which i consider a pro, but as a big con, you have to wait longer for android updates .   "not comment on the description that came with the 220v charger and now i have to invest for a 110v charger." for sold by: techno.trading.house. i don know why came the 220v charger, here american use 110v .   i dont like iphones and i had a blackberry before. i thought that i would not adapt as i like having a physical keyboard and it is a big phone but i love it  .   thank i really loved it, and the price was worth it. great image quality and sound also. i am happy that i've bought it. super phone. very slick looking, fast and user friendly. nice colour. the only problem is the international version will arrive set in a different language .  this video shows you how to change to english or another preferred language[ .  ] otherwise perfect .   love the features and sleek design.didn't regret of buying it.enjoying it so much.before, i was planning to buy a iphone. but in the end, i decided to buy this and never regret it .   todo excelente con el producto enviado. muchas gracias el envio fue perfecto. llego de muy buena manera al pais. ok. i am a apple fan used iphone for a very long time. the galaxy s3 phone fit my vonvenience and i do not miss the iphone for even a second and at great price. very good phone, i recommend it for anyone that needs to be connected everytime. good design, excellent screen size, and very easy to use .   the sophistication of the design and technology make the phone is better than i-phone. the sleek design as well as automatic power saver feature are superb. lo recomiendo el equipo llego en excelentes condiciones, sin ningãºn tipo de problemas, y con todos sus accesorios tambiã©n funcionando sin problemas. my phone works perfect with the local carrier, i have had no issues with it, i'm incredibly happy with my purchase .   excelent .  this company was very professional and the product was in excelent conditions .  we received it on time and everything was ok .   love the sevice, attention, speed of delivery and overall i love the item i go from you. it is a gift, i am sure my niece will enjoy .   el producto llego al timepo estimado, sin ningu problema, nuevo y con los sellos de nuevo, que garantiza lo original del producto. galaxy s3 - international version purchased from global mobile 3/2013 first and foremost: phone does not work with verizon or sprint. could have saved me a lot of time and worry if the product description said it only works with tmobile and at&t. for that reason you lose half a star. took away another half for being shipped late. the shipping date was also never updated until the day it finally shipped, which is the date i was expecting it. i love the phone so much that i can forgive the late shipping and having to switch phone carriers. (i was planning on leaving verizon anyway). this is my third android phone and it is definitely the best so far. the amount tricks you can do just keep increasing. it'll take a while to learn everything this phone is capable of. was concerned about the size. but my small girly hands have no problems. strongly recommend a case as the sleek design made me nervous i'd drop it. best thing about purchasing an unlocked phone is not having to deal with all the bloat-ware that the carriers install on their phones. no annoying apps that you can't delete. did come with a bunch of german apps. but i was able to delete them with no problems. if you've never used an android or aren't technically savy, it may take awhile for you to get the hang of it. all in all i'm glad i bought this phone. i got the phone i've always wanted. at nearly half the price. left verizon for tmobile. looking forward to a much cheaper phone bill. definitely worth it. sent from my awesome new galaxy s3 .   i love my s3 it got to me on time and it wss at a great price just wish i could have gotten the 32gig version, also my one complaint is that the charger was the uk jack. but other than that i love it. justamente lo que esperaba, el articulo llego tal cual lo describã­an en la publicaciã³n, lo recomiendo 100%, es una empresa responsable. i was disappointed that there was no manual included. i had to download from internet. other than that, i love the phone. i've used iphones for years. i have a friend who had this phone and i always thought it seemed too big. it's bigger than an iphone but still fits in my back pocket so it's not too big after all. i have had no issues getting any of the apps i had previously on my iphone on my new galaxy but you can use it without any of the restrictions apple places on it's phones. the colors on the phone are amazing. the sound is great. it can automatically sync with your google contacts which is great. one of the reasons that i got rid of my iphone was because of itunes and it not letting me recover my contacts when i had to restore it to it's factory settings (another apple issue). with the galaxy, and any android phone i imagine, you can manage your contacts in gmail and they are never lost! it can also sync to your facebook contacts. depending on which you sync to, the pictures in your contacts list will match the pictures your friends put on their google or facebook. i love that feature. the pictures automatically change when they change them. you can even sync your facebook pictures to your phone. i can't think of anything bad to say about it. i love it .   the link clearly states that it is unlocked. i ordered it, and because i was in a hurry to travel, i didn't even review the phone before i left with it. now that i've finally had time to open the phone and actually try to use it, it shows up as t-mobile locked. i have had this phone for about 6 months now and i still love it! the blue looks really good .   there is a known hw problem with this phone. it can result in sudden death. the phone will die and not restart. mine worked for 6 months .   because this is an international version, samsung usa will not support you and point you to samsung uk. they in turn will also not support you because the phone is not an eu phone. so you are left in limbo. i have been trying to get a straight answer from samsung for weeks, no one knows where to service the phone. samsung's support model is abominable. no one takes ownership or responds. so be forewarned in buying samsung products, support is bad. this is a very good phone with lots of features and is the top notch in terms of technology and usefool tools .   this is a very good phone with lots of features and is the top notch in terms of technology and usefool tools .   they ship the phone as if you bought it out the store. hate the fact that when you buy it unlocked none of the guides (on paper) are in english. the phone itself is awesome works great i love it! nice job. muy buen producto, es un telã©fono muy completo, fã¡cil manejo y bonito diseã±o, definitivamente cumple con mis expectativas, lo recomiendo .   this is an awesome cell phone. it was delivered on time. the box was sealed properly. i hope i can buy the samsung galaxy s iv very soon .   the phone came brand new in a sealed packaged and was delivered promptly. i had no problem setting it up and was able to start using it immediately .   after 8 months my phone has suffered the "sudden death" syndrome. i've been reading and there is nothing i can do, i am not completely sure about the warranty but if my $700 are gone this is my last samsung product, and i have tablets and other products, for me samsung is dead too. glad to hear if someone had a similar problem and found a solution .   i got this bc i was going for a world trip and it worked everywhere without having any trouble. fast and got all my updates. then i end up giving it to someone in india and it works fine. thank you so much. i thought i rate this one but really sorry for the late review. amazing phone i have it over an year already and it still works perfectly. works fast has a lot of memory and a good photo resolution .   i got this phone 3 months ago as a gift for my sister! she has no complain whatsoever with it ,,,. respecto al smartphone solo les puedo decir lo que ustedes ya saben, es un aparatazo! y el envio se concreto muy rapido, me llego en solo 2 dias. i researched the phone a lot before buying. i went on a formum called howards forum and talked to several people there. then i talked to the seller of this phone who gave me helpful info on which phone to get. i was worried about buying the international over the us version. seller said it was better and so did the forums. i have service through a small provider. i have always had a blackberry and had upgraded as soon as the new one came out. we got my mother a samsung because she wanted a smartphone and i loved what she had. galaxy 2. anyway i got my phone 2 days after order was placed. i am not sure why anyone would have problems with the phone being in german. it gives instructions on how to set the phone before you can open the box. box is sealed with the instructions. phone is very fast, pictures are beautiful. camera has none of the lag of other camera phones i have owned have. i practiced on the grand kids today and got very good action shots. everything is set up to send the photos anywhere you want. i will be getting an otterbox cover as i really don't want to damage that beautiful screen .   i seem to be running the battery down fast but i have downloaded lots of apps and pictures so i hope thats it. so far it seems to last one day between charges. but as i say i have been using pretty heavy. so far i would buy this phone again .   excellent phone, great performance and quality of the materials. i haven't got any problem with it and it's been 6 months that i have it .   the best quality smartphone. incredible functionality and unbeatable operating system. i highly recommend if you want quality products for communication and distraction. unsurpassed quality .   good morning the product this one good and in perfect conditions ado that refer says goodbye of you jose diaz. i love this phone very much, and it is very good to be used. the shipping is very fast, and i will recommend others to buy this phone. i think it is better than i phone .   it's a very good phone that i liked very much .  easy to handle most of all the features are superb.so i loved the phone. this item doesn't have any kind of warranty. i bought it just 6 months ago from amazon.com, because i needed an unlocked phone as i use two sims from two different countries. and it just died for no apparent reason. i contacted samsung usa, however, i was told that as it was an international version not sold in the us it wasn't supported either! they proposed me to contact samsung uk. samsung uk told me since i bought the phone in the us they couldn't support me with any warranty, and to go check witn us samsung, which i previously asked and was told to go to samsung uk, so i got in that loop, hence leaving my phone without any warranty no matter what country i am. i just lost my $700 usd i spent in this item .   samsung galaxy s3 has been having lots of hardware problems, to fix mine will cost $500 usd to replace the motherboard not worth it .   warning .   check for "samsung galaxy s3 sudden death syndrome" before considering to buy this phone .   great product, light, beautiful, and a very powerfull machine! it's a very good deal, due the price and quality. i recomend .   simplemente el mejor telefono que he tenido hasta ahora, mejor que el iphone que cualquier blackberry (aunq no he probado el z10) en fin, muy recomendado .   what can i say phone is awesome features to the heavens love it a must have best phone i ever had .   excelente! 100% recomendado, operaciã³n garantizada, con equipo contaba con sus respectivos precintos de seguridad, resguardado. gracias. saludos cordiales desde venezuela .   excelente todo bien, este celular es de primera

loving siii since obeserved my friends using it .   it's incredible product and brings new functionalities to my day .   simply love it .   el que sabe de telefono inteligente sabe que trato de decir cunando me refiero que el mejor telefono que hay en el mercado. very good i vove it it is what i want so nice i like it thans so much it is great. i love my phone and i would not trade it for the world. i have a samsung tablet also and it is just like it. i am very satisfied with samsung products and their quality .   muy contenta con el envio a tiempo y el producto llego en muy buen estado y

and every one of my needs .   well it will be a shame comparing this monster to the iphone. apart from the shape and design (which we may disagree upon) it beats it in every shot. looking forwards for the upcoming s iv. i chose this article because it's at a great price, excellent quality and i recommend it to you. thanks you. the phone is everything i expected and more, arrived within stated time. it was my birthday gift and i am really pleased so far .   excellent negotiation, i would buy one with you. 100% responsible and serious. very good product and very good quality. works well without problems. no complaints as such. i preferred iphone compare to. lets see if they come up with next version with nice resolution .   it's sluggish. maybe cos i have 5k contacts. but damn sluggish. the brightness is too much most of the time. otherwise great .   the best phone i ever had. the best phone in the world! i hate the i-phone!  .   you must to buy this product .   excellent and very good

recomiendo ampliamente para comprar a este vendedor. el equipo llego en perfectas condiciones totalmente nuevo, lo unico malo que el vendedor no envio la factura comercial y la empresa que lo traslada

some time looking. i have to have an unlocked phone and since the quad version was only available in the international version, i gave it a try. it has definitely met my expectations and more. fast versatile and good looking. i had to get use to the size but that didn't take long. the only downside is the price. overall, i am very satisfied .   me gusto el tiempo y forma de entrega, cumple con las expectativas de comprar en linea, se entrego en domicilio bien embalado .   i have to pay $80 to unlock the phone. tengo que pagar $80 adicionales para liberar el telefono. â¿quien me los reembolsa luego .   i am not satisfied with samsung galaxy charger as it is not compatible to use in us. i need to buy an extra converter to make it work. why doesnt hassle provide with samsung galaxy phone which is compatible in us as i bought the phone is us and will use phone in us. international version doesnt mean that charger will be given for asian countries .   just received the phone today, took it to verizon to get the smaller sim card and was informed that this phone is not compatible with the verizon network. amazon customer service worked with on setting up returning the phone. kind of bummed, but off to the big blue box to pick up the phone .   muy buen producto cumpliã³ con todo lo esperado usã¡ndolo apenas llego a venezuela sin ningun problema lo recomienzo 100% vendedor muy cumplido. i like my new phone. everything was fine, but a acceptable dead pixel was on the screen. i got many apps. i love android .   o n l y p h o n e ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚e v e n n o d a t a l

exactamente lo que esperaba y el precio es razonable. hi, i bought this phone with no problem. i have used it for 3 months and then the phone's motherboard gone bad. i have contacted samsung but they did not help me at all. because of the phone being international version, that's what i think, they asked me to contact taiwan. can you believe it, i am buying the phone from us and they want me to contact taiwan when there is a problem. samsung did not take any responsibility of his product even it was under warranty. so i contacted amazon and they have somehow solved my problem. thanks to amazon. but be careful when buying international version phone .   i have to start saying that i am an android fan. before using this model i had a galaxy gio this particular model was everything i expected, the performance the upgrades, everything is a lot better than previous versions. i was afraid about the size, the last model i had was 4.1" so i though 4.8" was too much. the first time i made a call did feel weird, but with time i got used to it. it fits great in my pocket even using a protective case. the battery improvement is great. i use my phones a lot, so i had to charge my phone twice per day. but now, with the same use i charge my galaxy siii every day and a half. the instructions came in english and hebrew, and the main language for the phone was hebrew, but don't worry. the first time you start the phone you get to change the language in the first screen .   well really wanted this for my self but then my wife kept complaining that he phone was not keeping up with what she wanted to do. her birthday was right around the corner and i said you know what i think i found her gift shipped very quickly and she is still enjoying it very much. i am not allowed to touch her baby  .   ahhaha. great phone and so much more .   am loving learning all about how to use it. it is very easy to figure out and offers many helpful hints as you go along .   mobile phone with an excellent display, very fast, the truth is an excellent mobile device. despite the large, easily handled with one hand. the cpu is very good, but do not know why the machine can not get root privilege.it is not very large, is very suitable .   whenever i would have the requisite amount of money to purchase it, i wont delay a second to do it. i hope it happens soon .   muy bueno muy bueno muy bueno excelente lo recomiendo entrega rãpida y sin obstãculo los felicito por el producto y. i love this phone, better then my blackberry. is super nice, good size and al lot of app to used for free. excellent phone samsung brand. a team of high-level suarios demanding. i highly recommend it especially if you like the android operating system. received the item on time as promised on the 8th of feb. however due to personal tragedy in my family, i have still to connect and operate the smartphone samsung galaxy s iii/s3. i'll comment and review at a later date .  btw, i didn't receive three of the other items i ordered .   el producto me llegã“ en el tiempo establecido en la compra, todo bien y en perfecto estado por lo tanto recomiendo al vendedor como serio y responsable. i purchased my phone through "open group wireless" fulfilled by amazon. i have an amazon store card and with that comes interest free payments on certain monetary amounts. i believe (not looking) that for anything over $300.00, there is a one year interest free payment plan on that item, or that particular purchase. if you purchase other items post, that transaction, they will not be included in your previous interest free deal, so keep that in mind if you choose to use the store card and make sure to double check card conditions with amazon on purchases over a certain amount. on big ticket items, i only buy from a vendor that amazon backs, because returns are less of an issue and i believe the company is safer and more legitimate when fulfilled by amazon. i once bought a sheet set from a vendor not fulfilled through amazon and everything stated about sheets online was a lie. the actual packaging said "like- 800 count egyptian cotton" but the vendor neglected to put "like" in the description and when i wrote a "buyer beware" review, i received lots of nasty gram emails demanding that i remove my unflattering review. i believe someone even called me and was nasty to me. i now choose very carefully,who i do business with on amazon. they cannot police every company or individual who wants to sell, but the ones they do back, i have never had a problem with. i have read reviews about galaxy 3 phones (not backed by amazon) having been opened, seal broken, because seller stated they needed to put the unlock code on the phone. this is not true, if the phone is a legitimate international unlocked cell no one needs to "add the code", and avoid these sellers if you read anything about them needing to "add unlock code". i've purchased 3 unlocked samsungs and never has there been a seal broken. the phones are unlocked, brand new, never used, from factory and only reason someone would open phone to "add" unlock code, is because it is a used phone that is specific to a particular company. for example, if the phone was an att phone and you want to use tmobile, tmobile needs the att code in order to provide service to that phone. all of the non contracted start ups allow for customers to bring their own phones and in the instructions it states that the unlock code from the previous phone company is needed. that is why a seller is putting the unlock code on the phone. open group wireless has true, unlocked international, warrantied, phones and when you are paying more than $500.00 for a cell phone, that is exactly what you want. i read reviews about bad batteries, movie data already loaded on the phone (that means it was someone else's phone before you got it), batteries that were not even factory issue, bad chargers, inability to switch language, advertised as an international unlocked, but was not, and a plethora of other issues. if you receive the phone and seal is broken, taped over, don't do anything to it, except return it, because you will have an issue with that phone, it is not brand new, and it is not what it was advertised to be. if you go with the companies that amazon backs, you will be fine. i paid a little more for that security and i have no regrets. my phone arrived by the date it was promised, it was not opened, box was completely factory sealed and changing language from german to english was as easy as instructions stated. i have purchased unlocked international cell phones before, so i knew that they were adaptable to contract and non contracted services and i've used them on both plans. after researching and reading that others went the straight talk route with the galaxy 3, that was my plan. the cool thing about non contracted services is that you pay around $50.00 for a month of unlimited, everything service, and if one company does not serve well, pay another $50.00 to check out another company, until you find the one that provides best service to your area- it is still cheaper than being stuck in a contract. in the straight talk start up kit, there are 3 sim cards, a larger one, then att and tmobile . att (as i was told by rep), has a mini sim for the galaxy 3, but having already read that others trimmed the card down that came in the kit, i did same and have no problems. i put both att and tmobile sim cards in my phone and should have went with the tmobile because i get better service in my home, but when i was speaking with the rep, i could not get the sim card to stop popping out. she said it may need trimmed some more. she also said if i was able to get it to stay, all i needed to do was call them back, switch sim serial numbers and then go through the process of apns, in order to get data. here is where some aggravation may come in. there are not enough categories on the straight talk apn webpage for the galaxy 3 to get internet working, so i had to call for help, this could require patience. no matter what time of day i called, or that i tried again the following day, it took me half a day to finally be able to leave a call back. just about every time i called, the recording said, "there was an unusually large volume of calls" and they could not take mine, then click. when i did get through, the recording said call back was 30 minutes, it was nearly 2 hours, but when i finally got a warm body around 8:30 pm, she stayed on the phone with me until i had internet. it took some trial and error to finally get it. i complained to her, that the website was not well equipped and about the long time in which it took to speak with someone, and she apologized. she said that the company was aware and they were taking steps to improve customer service. the one thing i wish i had, that didn't come with phone, but which is downloadable, is a users guide. a quick start, manual was included in phone packaging, with details on how to access owners guide and i will take the time to do that, for i am not savvy in the smart phone world to know the full capabilities of this phone. the phone uses like a tablet, so i am familiar with how to obtain apps etc .   i love the large screen, the options, and the camera takes great pics. the one thing to remember is that if there are apps continuously running in the background, that will suck battery incredibly fast (learned that in one day). as for factory issued battery- i text for a couple of hours in the evenings, post pics, text off and on during the day, access internet, and check my email. at end of an average day i can be anywhere from 67%-40% available battery usage. i charge it every night. the better battery will be a future investment. the key to a happy phone experience, is to buy from the right vendor first and foremost. what i discovered about the reviews, is that they are all grouped together and it is difficult to know which vendor a review is about, unless author mentions it. one can click on vendor, be directed to their page and then see reviews specific to them. that can take a very long time. there are also vendors who operate under more than one company name. beware of these vendors. amazon is my favorite place to shop and i do a lot of business with them. i may not be a savvy smart phone user, but i am a savvy, well informed shopper and do not jump for the cheapest price on amazon. do the research, know what an unlocked international cell is supposed be before you buy. contact seller to see if they need to add an "unlock code" to the phone you are considering to purchase. i wrote a vendor to ask why they operated under more than one (at least 3) company name. no reply. it is as simple as this, international unlocked under warranty, does exist. i have one, love my galaxy 3, got exactly what i was told i was getting- a brand new, straight from the factory cell phone. i got it from open group wireless, fulfilled by amazon .   this is the best phone that has come to the world market to date. i think this is more than iphone in many ways. my brother has a iphone 4s and was watching everything the mine offers and decided to sell the iphone to buy a galaxy s3. at first i thought it was overkill when critics called it "the iphone killer" but i think they are right .   this phone was delivered on time by the supplier, so i could use it overseas. once i was overseas, the phone was easy to set up as it came already unlocked. i used it all the time and always performed as advertised, no problems whatsoever. i will highly recommend this phone, which i think it is better than the i-phone .   excelente el producto lo recomiendo, llego en buenas condiciones. el empaque es muy bueno, no estaba abierto y a tiempo .   its locked for at&t, it isnt i9300 is the usa version i747.  .   s s s s s s s. this phone is so cool! plus its unlocked so it will work on any network! but the only problem i have is that i cant silence the camera noise since in other countries besides 'murica its illegal or something to have a silent cell camera. privacy rights or something. youll have to get root access to silence the camera. event third party camera apps wont work to silence it .   first of all i would like to say nothing wrong with this item as a phone and i am giving it five star, also nothing wrong with amazon, the only issue is with an amazon seller which is (abe-123), i contacted that seller around the past three weeks without any respond although amazon is confirming every sent e-mail just few minutes after sending. i purchased this phone for $680.00 on july 2012 here at amazon and i understand that there is no warranty for this international version, but it i understand that it is covered by factory warranty. this phone stopped working and died on january 2013 after just five months without any mishandling or misuse, samsung usa turned me to samsung uk where international versions can be repaired, the guy in uk gave me the number that i shoul write on the package in order to be accepted by the repair center, but samsung uk refused to accept this phone for repair and they returned the phone back to me after paying another $100.00 for shipping by fedex. i came back to amazon trying to find a resolution to my issue, but amazon is terning me to that seller who is not responding at all, now i ended-up with a dead phone that costs me $680.00 for the phone + $100.00 paid to fedex. all what i was looking for is at least to hear from amazon if they can help in this case or not but i was not expect to take that silent situation. so i found my responsibility to give new customer my experience with purchasing an international versions, just be aware you may be in my shoes one day .   excellent treatment and responsible negotiation, are recommended to buy, thanks for the sale, i hope soon to have to buy back their products. samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone .   the best. killer smartphone. excellent product. arrived ok as expected.

expectativas .  el diseã‘o el menãš todo muy elegante y super rãpido fui cliente de bb por 5 aã‘os, valiã“ la pena el cambio. compre el telefono samsumg s3, desbloqueado y no esta desbloqueado y necesito el cã³digo de desbloqueo para poder usarlo aqui en venezuela con la telefonia movistar. i can't describe this cellphone, the brand talk by itself. samsumg has the best celphones around the world. on costa rica it works perfect .   brazil - gramado - rio grande do sul was this vendor, i never got the phone as well never answered e-mails, do not trust the vendor. me encanta el telefono, es lo maximo, recomiendo al vendedor llego a tiempo aqui a venezuela, es super util, tiene muy buenas funciones. i will not deny this is a great phone, looks good, works fast and everything is just stellar. but any of you fools that buy the international version like i did you will get a rude shock when you run into any issues with this devise. 1) samsung customer service usa will not be able to even trace your phone because the serial numbers are not synced to us numbers. 2) you have to know which country your phone originated from and talk to their customer service for help. i have no idea? i could all 27 eu countries and see who recognizes it. 3) even a minor problem, like what i called to seek help on .   i have all my volume and tones set up and tested .   however when someone calls me .   the phone never rings, it will beep when you hit the keys to type a text but it does not beep or vibrate to let you know if you received a text, so there is clearly a problem with the alert issue .   even the alarm will not ring when set. customer service usa will not help even with that let alone walk you through the motions. conclusion .   im sending this international version back .   buying the usa version and if ya'll are smart .   believe me now .   buy american! or you are doomed .   picture calling greece or poland every time something goes wrong is that even worth it? with the time zones and all .   i made a huge mistake .   i got this phone yesterday and its on its way back today! lesson learned .   buy the american version if you live in the usa .   i have nothing to complain about this phone. i am very satisfied. it is better than i was expecting. great phone .   i purchased this item as a gift for my niece and she was totally blown away by it. she really loves it .   i bought the samsung with hasslefreecell - and i was first not amused because i had to puy customs taxes for france. i told them i now they gave me a part back. so i think that's a nice gesture, because it's something the french government does :(:(:(. it is great and my only concern is the battery consumption: if you get addicted to using it, you'll drain the batteries too soon. me encanta mi celular, al vendedor lo recomiendo 100%, tuve la entrega antes de tiempo .   no me quejo de absolutamente nada .   perfect couldn't ask for better. the service was excellent and the product is more than i expected. glad i purchased it .   i bought this phone as an upgrade from my samsung galaxy note phone. i had it since july 2012 and a few months ago i started to see on my top right hand corner of teh screen a purple hue. i havent dropped the phone. it's been expanding slowly to the rest of the screen. the screen works and i am able to use my phone but i wished there was better quality. samsung phones are great, would change them but i feel thet could be made with better quality materials. i would recomend the phone but be careful with it, its extremely delicate .   great phone and computing system i like it and definitely will use it for my primary phone and recommend it to relatives. i'am very happy with s3 - i9300.but, you this phone has a problem. the problem is to send a text message received when the other party is messy code(the send message is chinese).i hope you can give me to find a way to solve the problem .   i am very happy with the purchase very good recommend the product and a good price. i hope to buy again thanks. it is all in the description, and i bought it knowing that this version is non lte and, despite it is quad core, it is slower than us versions due to only 1 gb of ram comprared with 2 in the us version. my wofe has the htc one x and, apart from the screen, it is much better, faster and stable phone than the s3 i9300 .   i really love it. i think this is the best smart phone in the market right now. it has already updated to jeally bean .   excelente entrega a tiempo mercancã­a en buen estado era lo q yo esperaba y mã¡s tal cual ofrece en la publicaciã³n lo recomiendo totalmente. i got the phone with the ice cream sandwich os and i felt it was lacking something although it was pretty smooth and had good features. however when i got it updated to jelly bean os it came with a lot more features and capabilities that i found to be really impressive. i will choose this over the iphone 5 any day. cudos to samsung for such a great phone .   samsung galaxy s3 is powered phone quality. collect all my needs. and is modern and beautiful, i love this phone .   was i fell from a height of 10 centimeters and is broke the screen, i do not recommend for anything this phone is broken very easily, i have a htc that is me has fallen many times, that if it is a truth phone .   iu own other android, a this is the one to beat in the price level! fast, clear and effective. only down, the skinni plastic plate. the phone is amazing easy to use, great unique features that makes it the best smart phone so far, really fast the voice command works fine to change songs, stop or repeat alarms. the cam really stands up many features and really fast .   it can be an international version, but the wall charger is a simple uk one. wont fit any where else in the world .   excelente celular, llego en el tiempo estimado, sin problema ninguno, tiene buen funcionamiento, vendedor muy bueno y responsable .   recomendado 100%. very good! works excellent no problems / todo excelente traã­do a venezuela, funciona perfectamente, liberado, la entrega se hizo a tiempo .   lo recomiendo ampliamente todo perfecto gracias. el equipo esta en excelente condiciones y el vendedor envio rapido la mercancia al casillero de nuevo gracias. most awesome phone i've ever had. fast, reliable, sturdy,, it's upgradable to jelly bean, nice hardware, beautiful, powerful. love it .   i just dont like the fact that it had german configuration, european electric adaptor and i bought it in usa. i like this phone so much that i bought another and sent it to my father overseas .   i like the quality of camera in it and the size of screen .   the item came as described within the range of days it was supposed to come and it was well packed .   buy this mobile exactly 5 months and a day like any other stopped working. bring it to a repair center and was told that the main board was burned. research on the internet and it turns out that the galaxy s3 have a hardware defect, at 5 months were burning main board. i tell them not to buy this mobile, because it has no warranty, and lose their money, as i now have to buy another, and pay only 5 months ago more than 500usd laying burn that has no warranty. if i had, samsung knows the problem and they changed to a new one, but since it does not, just lost my money. thanks to this sale. not lose their money, do not buy this mobile .   it says in the paper which comes with the phone box, you can not use this phone with verizon or sprint, i thought it was okey. you can use att or t mobile, however you can not use 3g or 4g internet you can only use edge internet, so , what is the benefit of this phone. it is useless, i bought it and i returned it without opening the box. i researched before i bought. i have nothing negative other than i keep playing with it like a new toy received at christmas, and christmas is long gone. i am coming from a bb, so there is more screen, more power, more apps, and just a lot more fun. i dont know all that it can do yet but i love finding out new things on a daily basis .   i love this phone <3 excelente telã©fono, llegã³ a mis manos en venezuela, en perfecto estado y todo en orden. me encanta la pantalla tã¡ctil del equipo, la cã¡mara es lo mã¡ximo, y todas sus funciones son excepcionales .   este celular ha sido de las mejores elecciones que he hecho, los colores se ven super nã­tidos, es liviano y super rã¡pido, fotos, videos, cualquier cosa que hagas con el se convierte en algo espectacular. i am very happy with this phone, it works wonderful! the color is nice and the technology nr. 1! a very good purchase .   what a great phone .   i`t was perfectly unlocked. i brought it to my country a worked just fine. i recommend it .   samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300is a excellent mobile phone. great acquisition. have all tools are necessary to be online with technology world. i am loving every day of having this phone. beautiful, stylish and extremely useful .   highly recommend to every one  .   product arrived in tact w/o any issues. although i am yet to activate it, it arrived according to the schedule and without any problems. well packaged .   generally, the phone i received meet my expectations - factory unlocked, new, working properly. however, since it's the international version, the phone plug is not the us one. the plug is not flat but round. i need to buy a convertible plug. and it's irritating me .   at the moment, i feel this is the best droid phone right now on the market. its fast, it has good features, and not to mention the thin size and light weight .   i have had a s iii before and i know that with all cellphones, once you get it you must let the battery run down completely before charging it. i did that and once it was fully charged, i unplugged it. 5 hours later the battery is at 10 % and the pop up messgae is on the screen asking for the charger to be plugged in. i will take a closer look at the battery life again and re submit my findings. fast, slim, light, beautiful, easy to use. this device is great! it took me several months to decide wich phone to buy. after so much comparison and investigation i definitly got the best .   es el mejor telefono que he comprado, y eso que soy muy quisquilloso con lo que quiero. lo recomiendo ampliamente. i bought this phone a few weeks ago. it came in perfect condition, everything works wonderfully and i jus love it! there are so many things you can do with i. i would definitely recommend this phone to anyone .   without words, is fast, lightweight, functional, delicate, beautiful, charming me is super convenient, battery lasts me almost two days if not connected to wifi all day or playing, but it's amazing i can charm me have my games my studies my work check social networks and chat with my friends all at once i recommend 100%. battery life much lower than advertised. also, i had ordered two of these, and one fell on the ground and the screen cracked - is this covered by warranty .   the galaxy s3 is an unlocked phone, the box, cell and manuals were neat and in very good conditions. i guess originally for the french and italian market .   this is a very fast phone, a tthink this is its most relevant fature .   the size is not what like the most, a mean, it isn't discret at all .   but am happy wiht it. if you don't matter about a phone size i'll plany recomend this one for you .   after i used for a couple of month, the screen turned black never turned back on .   i have it in a protective case and took good care of it .   bad product and seller! dont buy. this is my second galaxy 3, i liked it so much that i bought this cellular one extra for the birthday of my dad, he is not familiar with new technologies but is very happy with this phone .   these telephone is the best phone i have used. it is has almost replaced my ipad. the only problem i had was with the volume button, didnt work well, but it was fixed for usd 20 .   very good phone , only disappointment was not getting guide and phone in english version , i need to customer service to contact to setup in english and download guide .   i love this phone the only thing that i hate its that i didnt know about the differences on ram between the international version and companies version. this cell phone works perfectly and is unlocked and international version, in perfect conditions and do not have problem in this package. me encanta este producto por sus aplicaciones y por ser uno de los equipos mã¡s actualizados en el mercado celular. this is my first android phone, so i wanted to have a quality phone, i have to say that so far i am very happy with my purchase. i'm not really a "gadget and widget" kind of person so a lot of the technical specs are lost on me, but the ease of use and simplicity of the phone has won me over .   my only criticisms is that the absolute basics are not made obvious, eg: i could not find any info on how to answer the phone , i looked online and on youtube and looked through the basic manuals that came with the phone, i felt quite silly to not know how to do such a basic thing. fortunatey my nephew came to the rescue, and of course once you know  .  it's so simple. i am a person who is vision impaired so being able to change the text size is convenient and helpful, i tried the speaking feature that comes for people with vision issues, but i found it to be too intrusive, even obnoxious, and was the cause of our first and only fight(sammy and me-sammy is my phones name, obviously!)oh yeah .  you can give your phone a name, and wake it up with a "good morning" .  ah the magic .   overall, i can only say again that i am very happy with my phone and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new experience, even my 80yr old mother has used it and she is a "technophobe" .   this phone is great, but i have a complain .   i live in south america where this pone works excellent. but i usually go to usa for bussines and this phone is banned on tmobile so i cant use with my line. very dissapointed with that .   i bought this phone and still used, befor the sell shiped to me i contacted him this is unlocked and international version gt9300, he response me yes, when i got the phone it was t999 t-mobile not gt9300 but any way it well after month i received update notice form t-mobile when i updated, then i can not use personel hot spot which is important when i had tirp to my home country it was not working with gsm network, it is really upset me .   from the moment you first turned on, it is easy to use, with advanced technology, just as good as the competition. you will be in another dimension. must take into account the first time you turn on the phone to set the language correctly. this phone goes beyond what i expected recommended 200%. the galaxy s3 is a really good phone; it's really fast for the most part and the battery lasts just enough for a workday. there are some occasional hick ups on the speed and the battery may die sooner - but that's mostly dependent on data usage .   esta super lindo, muy practico y me encanta .   no me ha dado problemas en lo absoluto y se los recomiendo .   came smoothly everything ahead of schedule. i recommend it 100%. all without any problems . . . . . .  .   i'm completely in love with my cute samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone. it's awesome .   very light and incredibly beautiful! it's working perfectly in brazil .   very good product is fast, betifull, and utility is very fun and practic, i recomended this product, good product, exelent resulution. nice phone with a lot of features that fit my needs for entertainment and for business. i just miss a mx office application. probably not a bad phone, but due to radio frequency issues with t-mobile in southern california, data is limited to 2g "edge" data rates which is unusably slow for this sort of device. so beware .   great customer service. ill buy from this company, good phone and a very good price. this phone was an xmas gift for my daughter and she loved it .   superb equipment. don't waste your money buying unexplainable expensive brands . this device can provide all you expect from a smartphone and much more .   my sgs3 was very good, but all of sudden i got the sudden death syndrome, i'm having problems with the warranty, since i live in mexico and samsung wont help because i don't have a receipt with the imei on it. dont buy this product because the warranty dont works. buen telefono, buen procesador. calidad de graficos. gran capacidad de memoria y es muy bonito. lo recomiendo a todos. gran compra .   this phone is amazing! i had an iphone before but this phone has blown me away! i love it, it's easy to use (not as intuitive as the iphone), better resolution, better camera, great performance, just awesome! i love it and would not like to change it anytime soon .   sometimes contacts window is slow but it wont make me stop liking this smartphone. i just love it. samsung thanks for that .   it has all feature which i wanted. its very fast as well .   but due to multi tasking feature it doesnt kill the processes which eventually consumes lot of ram. it would be better to have auto task killing process after some limit .   bought it for my dad and he is enjoying using it. good phone with many useful features and apps. will recommend it .   nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop, nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop, nice, excellent product, i'm very happy whit this shop. it does everything the iphone does, but in a bigger package. i also enjoy the option the swap batteries when the primary gets low and bring over my entire music collection on my sd card. the camera is not as good as the iphone image wise, but makes up for it with its features. the motion motion commands really are handy too. like the flip over to mute calls and music, tap to go to the top of the list, and direct to call. don't worry about what others say about the cheap plastic. most of us put our phones in a hard case like ottorbox anyway. you or no one else will see that plastic .   muito legal .   funcionou bem no brasil .   valeu muito a pena .   bom vendedor, chegou bem no local que eu solicitei e bom preã§o. i was looking for a s3 to use with at&t and this phone worked great. i just cut my regular sized sim card down to size utilizing a video i watched on youtube, popped in the modified sim card and it worked great! love the phone. the only thing that was unexpected was the non-us ac wall adapter plug but they included a us to non-us adapter for it so i was able to use it, still. no issues. very satisfied customer .   its hardware specs are over kill. quad core processor! and yes, everything moves smoothly and quickly on this phone. there may have a few delays here and there, but that's expected. this phone requires both hands, although you can use it a bit with one hand .   i have nothing to say but this phone is really awesome .   so buy'em before they sell out. buy'em! it's fast and better than my samsung galaxy note. i should buy a note 2 since i love big phones. this phone is beats iphone 5 and nokia 920 .   this phone is excellent for android lovers, with a big beautiful screen (yes, it's pen tile, but in my daily use it has never bothered me). the quad-core processor is fast and responsive, and the micro-sd card expansion is a welcome addition, in these times when sd card slots seem to be on the verge of extinction. the jelly bean update is available, making it even better .   purchased it unlocked for use in china. i have very few complaints with it. it is a really excellent mobile device .   me encanto el equipo, es super interactivo, util, practico y facil de manejar. me encanta mi telefono nuevo y el color maravilloso. inside the package was not celular commercial invoice, send a picture of it to: inmortaly1990@hotmail.com requires the purchase invoice to process the shipment please post the purchase invoice. just love it. still going through the process of learning how to appreciate all the features it has come with. one complain i have. the quick guide booklet suggested to go on the samsung website and download the user manual. i tred that several times and have not been able to do so. the site directs you to everything else including washing machines, vehicles etc. and no manual. that i found to be very disappointing, as i was hoping to obtain as much info as possible relating to the use of the phone .   1) cannot take the full advantage of the phone because it does not work with us carriers. 2) the s talk feature is not as good as apple counterpart .   the phone was delivered within the required time and in perfect condition. living in europe, it was important for it to be unlocked and i have had absolutely no issues using it. getting to grips with the phone is super easy - very instinctive. love it .   very good experience, i recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time. the product was exactly the that i wanted. i ordered this samsung galaxy s iii gt-19300 unlocked brand new as the ad stated on the website urgently so i can use it when traveling overseas. unfortunately, instead i received the item in an open box broken seal which assumed to be used. the item has some minor problems such intermittent flickering and i have to tap hard on the screen to execute programs which i can live with since i have to leave out of country and don't have time to send it back and get another one. the problem was reported immediately after i received unit, but the seller never replied back. the shipping was good and delivered on time .   i bought this phone as a factory unlocked one. i received a t-mobile version which was unlocked but not the international version. the international version is much better that the us version. it so much faster when you stream on youtube, and the screen is resolution is so much better. the international version is supported by a quad-core processor, not dual core as the us version. don't be fooled by the fact that the us version comes with 2 gigs of ram, because the quad-core processor of the international version still makes the performance much better even with one gig of ram. i hate amazon because i was fooled by one of its garbage sellers .   5 stars to this phone. all the features of the phone works perfectly. recommended already to a lot of people .   got my s111 in no time at all & just as described but even better .   it has so many options it will always have something new for me to learn. not difficult to operate just sooooo much in such a small sleek gadget!ha!i will never want or ever need anything else in a cellphone.the galaxy has it all .  terrie. buyers beware the phone is not supported by samsung us. my just phone died after 5 months of use and now i have spent almost 5 hours of chatting and calling different folks from samsung and no one would take responsibly. the seller should have mentioned this while selling the product .   perfect, white, 32gb internal, and the most importan totally unlocked. i just opened, connect my micro chip and begun to udes it! delivery time was amazing (less than i expected); i received all accesories and i registred the phone in samsung web so it is original .   item was received on timely basis. exactly as noted. excellent product , that i would hughly recommend to anyone , as well as the overall experoence w/ the order. se reinicia solo el telefono y no lo cubre la garantia de este comercio. . . . .  .   . . . . . . . .  .   amazed! this is a great phone/tablet/computer/etc, etc, etc .   i just loved it! the phone itself just like many other gadgets, need some improvements, the screen may be hard to see during the daylight and if you let it to get adjusted automatically the battery will go down faster. but after all it is a great device .   fast, nice screen and the battery does last. using cm 10.1 right now and i cant complain. try to avoid generic usb cables to charge it, i noticed that in some cases it "charges" but is minimal and at the end i was still losing battery while charging under generic cables .   before getting this phone, i have been an iphone user since it was launched. i liked the ease of using the iphone but didn't like the fact that i didn't have flexibility in terms of adding memory or replacing battery. i didn't want to pay 100$ for 16gb of memory when i can get it for $20. also, the only problem i had with my iphone was deteriorating battery life but there was no way of changing it expect paying the high charges. the intent of review is not to bash apple but as i have been an user i will compare the 2 phones. i have used the iphone 4s, so can make a more recent comparison. - ease of use i think apple is still ahead in the area but not by much, there is a bit of learning curve with android and it took me a couple of days to get used to it. having said that, my 1 year old can unlock iphone but can't do the same with galaxy. also, answering the phone is more intuitive on iphone. however, one of the best features of galaxy is the drop down notification bar. i love that i can switch to the airplane mode or disable wifi w/o pressing 4 buttons. also, iphone fits better in smaller hands but for me galaxy is not a problem. - typing if you have a smartphone, you will type and for me samsung wins. the best feature is that it doesn't force auto-complete down your throat. it gives you word choices including what you are tying. i am bi-lingual and this is a great feature when i am using my mother tongue. also, in the swype mode galaxy does a pretty good job of providing context based suggestions. - display and sound i don't care for retina display, galaxy is the winner for me. same for sound - battery life this is a tie. my wife's iphone lasts longer even though she is a more heavy user but i can change mine :) - memory: samsung (read intro) - apps this is a tie for me. i get most apps on both platforms and to be honest i am not a very app intensive person. i have about 25 apps in all - software itunes wins, this isn't even a contest. kies is pretty hopeless - photos: iphone does a better job with stills and galaxy does a better job with movies. galaxy really suffers when taking shots in the dark. the flash makes the pictures look a little weird color wise. - call quality galaxy is clearer for me overall, i am having been using google products for many years now and for me android integration with google is a big plus .   no complains about it, it delivered and works perfectly without any flaws, just as advertised. highly recommend, and you should get this phone. this phone is a master piece compare to all the phone i used. it is user's friendly and easy to use. i am proud to recommend this phone to anyone - it is perfect in every ways .   beware of buying this product, it's very likely to suffer the sudden death syndrome (google about it), and no warranty is honored neither by the store nor samsung for the international version. i've been a samsung fan for a long time, but this has been a huge disappointment, so no more samsung products for me. their warranty model is just a joke .   i brought this cell phone for myself and i love it. everything i need in the palm of my hands .   this phone is great! lots of features and apps. it came on time, unlocked and ready to use here in mexico. i took the sim card from my iphone 4s and inserted it along with a 64 gb sd card and turned on the phone and it has worked flawlessly on the telcel network. amazon did a great job. the only phone for me .   i love this phone. bit of a learning curve with all the features on the phone. i honestly haven't found anything to be disappointed with yet .   my olnly compliant is about the battery, it doesn't last long, the phone works very good and is impressive at all .   i had a blackberry 9790, and i bought two week ago this samsung, it's amazing, i think it has a big screen, works very well, my battery works excelente, it's amazing smartphone, it interface its lighter for use .   my new toy for christmas .   i found this device in amazon market place and i loved it at first. and price was awesome .   i expect enjoy it for long time. the phone i purchased works perfectly with the carrier i intended to use it on. (straight-talk) .   the company sent me the sim card, it took a few seconds to install .   contacted straight-talk with the required info .   within an hour, phone and data were in full operation. now i have a top of the line phone with an unlimited phone/data plan at only $46.00 a month .   ( half the price of other carriers. ). equipo muy moderno con muchas aplicaciones diseã±o elegante colores modernos cumple 100 % mis necesidades, lo unico malo es la poca duracion de la bateria. equipo muy moderno con muchas aplicaciones diseã±o elegante colores modernos cumple 100 % mis necesidades, lo unico malo es la poca duracion de la bateria. the good is not working properly, as an example, when i tap de screen as to open an item for my mail, picture, file, etc. it doesn't work, i have to tap several times or back in the screen then return to the item to open it. i am considering returning the product based on warranties .   the best mobile in market now. it is very light for its dimensions. the camera is good. the music quality is also good .   the spcet of the product its not fair. i suppose it was a 4 g device, i didn't find the the right spec when i bought, but when came the valuation from amazon, about the purchase it was absolutily clear. why it was not clear before .   we have had this phone now for almost 3 years and it still running. it has been thrown, dropped in the rain, used at the gym, flooded with sugar drinks in a purse. exposed to ridiculous humidity for the last couple years and so far its only had to be dried out a couple of nights. damn fine product .   amazing phone.i fully recommend this product, totally worth every dollar spent on it. i love it. high performance, lots of apps .   i think it's a good quality product. i have a bb phone but i can not even use it. i will be able to evaluate both products and see if this exceeds the phone galaxy 3 bb. actually i'm looking for a phone that allows me to use the internet to my phone company and allow me to make calls to different galaxy 3 software that can provide me. i think it was a good buy. i recommend it .   well, almost. just for the charger. it comes with a weird german (?) wall plug. since the plug is changeable, just hoped to be warned and have the option to buy the correct one, instead of that huge adapter. besides that, great product and arrived as expected .   i love this phone. after 6 months of ownership, i got in love with this phone. it's always fast and responsive. the display is amazing, really good colors, brightness and resolution. both back and front cameras are amazing. it takes really good pictures, and panoramic pictures are amazing. android os gets updated frequently (not as frequently as for google phones). im actually at android 4.1.1 and it's full of features. excelente equipo estoy satisfecho, es la version internacional, y cumple con todas las expectativas, el costo inconparable para venezuela lo recomiendo. it was everything it said it was going to be and more, it's incredibly awesome and beautiful. best cell phone i have ever purchased, would recommend this to my friends anytime .   yo tengo un note 2 y este es mas comodo de llevar las funciones son las mismas practicamente son iguales claro este lo usa mi esposa yo me quedo con el note 2 jajajaja .   anda bien, ya he comprado esa marca y funciona bien .  estoy conforme con la compra y la forma de envio, gracias .   this phone is awesome, and works perfectly .   i really love samsung, they made incredible stuff and of a very high quality .   the delivery was as expected and the product as advertised. it's an execellent phone. the best i've ever had. the android system is superb: great apps, notification system, integration. the phone is fast, great camera and screen (size and picture quality) i love it .   almost flawless in that it has only german text assistance available. love the fm radio feature. switching between a wi-fi and network connection to the same web station can be glitchy .   the phone itself is good and i really love it, and it is unlocked (it works fine in different countries), but every time it reboots, it starts with the t-mobile screen and then loads the android. also, mine was a german version and when i first started it everything was in german, i changed the language but as it came out, not all the things are translated. for example s-voice is in german. the company who is selling the phones is cheating, they sell some unlocked phones as an international version, don't buy from them! other than that, the phone is great .   this is the best phone nowadays .   i just love it .   it is a fantastic electronic device .   wonderful item .   thank you. the phone is good so far, my only problem is the sim slot is too small. currently i'm using it to surf the net through wi-fi. it's a cool phone. this is the best cell phone i have ever seen. it works so fast.i think it is better iphone. love samsungï¼. i like this better than the earlier iphone 4s we have. it does consume power, but if turn off wifi and bluetooth, when i dont need it, it lasts for more time. i love the all the device integration features to connect to other blue tooth or wifi enabled devices. although the connection to my car's bluetooth keep failing every now and then and i have to keep removing and adding the phone back to make it work. i wonder a software update will fix it. pictures and movies look good. although i will still stick to my dslr for serious pictures. the integration to gmail, gtasks makes my life more organized. all in all, i am enjoying this phone  .   funciona perfecto, cunple con todas las especificaciones, se actualizã³ a jb enseguida sin problemas. y funciona perfecto con prestadores de argentina. no me arrepiento para nada y lo volverã­a a elegir .   just perfect .   thanks, it was just like it said in the offer. very professional and fast. best regards. germã¡n sims sã¨ve .   una obra de arte, lo amaran. el iphone es juguete al lado de esta maquina. a masterpiece, you will love it. the iphone is a toy beside this machine .   the best phone i ever have .   ive been an iphone fan since it came out .   not anymore .   this is much better .   many more posibilities, programs, adds on .   gadgets .   everything .   i love the phone it is very useful very modern phone, it is controlling the market i already recommended to my friends. excelente los telefonos y vendedores .   compre dos y los enviaron super rapido y en tiempo record .   en venezuela con movistar que es con quien tengo la linea funcionan super bien .   es un telefono muy rapido .   lo mejor que ha salido. llego en perfectas condiciones completamente nuevo con todos sus accesorios, recomendado lo despacharon al dia siguiente de la compra, todo perfecto .   my five stars is because this product really was beyond my expectations. positives: pretty design, great screen quality, apps very functional. negatives: i couldn't find yet. people complain about the size, but you know that you are buying it. at least i can read well some files .   amazing item ad and excellent gift to give to any body and looks very fine article to buy any time, and excellent gadget. i was really worried about buying this phone because of the reviews, but so far it's been wonderful! i even bought another one for a gift. so i totally recommend it, its a great phone. battery life is the only thing that deserves improvement. overall, it is na amazing device and i am very satisfied .   best phone of this year. normal price but design and features are awesome. better than buying a diamond ring. samsung has won 2012 .   there was some confusion because the description describes the north american s3. i ordered from global mobiles and received a s3 gt-i9300 unlocked from t-mobile from germany (or other german speaking country). the phone works great. just recently upgraded to jelly bean via kies update (no flashing or installing custom os required). awesome phone .   i love it, it's the best phone in the market, it has thousands of apps att the androide market, the price worth it. una mounstruo de equipo nuevo desbloqueado recomendado es mas que un telefono sirve para todo lo mejor que he visto. i had a problem with the phone yesterday. i plug it to charge the battery, since it was around 5%. an hour later i checked it out and it was completely dead, and the bottom of the phone was extremely hot. i have tried everything on it, connect to the computer, connect to other electricity outlets at home, in my work, took out the battery and let it cool down, hard reset, etc .   nothing happens. it just died. nothing on the screen, no led indicator. i will take it to technical service today, but so far i have read in the internet that this is not an isolated case .   seems that there are a lot of cases identical to mine, and apparently it's a factory defect, which will probably cost a couple hundreds of usd (because the lack of a warranty to cover this issues). i would never buy a samsung again .   i am really sorry that my sim card did not fit the slot. my sim card is large and the siii slot is for a small size sim card. also, the package only includes a uk adaptor, no other adapters, like for u. s. or europe. i emailed the seller and requested a replacement siii that would fit my sim card. they replied for me to call for tech. service to fix my problem. i hope that i can have a smaller sim card made to fit the slot by my cell phone service provider. the siii does appear to be a great phone. i hope that i can get the sim card problem resolved .   hi, i've been using this phone more than 3 months, and it performs well. unfortunately, i dropped it on the floor few days ago, and cannot make it work anymore. i don't know where i can fix it. i lived in south california. do you know where is the official repair store here? i've tried very hard for finding any resources online, and still cannot find it. thanks .   i love it! i am not a big fan of apple because of the way they lock their software and in all honestly i hate itunes .   i got used to android and absolutely loved this phone! great functionality, awesome screen and it just does a lot. i recently changed it for an iphone 5 because i got the iphone from work, but i do miss my galaxy 3. siri is better on the iphone, i'll give apple that, but on the rest, i'll stick to the galaxy, for sure .   hello, i purchased a supposedly unlocked samsung galaxy 3 and now have found out that it can not be used due to the new at&t & t-mobile rules. please email me to resolve this issue .   i choose good, because now i have a trouble with usb connect and charge of the battery, i think i have to buy a new battery and a new usb connector .   in the title of the publication they said this was a i9300 samsung galaxy siii, but they sent me a sgh-t999 sgs3 in a fake box without the headphones. is not the same phone, not the same processor. the phone is really good, but even so i'm disapointed .   item was new in unopent box. camear super .   full new,with accesories. working great, speed super. good price for this features .   recommend. excelente mã³vil. muy buena resoluciã³n y fluidez. la cã¡mara es excelente y al actualizar a jelly bean mejora mucho mã¡s. great phone, i got it to my brother and he just loved it the phone arrived fast and i loved the service. this brand outdoes himself again, this phone will not let me down so far, excellent, fast and versatile, good screen size and excellent  .   it was a present for my wife and she is so delightfull with the phone. every fuctions she loves this phone .   it was a att phone. hat the at&t logo on the back cover. if i had known i would have gone to the att store .   i bought it for a friend. this is her first smartphone and she was able to use all the common features without asking. the interface is very natural. great phone .   the best phone ever. is just a great phone easy to use and has everything you need in a smartphone. it is a good product meets specifications, is good quality and best price is even worth it. since i use has not presented any problems. recommended 100% .   love the screen, size, weight of this phone. i strongly recommend it though i still have to make use of the nfc feature .   tris is the best phone in this moment, have all function andas more, i recommended totally i hope continue perfect. pros: awesome features quad core large battery con: worst design cool phone but a bit ovrpriced .  but far better than its competitors .   this item doesn't have any kind of warranty. i bought it just 4 months ago and it just died for no apparent reason. i contacted the seller an sai it didn't have warranty, i filed a claim with amazon just to receive that it has been over 30 days of purchase so it doesn't apply. i contacted samsung usa, samsung uk and samsung mexico just to be said that the item was bought in the us so it isn't covered by uk or mexico and samsung us said that as it was an international version not sold in the us it wasn't supported either! i just lost my $700 usd i spent in this item .   do not buy .   samsung galaxy s3 has been having lots of hardware problems, to fix mine will cost $500 usd to replace the motherboard not worth it .   warning .   love the phone. wasn't too happy that the seal was broken or that the box was left outside my house .   amazing phone, easy to use. the graphics are great. it feel good in the pocket though it seems quite big. the best thing is the camera .   needless to say the gift was a success. my husband loved it and i feel happy every time i see him play with it. it is not my cup of tea but my hubby likes to experiment and such so he will work with it .   i bought this phone and paid for one day shipping. took a week to show up. took this phone to my wireless provider and was told it was not supported by their system and was told only att was compatible. went home and started searching on the net and most reviews i found said it was not very compatible with att so returned phone. big screen, smart, and had a lot of free good apps. like another smartphones the batery go end very fast if you turn on gps, internet wi fi etc .   it's probably not samsung's fault, but the same version (s3 for 4g lte verizon) on vzw doesn't crashed all the time .   i bought this phone for a friend, and he really like the phone, but he has had issues with the camera. a complete reset has been necessary to bring back the camera working again. which is annoying because he has to download the apps and put the contacts back. love the phone, it's fast and the screen is very clear. the size is excellent and not heavy. still trying out different things on it .   the phone delivered ahead of schedule by my vendor. now on the product itself: unlocked samsung galaxy s3. this is an european version and require correct adopter to recharge. fortunately for me, i have an universal mobile charger that works on this phone as well. what i like about this phone: fast, efficient speed processor. smooth and easy navigation. the design is light and thin. my hands are quite small and was reluctant of holding this size screen size phone when i got it a month ago. now, i became comfortable holding the galaxy s3. i also liked the battery life-it last quite long. i am a t mobile customer and still have 12 months left to fulfill my 2 year contract obligation. i also found out through t mobile technical support that my data will be around 2g~3g speed but that didn't stop me from purchasing the unlocked samsung galaxy s3: i just didn't want to tie to a contract and i will stay with t mobile after my contract is fulfilled. for what i do, the data speed was not that bad and i use primarily in wifi environment. what i don't like and would like to improve: the screen is quite dim-the iphones screen display is better in my opinion and that is why i gave 4 star out of 5 .   got this thing from hassle free cell. it arrived on time. its a class apart piece of engineering. everything is excellent only the battery life is a problem but thats the case with most of the cellphones. the only problem i had was that i got the instruction guide with the product in french. apart from that its awesome .   nice piece of tech, powerful, nice camera and nice screen but just like some people say it feels kinda plastic but with a nice cover it doesn't really bother me .   the phone came in good conditions and like discribed on the page. it was delivered on time, but because the hollidays i receveid when i was leaving the hotel .   really a awesome phone. i'm in love with it. lot of functions are there, although much of those are not used in daily basis .   just buy the product if you really want to loose your money. the phone its a good camera. a lot of bugs .   i got my phone right before i was about to travel. it worked overseas like a charm. i recommend this phone to anyone that loves to make their life easier .   chegou no prazo e super bem embalado. o telefone ã© maravilhoso, superou minhas expectativas. vem com fones, carregador manual. recomendo o aparelho e o vendedor .   i wanted to buy an iphone but i changed my mind and bought this one. i am happy i did. so faster and confortable i bought it and in two weeks i recived it, work vert good and so easy to use. the phone is very good. fast, and everything worked as advertised. the only problem is it only worked for 4 months. went dead for no apparent reason, and there is no procedure do bring it back (doesn't even go into download mode). neither samsung brazil nor usa will honor the warranty, so i am left with an expensive paper weight. think twice before shelling that much money into a phone with no warranty .   the product arrived in ex celent conditions, with all accesories, the phone is in perfect con di tions , and on time. quad core is better than dual core .   you do the math .   pros. excellent screen, very resistent. perfect screen size flash support customizable cons. svoice doesn't works in spanish is not ergonomic. a worth for the money, i have already placed an order for the s3 mini for my wife. i love it .   strongly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new, cutting-edge device. its systems and apps work very well, the device is light (especially considering its size) and resistant, in spite of its frail, cheap appearence. samsung should definitely have invested a bit more for the casing. the battery life is a plus .   i bought this for my brother and he called this phone as the son of my galaxy note 2  .   they have almost the same function except for the s pen that my note have .  he gave his iphone 4s to his nephew who is in collage  .   when my bro came to my house he always talk about with this phone on how it amazes him every day .   now this is called a smart phone. it is a smart companion, rather than being just a phone! it can sense when to lock itself, all the motion sensors & smart tasks. oh. i love this .   like: it has an awesome screen, lots of apps, widgets. dislike: i was an iphone user for a few years and i miss how easy it was to have everything in sync with my mac and ipad. however, there are tons of apps out there that make the trick. this smartphone is great for anyone who is willing to invest a few hours configuring it. once you do that is perfect .   fully two years after it was launched, and i am still using it because the competition was only able to match some of its features but not all, not really. if you are in the market for a smart phone, this should not be perceived as an old technology, it is not, it still is competing with only one or two devices that have just come out on the market. galaxy s iii rules .   el telefono llego en excelentes condiciones y em el tiempo esperado .   muy buen servicio .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .   got this for my brother, and he love it. phone work fine and nothing bad to it. not like the other one i buy it. this if phone is great, awsome, thebest. love it, it has a big screen i can change the font to help with reading fine print its fast and feels good in my hand slim but something to grab on to the only negative is its not just plug in and download photos you have to download a program or use a chip to move photos its not complicated but i prefer just plug and go like

"this if phone is great, awsome, thebest , switching from an iphone 4s to this phone is simply the best . has worked flawless, i am using the the two s3 phones with straight talk here in el paso texas and it works great, i get average speeds of 7mbps, pretty much i dont miss using lte speeds, 7mbps is good enough for my needs. this beats the iphone5 my friend has. a lot of features, big screen,. i am agree with this purchase, the item came in perfect conditions, at time, the specifications are according with the product in the page. got my first android phone the galaxy s3. they were some customers complaining of receiving the american version which have the dual core processor instead of the quad core one, but i got the correct one. by the time i had gotten the phone the update for jelly bean was ready to be download and install, since it came with icecream sandwich. over all i like the phone the only concern is battery life and i have taken some steps to try and fix that .   after i got it i was super excited to use it, but first off i had verizon and no mini simcard to insert from my old smart phone. but at&t and t-mobile would be ideal for the phone if you bring it to your carrier's store .   this phone is amazing, it really makes all other phones look obsolete! i've had it for 3 weeks and now all other phones (including, and especially iphones) look ridiculous! the screen size and resolution is amazing and it works perfectly fine. the product got to me on time and is in perfect conditions. completely recommend the seller and the phone! :). es mucho mas que un telã©fono, sus aplicaciones son fantasticas, es rã¡pido, estable y tiene excelentes grã¡ficos. fuã© una buena compra .   very light and great performance. good look and high quality videos & photos, free apps, and much more .   the only weakness: battery life. if you're buying this phone, you have to have in mind several things: 1. it is a big phone. i myself find the screen size very useful, but if you have small hands or don't have a fancy for big phones, this isn't for you. 2. operating system is fast; if you have previously owned an iphone you will find it quite easy to shift toward an android platform. 3. headphones have a good sound to them as long as you are standing still. if you're a jogger, you will find that the cable transmit every little tapping sound right back to your inner ear. solution? yes, run the cable underneath your clothes. 4. on screen keyboard is not always accurate. 5. excellent camera: takes beautiful pictures and comes with several different shutter modes, including a panorama software. 6. many of the apps are free on the google play store. 7. battery charger, unfortunately, is european standard. you'll need an adapter. overall, it's a pretty good phone. and once you get used to the size of it (which takes only a couple of days) every other phone will seem toy-like .   i choosed this rate because my mobile it's not working at 100% so i want to know if you are gonna do something about thisl. i've been (and still am) a mac person but i everything i heard about android made me try it. i used a blackberry for years and, at times, i miss it. the galaxy 3 is a great phone, among many other things; too many for me. but i'm learning. the only thing that sometimes annoys me is that it decides to do things spontaneously. editing and erasing stuff is not obvious, although there is vast amount of support on the web. i'm enjoying it .   i bought 3 of this smartphone, for my family. 2 of them are excellent one of them stop working after 1 month of use. thanks to the amazon costumer service i got my money back, after i sent it back. i rated it only 4 srars becust of this .   el telã©fono es muy bueno, es muy rã¡pido el procesador integrado, lo cual lo convierte en una gran herramienta de trabajo, altamente recomendada. good. seems to be fragile, but besides that quite nice! extremely light. the screen is large but it's steel possible to handle it with single hand .   it is simply amazing, great design, lightweight, very thin, ultra fast, longer battery life compared to others, sd slot, nfc, quad core, hd display. the gestures control from samsung gives you a better control and interface over other androids an ios phones. those kind of little details give the real meaning of smartphone. it may be expensive, but i worth it .   lost by ups waiting for another one sent by dealer. retailer should atomatically send another one when one is lost by the carrier .   you must buy it! go go go now! you will be very glad with this smartphone all the app works really good. phone arrived with a uk electric plug, nos plug so i can only recharge the phone by connect through a usb plug to a computer. after several attempts to deliver because there was no one to sign, i asked that they deliver without signature. they refused .   i am really loving this phone. the only complaint that i have on this phone, is that you have to have a samsung printer if you want to print anything from this phone .   i highly recommend this phone .   hi, the phone work fine but it has any scratch in the borders for the rest working very nice. it was the only bad .   "excellent phone. as described was factory unlocked & the international version. i'm using it in south american without a problem. after setting up the phone and as soon i put the sim card was making phone calls and receiving emails. ". this phone was an upgrade from a nexus one and i couldn't be happier with my purchase. it's fast, has a great battery life and a beautiful screen. the firmware updated a few weeks ago to jelly bean (4.1.1). everyday i discover more features and reasons to be happy with my purchase. i have been using this phone for almost 3 months .   it's great phone. very intuitive. nice sleek design and responsive touchscreen. very easy to transfer files from pc and mac .   realmente recomendable, hace 2 aã±os comprã© el galaxy s (i9000) y me saltee la versiã³n s2, hoy en dã­a tuve la oportunidad de hacer el salto a la versiã³n i9300 y estoy realmente conforme. el envã­o se hizo en tiempo y forma .   i have had many many other smart phones but this is so smooth and awesome phone yet. i am not a iphone user and never will. i have downloaded over 34 apps from the google play store and for free. i have downloaded over 15 apps/games for my son to play on and for free. don't know why anyone would buy anything else. also, i downloaded the avg antivirus app and wow, it updates and scans everyday. only once my son did something and it was stuck but very easy, i went to task manager and click to cancel that app and it was fixed. that easy. the best phone ever. thanks samsung. please keep up the good work .   de la tecnologã­a moderna. muy lindo, barato y llega a tiempo. buena empresa vendedora, sigan adelante, ofeciendo productos de calidad, a buen precio y cumpliendo con los tiempos. translation is beautiful, works perfect. i like it. does not have any detail. this desbloquedo factory. arrived in good condition. i recommend it .   i had zero problems with my transaction with seller. my phone arrived exactly when i was told it would and in perfect condition! it is exactly what i ordered, and i couldn't be happier! the galaxy s3 is an amazing phone, with fantastic battery life. i practically live with my phone attached to me for e-mails, texts, tango and skype video chatting, facebooking, and so much more. i can run my phone all day long, from the time i get out of bed til i got to sleep and it still has battery life. i couldn't ask for more than that. my only complaint about this phone is with picture taking .   my old phone had a button on the side that made it easy to hold and click for pictures. with the s3, you have to click in the lower middle phone screen to take a pic, and it's awkward to hold and click if you are taking a front facing picture. i am sure there is a work-around for this one minor issue, and i just haven't found it yet. other than that .   love, love, love my phone. i've had it for a couple weeks now and wonder how i ever managed without it before. :). i have to say this phone is the perfect mix between fashion and power, it's just an awesome phone .   samsung congratulations. does everything as advertized. couple of things for the people that wants an easy-to-use phone. this one has many menus and you need to customize a lot of things to have it the way you want it. if you don't mind expending some time to get this done then pick this phone. otherwise if you like a a phone that has less things to do and almost ready to use out-of-the-box then you need to look at another option. there is no high quality headphones with mic and remote control yet that work with this phone. that is a thing to consider if you are seeking for a good music sound. the oem headphones are ok but not great. the performance is great, a all those widgets that you can get make it something to play a lot with. just love that .   the phone is fun and better than iphone. lots of fun things to play with and more free apps (while iphone apps need to pay). however, if you want to use it for tmobile, it sucks. data always just keep loading, loading, and loading. finally it stopped or dropped .   if you want to get this for tmobile, think twice. i'll need to change the carrier to att instead .  or i guess tmobile just sucks .   i cannot turn the phone on suddenly .   i've been useing this phone for three month, and then, i just cannot turn on the cell phone the next day after i charged it .   be careful when you buy this one .   everybody enjoys upgrading their phone or we wouldn't upgrade, would we? of all my phone upgrades, this one is my favorite - from galaxy s2 toâ samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version (pebble blue). there is a huge improvement in wait time at boot up and that includes comparison with other phones that don't have carrier software/bloatware. overall, my expectations have been more than exceeded in the areas of: speed response gorgeous screen giving better google navigation experience as well as movies, etc. better size and shape feels more durable and less like plastic improved intuitiveness i let google and amazon backups restore/install to my new phone and everything was seamless except for one thing. where oh where did the microphone key go on the keyboard? i love to dictate just about everything! oh no! it took me 30 minutes to find the answer. hold down the settings key, until you see the microphone key. select the microphone key and now the microphone key is where it is supposed to be on the keyboard and one must remember that if you want to change keyboard settings, you must hold down the microphone key until you see the settings icon key to select. this phone requires a micro sim and i let a friend with a micro sim cutter cut it rather than following the youtube videos on how to cut yours with a knife or scissors. the micro sim cutter looks like a hold bunch and really makes sure everything goes well. amazon sells them as wellâ noosy [2nd generation] micro sim cutter, with 2 sim adapters (color: black or silver)â and/orâ icoolkit new iphone nano sim card to micro /stander/ full sim card tray adapter holderâ which i think is well worth the money if you don't have a friend that already purchased one. i just adore how i can customize and optimize phone to my usage and preferences. with all my other upgrades, i have held the phone and asked myself "is this worth the $$$ to upgrade to this phone?" and after careful consideration i decide yes but just barely. this upgrade, i immediately whole-heartedlly respond "best $500 i've spent in some time!" woweee .   it's everything i wanted and more. after 1 month .   am still discovering the features and have no complaints at all. best buy ever .   i absolutely love my siii. . size took a while getting used to though because i have small hands but all in all it was worth the buy .   the only other issue though was that the sim card from my carrier was too big for the micro sim slot, so i had to cut it down to size by removing the excess plastic surrounding it .   loved it. but a lot of apps keep crashing during rotation of screen. skype is the worst of all. gmail app is unable to push notifications. whether it is a problem with current android version or the apps is a different question altogether. it just,  .   err, sometimes feels irritating to have those problems with a "smart" phone .   it's a good smartphone. i'm lovin. it's fast, beautiful and slim. the iphone is past, the s3 is very better. the seller is very good too. very fast and professional. this is an excellent product, the best cellular than i've ever had this is another world. bye bb 100% recommend. basically this is my first smart phone, so for me this phone is like out of this world. i just enjoy the android apps on this and also the web surfing experience is truly amazing .   product "international version" seems to mean no samsung support and no samsung warranty. surge telecom is less than useless they seem to not care. check blogs and check surge telecom site. a product on there site talks about a bad component in the s3 international and offers a product that they claim to correct it. after your 15 day return window closes then the 30 day a to z insurance is over you are on your own .   i bought this item for my mother who is now in late 50s. she wanted a smartphone so i got her something that had a good review with reasonable price and big screen size for her bad sight. as i was using it, it was very complicated since access to the setting was not so friendly. for android, you do not have access to most of the applications through device's setting, but you have to go to its own setting to control it. also, for this device, you have to touch-and-drag to open the phone. to parents like mine have little knowledge or sense for that. it took her 3 days to figure out. now she thinks you have to touch-and-drag all the applications to open it. she will take a long time to get used to this phone. maybe this phone is for more young, new generation who know how to use touch screen properly. do not recommend it for parents if you are merely getting it for the size of its screen. yes, for me, i think it's pretty decent device to use where you can do so many things .   the galaxy siii is a direct competitor to the iphone 5. it is in many respects superior to the iphone but because of the many versions of phones using android os, the android os lags behind in apps that do audio like guitar amp simulaton software. i expect that it will catch up soon. the larger screen is a big plus for me. it's sharp, bright and the colors accurate and well saturated. the 8 megapixel camera is as good as many point shoot stand alone cameras. this thing is solid and can take licking. i haven't tried it myself but if you look up the torture test on cnet's "always on" program with molly wood. you'll see that this thing can take a beating. all in all, it is an impressive phone .   many thanks for your commitment with this product. my wife love it, all the items arrived without any problem or defect. besides, the phone and all the items received were as it was described. many thanks again. eliecer .   for me it was the best phone i ever had so far, great graphics, excellent performance. i recommend to all who are in search of a good phone .   love this phone! i switched from a droid 2 global with slider keyboard to this phone because i have been using my phone for tv-viewing on hulu plus, netflix, and other apps like those daily. i wanted a bigger screen size and better quality resolution of the video image. i was not disappointed. the camera is fantastic too! the photos come out great and anything i view looks clear and bright. one let down was that they kept advertizing that you can minimize your video and txt, email, browse, while continuing to watch. don't be fooled: it is only videos you watch in their native viewer and does not work with hulu and netflix, etc. oh well. small sacrificed on my expectations for a great phone. oh, and the google play music cloud is amazing! i uploaded my 3,000 songs to the cloud and can now listen to them anytime from anywhere without taking up storage space on my phone. seller was also very responsive, helpful, and quick .   this is by far is the best phone awesome speed and performance. one side note: this isn't the international version, this is yes optus branded preload. to remove all the yes optus preload software you have to update via odin with another ics or jb version. ( thanks to qvnsq@ [ .  ] ). i bought this phone for a friend and he is very satisfied with the purchase. it was all what he wanted for the price paid. it outweiged all the expectations. very functional and nice looking phone. the phone could almost make coffee in the morning. after updating firmware to lattest version its even better. only issue is that the usb cord which is also used to charge the phone does not fit very well so when plugging to it sometimes losses connection. had to put a book on top of it so it would keep the weight and does not release the usb. i might buy a docking cradle for this .   el samsung galaxy s3 es extraordinario tiene muy buena resolucion es elegante se puede manipular con facilidad tiene excelentes aplicaciones. i bought my phone on september 28. but i broke my phone screen. how could i do? do you provide guarantee to repair my phone .   the phone is one of the best smart phones ever, but this international version isnt what i was expecting. the manual and datasheets are in a rare european language and the charger is for the european standar. it isnt a real problem because adapters can be used but i was really surprised .   i think it is good. the screen is large.and you can insert the micro-sd card. it is better than iphone. i love it .   i definitely recommend this phone. it's fast, the screen is great. it comes with the same bloatware that's installed on most phones these days, but samsung did us a favor by shipping with an unlocked bootloader, so if you're technically skilled you can install cyanogenmod on it. it can run jellybean or ics this way. the two that we received are both the unlocked i9300 international versions. i would be quite unhappy if i ordered it and received the locked at&t version as some reviewers here are describing .   i did not buy this phoine for me. i got it for a cousin. anyways, he's very satisfied with the phone. it has great reviews all around the web as one of the best cell phones in the market. it looks great too. the screen is quite large and the resolution is very good. the processor is very fast and the connectivity is great. i especially like the fact that you can expand the memory, unlike the iphone in which you can't. this is a very nice product. highly recommended .   excellent phone also come on time, better than any other smart phone i had before excellent and exactely as was described on line, very glad .   surekli nokia kullanmis biri olarak ilk kez baska bir markaya gectim ve gercekten nokia da gecen yillarima uzuldum. nokianin bircok ozelligini uzerinde barindirdigini soylemesine ragmen iki program ayni anda cok agir geliyordu. fakat samsung s3 de skype basta olmak uzere bir suru program ayni anda calisabiliyor ve bana misin demiyor .   samsung just created great device. its meet whole of my expectations. its easy to use and loveable :) love to have galaxy s iii. delivery was lightning quick. the phone is beautiful, feels great in my hand and fun to use. bought this phone to use with straight talk so far no problems. i have the samsung galaxy tablet 10 so was already familiar with the icons etc. i know this phone does so much more than i have been able to figure out. i hate predictive words takes me longer to write because i have to go back and delete. uggh. this phone is really great and coming from the htc g2 to this was an easy transition. it's very user friendly. however with t-mobile, it will only work on edge not 3g or 4g; didn't know that. however, i returned the phone and i knew there would be a restocking fee applied, but $55 is unnecessarily steep and considering the return address is someone's house is a little ridiculous. won't be ordering from this seller again .   at first, i felt guilty for spending so much on a cellphone, but i really wanted it and needed a good and new device. it was delivered even before the estimated date and everything was perfectly in place. it's easy to use and has many options i think are amazing and fun, like sharing photos by just touching the back of the phones, instant sharing when you take a picture, calling a contact by simply putting the phone on your ear, watching videos while using some other thing on your phone, and many others. it doesn't even feel like you have a phone in your pocket. it's extremely thin and fits right in your hand. the big screen is better than the small iphone/ipod ones. the touchscreen responds extremely quickly. the camera has an amazing quality and the photos look gorgeous. i highly recommend this item for anyone who's willing to spend some extra money on a quality phone .   hi i just want to mention that this international version supports only edge not 3g or 4g with t mobile connection. i didnt try with other carrier. please be aware, i am not sure if there is any other way to make it work on 3g. it is fast delivery and it is running good now. it was unclock, can use it with any plane i want. thank you very much. fantastic smartphone. the best one. much better than iphone 4s (i had one). sorry about my english, i'm from brazil .   this cellphone is wonderfull. very fast abd with it, you always will be connected. everyone who buy this phone will enjoy it .   after using blackberry for over 5 years, i made the decision to try the android line of phones. after doing some research on both the motorola droid max and the samsung galaxy s3; i settled on the samsung. the phone lives up to all the specifications only negative is its battery live. i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a serious android phone .   im really happy with this phone, it looks great, runs fastest, its like a computer. the battery its great even when its so powerfull. theres more, if you like playing around with kernel roms, then this is your beacause you can easyly root it and start tweaking around .   excelente compra, es garantizada, posee todas las funciones que un smart phone debe tener. fue una buena decisiã³n. lo recomiendo .   great phone, currently using with unlimited data plan on at&t hspa+, this will not work with tmobile hspa+ in most areas since it lacks 1700 aws band (t mobile is currently rolling out 1900 for international phones and iphone users and plans to use 1700 for lte in the future). get a nexus if you're going to use t-mobile. this phone is great but i took 1 star for lack of exynos sources. if you want to know, my galaxy s3 i9300 came with french and german manuals (not that anyone reads those). i bought mine from fgs trading. my phone's csc is lux (luxembourg) but english was the default set language on the phone it is now updated to jellybean. touch wiz on ics is slow but is pretty fast on jellybean .   went from iphone 4s to galaxy s3. getting used to it and using doubletwist for itunes music. just tired of the whole apple monopoly and arrogance. phone worked great out of the box with extra directions from shipper. using straight talk with no difficulty in getting that setup .   great phone .   best galaxy ever, best phone in the market! i was between this and the i5, i decided for the s3 because of the screen and the so. i love my phone. this review is for both the phone and the store. after 4 hours of using the s3, the phone fell from me and the screen is not working any more.it was an easy fall though. the store: -i contacted the store directly. they direct me to cpr store in mountain view,ca and they told me that the store will fix it for free if it is not a physical damage. but guess what, the technician said we do not know them .   - i ask them if i can take it to samsung us they told me you can. when i contacted samsung us,they said they do not support the international phone version. - i contacted hassel free again they said ooh you should contact samsung uk :( samsung: -i contact samsung us they said that the phone is not under thier warranty, they support only the phone that is only for the us market .   "i think what i have is a samsung phone" and they gave me a number to contact.guess what the number was fake .   hahahaha - i go to chat with their ******* support team, they direct me to samsung india. - samsung india said we do not support the device hahahaha. - i contacted the store again and they direct me to samsung uk.samsung uk told me to send the device to uk whith me paying for the shipping .   what a customer service. the conclusion is the follwing: - the store fool us on not showing that the device is supported only in uk. - samsung customer service is horrible, why do not they support their products where ever it is purchased from. all of the above is documented if any one need to learn about the issue furthermore .   this is the best phone i ever had, it's just amazing how fast it is and how easy to use. like they said it's the iphone killer .   i was concern about if this handset was a real factory unlock or not, but after test with two. diferent carrier .it work perfectly. it seems is a "corean version" of the phone, but not problem with it. intructions in several languagues and the phone defaul is english so .   it was perfect. the international version work on most of the bands for other american countries .   my phone got one automatic firmware update but still is working perfectly .   the only gsiii issue is the weak logic control between wi-fi and 3g/hsdpa .   it doesn't switch smooth as the iphone 4. i hope this issue samsung fix it on next software release. regarding the seller everything was ok .   excelente vendedor todo se realizo como lo describe y el producto excelente este vendedor lo recomiendo los envio son rapidos y seguro. met and has exceeded my expectations; especially being a previous owner of a blackberry. application space is significant! easy to use. takes beautiful pictures. though it is a bigger phone than the blackberry, it is light and still hold in a pocket. you will need a microsim .   i think the phone is better than iphone 5. i enjoy everyday the amount of technology that the phone have .   as to the unit, i am enjoying now .  love it .  most esp the camera not to mention its applications .  very useful  .  unfortunately my headphone hasnt arrive yet because thats the only item that was not working well .  i ended up buying new set .  to sum it all, the s3 phone is really amazing. i got this phone on monday and i got a straight talk sim. my friend got the at&t unlocked version and he gets 4g but all i get is edge network. i have tried everything from calling straight talk to calling samsung. im confused as to why this is happening when it says in the description that it should have 3g or 4g. i give the device a 5 star definitely. but the seller surge telecom i give 0 stars for sending me the wrong product. now they refuse to accept a return on it because its opened. how else would i know it was the wrong product if i didn't open it .   i need to know if you really sell the quadcore version because i bought a s3 thinking is the quadcore version and result that is the dualcore im from venezuela and i cant return the product. unfortunately, my experience with this s3 was the worst possible. i ordered one and shipped it to my parents that were in ny, so they could bring it back to me in brazil. when arriving, the s3 just didn't work, as the touch screen was not responding to any command. i upgraded the android os, but was not helpful. so, the only solution was to return the item to the seller as samsung brazil refused to fix the problem here. they told me that the warranty is only valid for the country you buy the product. a joke .   as a consequence, i had my money back, but i'm still with no phone. maybe iphone 5 or lumia 9200 will do better than s3 did .   tudo perfeito, ã³timo celular, sã³ nã£o estã¡ atualizando segunda a samsung estã¡ as liberando. infelicidade, quero atualiza-lo logo. amei esse celular, perfeito. iphone ã© para os fracos .   best price online, a lot better than iphone. i bought few months ago an iphone 4s but since i used the s3 i sold my 4s and change it for the s3, strongly recommended .   this is the most fantastic mobile phone available in the world. i am very happy now using this product. i recomend it for everyone. clean,nice phone.delivery on time.very nice and net but i bought this phone for my wife she is a simple mobile customer talk and txt work perfect,but internet connection will drop every 10 min. i think it's the international version,so the frequency of the internet is different from the us carriers. you have to know before you buy this device.i return this phone with respect .   i already had some pretty high expectations when purchasing the gs3. i had heard great things, but i had never used a samsung phone. i previously owned an iphone 4 and was simply tired of apple trying to disguise lack of innovation with their typical marketing gimmicks. here's what i thought about the gs3: the screen is bigger, it already can operate on 4g networks, the operating system was just as fast (if not faster) as ios and the camera took great quality pictures. the android system sticks with google maps, which apple decided to abandon this time around, and you see where that got them. and here's the kicker: the international unlocked version of this phone was nearly $200 dollars cheaper than the iphone 5. so far i have only discovered one shortcoming. when using s-voice the phone's data plan needs to be enabled or you must be connected to wifi. i'm not sure why this is necessary as some of the voice commanded functionality does not require google. for example, 'send message to steve: why doesn't s-voice work when i'm not connected to the internet?' this message would elicit the automated voice (from the drone woman living inside the phone) saying 'network unavailable.' again, this is the only disappointment thus far. overall i do not even slightly regret my purchase decision .   this is the first time purchasing an unlocked phone and here was my experience: - awesome product! - it came brand new as described with whatever was supposed to come in the box. - after 7 years with at&t (and i never had any trouble with them) i ported one of my numbers and decided to go with straighttalk (available at walmart or [ .  ] - i purchased the $59 pack that included a $15 sim card (the packet came with three of them) and $45 of unlimited minutes, text and data for a month. - i followed the directions inserted the sim in the phone and called straighttalk to activate. lo and behold i started receiving calls after a couple of hours. hope this helps .   this phone is very good! i have the international version and it's really amazing! i highly recommend this phone! cheers .   hi , i just want to say that i got the phone on time and in perfect shape the only problem i have was that the charger was not consist with my country (i needed a eu charger and i got us) thanks ido. fast shipment. nice phone. unlocked. currently using it overseas without any problems. the only problem is phone does not come with an universal wall plug charger. you need to buy a converter in order to use it in some countries .   able to access web without data plan with the factory unlocked plan. cost wise bit costly, but it is worthy. this is probably the best phone out there. iphone 5 is nowhere near the gs3. been using it for a month now and i'm still exhilarated by it's display. worth every penny .   i have been really confused between iphone and galaxy s3 and did lot of research before making final decision. i am very happy with my galaxy s3 it is just amazing phone. my biggest worry before purchase was its size but actually i am very comfortable with its size, size is just right for me .   this mobile is amazing. it is factory unlocked and it's the international version due to having so many languages installed. i received the french packaged version, and everything was in french, which is amazing as well. works with my vodafone uk, has great screen size, and is fast. the package itself says it all on what type of mobile you can expect out of the box. overall it's a phenomenal device. so far so good .   while in u.s.a. my daughter purchased for my use in india samsung galaxy s3 international version unlocked white color online from amazon.com. i tried to register it on u.s.a. website and on indian website also, but cannot register it on either site with my indian address. please guide me. also i am using it for last 15 days but even in standby mode battery does not last more than 5 hours. in reviews on the internet before purchase i read that the standby time is 800 hours & talk time is 22 hours. therefore, though the product is excellent otherwise, i am disappointed for the battery part. please help .   many reviews for this product, so i am simply talking about after the 4.1 update: now with the update to android 4.1 jellybean, this phone just got a whole lot better and faster. jellybean does not support adobe flash, but just search xda-developers or google and you will find a flash file compatible with the galaxy s3 on jellybean that works quite fine. this means just about all of the ice-cream sandwich features have been retained and the jellybean features have simply been added. also, samsung always makes sure that the experience remains consistent, so the learning curve from ics to jellybean is minimal. differences since upgrading to 4.1: longer battery life smoother scrolling faster web browser google now more available ram user experience has been polished on a whole the only negative point is when u open the menu, there is a lag if u hit the widgets tab and start to scroll immediately, hurts my eyes, but besides that i can think of nothing else. 5 stars deserved, good work samsung. if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. this product is exactly as described. it is definitely the international version of the phone. it is perfect. delivery was prompt and in excellent condition. this phone from this seller is a must have .   5 stars all the way. do not listen to anyone saying this isn't the international version .   it's all they say about this cell.ithink it's too much tecnology for us in brasil.great buy. i recomend it for all amazon buyers. very surprised by the poor service from this seller and amazon, we buy this cellphone and a month of using the phone stopped charging, i wrote to the supplier and amazon to apply the guarantee but referred me to contact samsung, samsung told me they apply the warranty only to phones purchased in her page directly. it was very disappoinedbecause anyone fix me the problem and i paid for a very expensive phone .   i had a great purchase experience! plus the product delivers what it promises! i always had iphones, but right now things seems easier to do and also much quicker, due to its processor. off course it has its cons against the other phone, but still very good product. only real bad thing about it is battery life, it is almost short as the other phone. when used in full capacity, 3g, checking emails, facebook, instagram and etc. the battery life won't last a full day. but the great thing about this phone is that gives you the option to have an extra battery. all in all it's worth it .   the phone works fine and you basicly dont need a laptop or cpu no more because the galaxy does it all .  its fast and the picture taking is great .  its way better then the iphone 4 or 5  .  if you was thinking about a iphone vs a galaxy pick the galaxy and this is from a former iphone 4 user .  all you doing with apple is buying a name brand and with the galaxy it offers tons of options and things to do .   product arrived on time, brand new and in excellent condition. my daughter really enjoys this phone, she likes better than iphone. thank you .   producto llegã³ s tiempo y en buenas condiciones y si lo pudee ocupar en mi paã­s lo que quiere decir que si esta desbloqueado para utilizarlo con cualquier opersdoforavde telefonã­a en cualquier paã­s. excelente equipo lã¡stima que en mi paã­s aun no funciona 4g (venezuela), es tan potente como dicen, muy superior s la competencia iphone 5. this is not an international version. only small sim card works. doesn't work with all companies. i am so frustrated .   nov 1, 2012 update on my phone. when it worked, it was great & i loved it. now at&t & myself can't get it to work, even with new sim cards. won't recognize at&t data signals. so my $600.00 smart phone is now dumb & i hate that it doesn't work! i can only make & receive calls (maybe). at&t is unable to get my phone to work properly, 4 calls to customer service & 2 times at at&t store with no resolution. samsung us will not help because it's international phone. i did not want an international phone, just an unlocked phone. so buyer beware, you may have problems with the unlocked international phone on at&t or t-mobile. oct 4, 2012 i'm being asked to review the galaxy s3 gt-19300 international version pebble blue (which is ultimately what i received in the mail). however .   what i purchased from amazon (looking at my printed order as i type this) was, "samsung galaxy s3 unlocked gsm smart phone (pebble blue). sold by trd-trading gmbh." there was nothing in the title or the product description/details to indicate this was an unlocked international phone. surprise on delivery .   the package arrived on 9/5/12 after the stated delivery date of 8/31/2012. when i opened the package from global mobiles, i found european charger, us adaptor, german & english language instructions booklets, german apps, german voice recognition, and some typed instructions on how to get phone to work on us cell service. well i'm not a techno geek, so this was a little puzzling for me to figure out quickly & easily. i have purchased many items through amazon and have always been satisfied. however, i was disappointed in the representation of this product. i would have wanted to know before my purchase that i was purchasing an international unlocked phone. buyer beware, a little more truth in advertising. it took myself & the at&t rep almost an hour to get the phone working correctly & remove german language issues for the voice recognition. i was finally able to remove the pre-installed german apps after several days of attempts (they kept coming back), i think they are finally gone. the one big drawback so far (aside from the initial stuff) the battery life is not so great & i have it on battery saving mode. i have to recharge every day. my old samsung capitvate went for days before needing a charge. is there a solution for this battery issue? otherwise, this is a great phone. i'll take android any day. another big plus, i'm not locked into a contract & don't have all the bloatware that cell providers think you need & want. so far, i'm happy with the phone & when i figure out all it can do, i'll love it. i also think the unlocked international version is probably the better version. also, i have been unable to find the user manual for the gt-19300. the samsung site does not show one & google searches have not come up with any. has anyone found the user manual for the galaxy s3 gt-19300 .   i love the phone, but i dont understand why it doesnt have the "samsung galaxy s3"written on the back, like a tmobile phone would ? does it mean anything  .   sg3 is great, it is really a smarth phone. the phone arrived one day after i ordered it, i have used the phone in us and mexico without any problem. this is by far the best cel phone i've ever had! excellent product, i totally recommendit! there are so many features on it, i'm positively surprised .   i'm a previous iphone user but i just fell in love with this cel phone. the quality of the graphics is just amazing. the only drawback is that it is a little too big. i'm a girl, so i just put it in my purse and the problem is solved, but for a guy i must admit that it can be tricky to put it in one's pocket. also, for those living in south america, let me tell you it works perfectly with claro, although you may need to buy a micro sim card if you don't already own one .   i love the performance, and the functionality. got the phone for four days, played with it everyday and the phone got dropped from above waist level. the screen protector is still applied to the screen so you can't really see an inside crack .  the glass is fine but i can see two short lines on the screen. i can no longer use the phone since the lcd is broken. i was telling myself that i have got to get a case for this phone asap before it got dropped since the quality is so cheaply made .   unluckily, it got dropped and now i am screwed :(. good lucky people, protect this phone while you can .   i just got the phone and i'm very happy with it. is very fast and i love the led display. the phone is very small and light which is very good. the only bad thing is, i'm using t-mobile as a carrier and with that you will not get 4g speed, only e. i try every way to get 4g but nothing works. if anyone here knows how to get 4g with t-mobile on this phone, please help me. thanks .   compre ese telefono y no me environ el correcto me environ otro modelo decia que desbloqueado y aquã­ en aruba no lo he podido usar serã¡ que me pueden explicar que puedo hacer como hacer para que me solucionen el problema. i just got my new phone and i'm loving it. the shipment was really quick, and the phone is in perfect conditions .   i feel very disappointed. i was expecting the international version, and i got the at&t us version sgh-i747 it does not seem to be factory unlocked. all the software is tied to at&t. if you advertise the product as a the international version that is what i expect to get. i would consider to return the device, sadly i had not enough time until i got back to peru. this is very dissapointed. always love the iphone but since i have bought the samsung galaxy s3 i realize that i love love love it. great phone with great features and apps for a great price. it's value for money. i recommend it to everyone .   excellent as expected. very fast phone and the best android phone so far. i already installed jelly bean and i'm loving it. for buyers gt-i9300 or international version is the quad core but it only have 1gb of ram. i noticed that it consumes a lot of battery if you use most of the features like sensor, wifi, gps and gaming. just maximize your battery by turning on all power saving features, lower the brightness of the screen and use dark wall paper. i hope i don't encounter any problem with the phone since it's been excellent so far. i noticed though that upon unlocking your device when you press the power button the screen has a delay and will not lit up immediately unlike other htc phones that i have .   nothing like samsung galaxy s3 - it beats all my expectations! i was a s2 user and was already convinced about s3. the phone is worth every penny .   amazon now charges tax and so now we see the end of an era. prices will go up as sales decline, and so will taxes thanks to the elected big government advocates and those who keep them in office. i simply have nothing to benefit from amazon's business anymore. worldwide distributors is a marketplace vendor for amazon and is also a good reason to find another source for your cell phone needs. they claim to be a california based company and so charged me tax on this order before the amazon september 15 deadline. california based companies typically have my packages delivered to me within two days. however, there was no indication that this product was going to be shipped from florida. now a week later it is still in transit. for some reason it takes four days for this company to prepare its shipments when bigger companies often have my orders shipped out on the very same day. i then asked them to send my package with usps since both fedex and ups have a record of losing my packages, but some companies have no concern for your needs despite the little statement they send out saying: "our goal is for you to be completely satisfied with this transaction". uh, well, this is the curt reply i received back to my request: "we do not ship this item via usps, it will be shipped fedex for international and ups for states thank you." yep, that is a real attempt to satisfy a customer. no? so now i have to wait for nearly two weeks for this item to arrive after its excursion across the us because worldwide distributors is too cheap to take a couple of dollars of the huge profit they are making off this sale and provide overnight or second day service as they would do for their friends. now under the care of ups, the chances of this high interest item getting lost are tripled when it passes through the notoriously evil downtown la distribution center. ever wondered why your ups packages look so beat up when delivered? so, worldwide distributors, don't ever expect to get any favorable review from me. the samsung galaxy s3 is second in popularity to the apple iphone. it is highly praised for its abilities, many of which are better than what the iphone is capable of, and covered to a greater extent by real experts. so you won't really benefit from a review of this item by me, and i will only update if ups loses my phone, or if the phone worldwide distributors sends me turns out to be a real piece of useless trash .   i bought this phone because i like being untethered as opposed to the iphone total lock down. looking at it online it seemed a little big but after i got it in realised how sleek and nice it feels in the hand and pocket. it is really fast, smooth and feature rich. as with all android phones it is supported by 600,0000 applications. this is like. the best part about this is that all the features now available on the iphone 5 were on the galaxy long before. most people don't realise but the iphone is actually behind in terms of features. it you want features and to be untethered get this phone .   i'd been using samsung "memoir" for the past 4 yrs. but this galaxy s3 provided so many advanced features that i'm still learning. its big screen and its abilities to magnifying small details on pictures really help me explaining to my friends. av is also very clearer. iphone-5 can't beat this. it is simply a computer in my pocket. thanks to samsung .   hi guys. i am currently 14 days into using this phone and i have to say that i am loving it. i purchased the sim card from straight talk and had the phone dialing and receiving the day i got the card in the mail. this means i am on a gs3 with a 41$/mo unlimited everything plan. in case you're worried, you will not see problems with overages because this phone does wireless so well you will almost never use data mbs. love this phone, and it can be had for a reasonable amount, with no contract. even if you can't get into this phone for the full 600 and have to go with a carrier for a cheaper phone, do it. this is the phone that will get you through the next 3 years without costing that much more and with everything you need to be cool and informed. 3 years at this price is a steal. things i don't love: camera should be 12 mps to really make this phone shine the manual should have something about how you shouldn't put a screen protector on a gs3 and why overpriced, samsung should be offering this phone with 64 gbs not 16 for this price. i've owned many phones throughout the years; this is, by far, the best phone ever. i have absolutely no negative feedback for it. it's fabulous, it's amazing. the screen is huge, every time i look at someone else's phone, i think to myself, it's so small! i am pretty sure i could download every app available and never run out of space. it's internet is faster than my laptop's internet. it looks expensive and impressive. it's just great. :) edit>>>> first of all, the other reviewer is correct, the phone is in french with french applications, but i felt like that was not so difficult to fix. you will only be able to use samsung's french customer service though, good luck with that, haha. more importantly, apparently unlocked phones can only get up to 2g/edge network coverage. so, even though this is a 4g capable phone, you will not be able to take advantage of that. i did not see this anywhere on the product information page and i believe this is very important for you to know before you make your purchase. you will not get 3g/4g .   it was t-mobile based but the dealer paid for the unlocking code. the galaxi is great. the screen, the apps, everything .   perfect phone. it's fast, light and has a very good battery life. it's 32gb as mentioned .   not 16gb with a 16gb sd card .   received the phone fast and without trouble. it was in mint condition and booted up perfected. have now used it for around a month on a daily basis and it has not let me down in any way yet. would definitely recommend this to others in search of a phone and place to buy. my only grievance was that the charger that came with the phone was with the european socket and that the adapter (nice gesture) that was there did not work. fortunately my old phone was an android as well and so the phone could still be charged. but since this was an "extra", it does not change how i feel about the phone .   tiempo de respuesta mejor no puede ser, siempre compro los telefonos en esta tienda los recomiendo 100%, compren aqui con garantia. forget the others. choose s3 and enjoy it. everything is on this phone what you expect. strongly recommend to buy external microsdhc card with this phone. also if you have a samsung smart tv you will see more benefits of s3 .   amazing cellphone, but i didn't know that this t-mobile phone only have 2 cores (1,5 ghz :/ ) if i knew that i would bought another model with 4 cores (1,4 ghz) .   at least, this phone has 2 gb of ram. i have had many cellphones. this is the best phone that i have ever owned. the best thing about this phone is i don't think i'll have to buy a new phone for a long time .   this phone is another i-phone 4s killer-it replaced my "i". it has it all and it is even better on the android market. very fast web browsing and cool screen .   the celphone is working great in panamã¡. thank for your rapid delivery. the only problem is that you send the wrong electrical charging cord. americans had been in panamã¡ since 1903 and therefore we use same electrical product that is used in usa. [asin:b00812ywxu samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version (ceramic white)]]. just bought this phone and this is what i think: 1/pro: nice phone with large screen. nice color, fast android operating sys. a lot of functions. 2/con: this phone is from europe(main language was dutch or german. make sure you know how to switch it to your language). also has 2 micro sim slots (if you have the regular sim you have to cut it down to fit in). no memory card included. there're alot of apps running in the back cause the battery drain quick (need to know how to close them). i loved this phone initially, but within 3 weeks the phone stopped working. now it won't turn on or charge. i have to send back to hong kong for repair. be careful of unlocked phones .   the top of android smart phones, not an astounding apple device but like pc does the work excellent and interfacing with all, recommended .   this truly is a great device, but sadly i've received one that has the cellular problem. when making incoming or outgoing calls the phone will connect, but no sound is heard on either end. and if left connected for about 10 seconds the call will drop and i will loose connection from the cellular network for a min. i've searched high and low for a solution .   i've tried god knows how many different roms .   i've changed basebands .   factory reset, but no avail .   the problem persists. im certain that it's a hardware problem because if you tap the back of the phone you can sometimes hear the audio cutting in and out. from what i've read online the only solution is to send it back to samsung, and apparently they change the motherboard .   but thats a bit difficult in my situation as i live in the cayman islands. other than that pesky problem i love my s3 .   this is a great device. nice with powerful applications .   bye bye i-phone .   welcome galaxy s iii .   android is the best. i got the galaxy s3, nice phone the screen is very very nice. is a super toy. however, i had to return it since the galaxy s3 has some issues you may get at the beggining or later on. first, when the phone is locked for a few minutes, you are not able to unlocked you have to re-start it. nice you will not be able to recieve calls. this seems to be a popular bug with samsung. then the battery life is not that good. finally the screen burns when you use it for a while. probably mine was a defective one but samsung support or the seller support on amazon is terrible. i guess i will spend a few more dollars but will get and iphone, maybe not as nice as samsung but at least works .   at the time of this review this is the best android smartphone. that's what i expected when ordered and when i got it, i was not disappointed. those familiar with android will find all usual features, in a fast responding hardware, a beautiful large screen and a very thin and slick profile. also some nice samsung widgets and apps that come with it make initial configuration quick. the phone came unlocked and i was able to use my sim card without any additional steps, besides the fact that it had to be converted into a microsim using my knife :) only one surprise when i got it - the phone came pre-configured for the german market, including language settings and some local bloatware. eventually it was not a problem, i just switched the language and removed the bloatware (most of it was removable). a few points worth mentioning: speed - i have had quite a few android devices, phones and tablets - this is the fastest and smoothest one by far. camera - i was very surprised with the speed of the camera and the quality of the pics. s-voice (siri equivalent) - pretty much worthless at this point .   contacts - i liked the additional options in the samsung version, such as merging various user profiles (facebook, google, skype etc) into one contact. sound - seems that the sound quality and max volume in the headphones are better than other devices i have/had. it has a barometer, it's nice to have, still trying to find uses for it .   it is pretty qualified phone. for me its screen is far beyond my expectations, flowers in the screen seem a real flowers. i used to use iphone 4s, the quality are similar, but one negative thing for this phone is that it is very light for me. overall this phone is as excellent as iphone 4s. after a few weeks using the phone i can say, that this is very nice, powerful and pretty. the motion gestures are very nice for lots os things very well thought. the eye monitoring is helpful, the battery takes 1 and a half day easily full usage for work, but it can take longer a full business day even if you are a maniac =). o celular ã© muito bom, mas nã£o sei porque veio com a linguagem em polones, nã£o sei se era um aparelho devolvido, pois a linguagem original deveria ser ingles .   the product isn't the one as described. actually the phone is the model at&t sgh-i747 instead of the international version i9300, as described! they are quite different, starting with different cpu, language possibles to work with, 3g vs. 4g ando so on .   hi, after waiting for a long time, i bought samsung galaxy s3 when the rate was below $600. i bought unlocked mobile without checking the model. (thinking that there is only one model). my intend was to buy quadcore processor but ended up buying dual core processor. when i enquired it, i learned that there are many models in s3 and i bought sgh-t999 which is dual core and locked mobile. mostly, mobile manufactured in china, seems to be not working correctly. looks like this product is not genuine if it is manufactured in china. hence i returned back the mobile. my suggestion is to buy this mobile after checking twice or thrice with the seller. there are lot of models of s3 out there in market. buy the correct one .   i own a galaxy nexus - the google phone - and love it. i'd give that one about 4.5 stars, but we are not talking about that phone. anyway, my wife needed a phone and was upgrading from the original droid that she hated and could never really figure out. i was tempted to get her another nexus, but figured i'd splurge and try this one out since it's the big thing right now. wow. what a great device. it does everything the nexus does, with a little more pizazz. my wife, who was afraid of the phone going in - she thought it would be too techy for her especially after her droid experience - absolutely loves it. right off she was figuring out things for herself and settling right in. now, i could quibble about the size of the phone. it's even bigger than the nexus, which i find a bit large. however, if you are buying the phone, i will assume you know how big it is. the large size makes it solid for texting and browsing, but it is noticeable in your pocket. still, the size is there for a reason. if you want a big screen, then you can't complain about the size, can you. the latest version of android has petty much closed the gap with ios. dead simple and very intuitive .   wow! this is complicated for a person who isn't up to date with technical qualifications. i love my galaxy and continue to fumble my way through. i've been taking lots of pictures it. handy not to carry a separate camera around. i wonder how to work the voice command .   the size of the screen is really nice and it's easy to use the keyboard. i have now set up my weather station for different areas and also have my e-mail coming in. i did set up with t-mobile as the phone instructed me .   really good phone. awesome freatures. will become even better on recieveing jelly bean update. huge screen, great support and awesome app from play store .   i got galaxy s3 as gift for my bro and he simply loved it :) :)  .   the phone is excellent as we all know and i got good deal on amazon compared to market value. the delivery was outstanding. i was able to track the product and it was delivered exactly on the date promised by the seller. only drawback i guess would be if you buy it from store you will be getting an extra battery along with mobile charger which wasn provided by the seller but then just for one extra battery you will be paying easily 200bucks more in shop. s3 in every way is the smartest and fastest phone with fun applications and amazingly user friendly. so if you thinking of buying a new phone go for it guys its worth the money :). i had a motorola atrix, then an iphone 4s but the galaxy s iii is the best! the camera is great and incredibly fast, the image is like the iphone 4s but bigger (screen 4,8), the syncronization with google is great and i love the widgets. in comparison with the iphone i can tell you that you need like 2 or 3 clicks less on every action you want to take. the screen is great but is a little bit bigger so i will prefer a phone not so big. thanks. the product is as advertised. i like the way the seller put a small note about how to change the language of the phone from german to english :) the only problem is the warranty which is really important to me and i expected them to fill out and sign the warranty card, because without date of purchase and signature of the dealer, the warranty is not valid (i think so). i couldn't find any way to contact the seller. that's why i finally mentioned the warranty issue here. everything else is perfect. the phone seems awesome (for one-day working) and the shipping was fast and on time. i'll update this review after working with the phone for a while. thanks, maysam. samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version: i own a galaxy s2 and switching my old sim card was a breeze. i bought the s iii for my wife and opened up the back to transfer her sim and realized that i needed a microsim card. did the normal on-line checks and found that a work-around was possible by cutting the old sim card. however, here is what you need to know: my mobile provider advised that my existing (normal) sim card (2009 vintage - 25mm x 16mm) was not sized to cut to the microsim size (15mm x 11mm) as the chip was too close to the latter dimension. for $3.49 they sold me the new style normal sim card (25mm x 16 mm) with the chip being much smaller than before (12mm x 9mm). the new sim card was 'activated' with my existing number and then cut with a cutter (like the clearmax micro sim cutter from amazon). with an adaptor, i transferred all my contacts to the microsim card and installed in the new s3 phone. phone in service. she loves it! maybe 4 stars as neither blutekusa, amazon nor samsung advised customers. recommend that amazon puts this advisory in their product description .   more than expected, great telephone, excelent interface, friendly, little expensive but it pay for it. size is not a problem when you use the internet .   el celular llego en buen estado, nuevo de paquete recomiendo al vendedor gracias, estoy disfrutando del celular .   no me arrepiento de la decision de comprarlo .   good phone goooooooooooooood v g v g v g v g v g vg vg phone so nice c c c c c c. i am very upset with this. this cellphone did not come with a battery or headphones. what is a cellphone without battery, and they haven't solved anything. what am i going to do with a cellphone with no battery .   im having great.time with this phone but one problem galaxy wont work good with soul by ludacris or any other headphones that good. other than that it is perfect. i like it. but somehow i need to get used to it. the battery is still a problem. i suggest samsung to solve this problem .   excelente telefono, procesador super rapido, facil de manejar, gran cantidad de apps diseã±adas para android entre otras, lo recomiendo plenamente, mauricio from ecuador. this is the most advanced smart phone thus far with most latest features. except that it is little bulky because of the screen size, everything else is excellent .   i'm not going to bore you with the many goodies this phone brings about. i'll just say that i'm pretty satisfied with the product, it is everything it's promised. the interface is fast and intuitive, even if you're not familiar with android devices. the only downside is the the finish on the body does look like plastic and not metallic, like it's shown in the pic and the widget for video player is a tad small for my taste. the device is surprisingly light, tho and it's a lot easier to handle with both hands. i haven't tried it with any games yet, i have yet to download a couple and see how it works but so far, so good. recommended .   to put it in one sentence - after demoing to a person they smile and ask - can i hold it for a minute. what i like. into a meeting put it on the table upside down and it is silent. pick it up - put into pocket and sound is on a again. camera and its features are beautifull. take repeat shots at something like 5 shots per second. switch from still to movie with one touch. the touch screen is the best i've seen. the gps has less feature but has a beautifull veiw and it is quick. also finds places by just town name. very freindly. don't like. - the sound button is oposite the on off button so too easy to down the sound by accident. it is expensive but worth every penny. rob south africa. galaxy s3 is nice phone. because galaxy s3 have a big screen! i'm japanese. so my english is bad .   but i'm sure, this seller(mr. bobby) is very nice man, and had good after service. galaxy s3ã¯æœ€é«˜ã®æºå¸¯ã§ã™ã€‚ã†ã¤ãã—ã„å¤§ããªãƒ‡ã‚£ã‚¹ãƒ—ãƒ¬ã‚¤ã«æ°´ã®ã‚ˆã†ãªãƒ‡ã‚¶ã‚¤ãƒ³ãœç´ æ™´ã‚‰ã—ã„ã§ã™ã€‚ãã‚œã«ã€å‡ºå“è€…ã®ãƒœãƒ“ãƒ¼ã•ã‚“ï¼ˆbobby)ã®ã‚µãƒ¼ãƒ“ã‚¹ã¨å¯¾å¿œã«ã¯ã€é©šãã»ã©è¦ªåˆ‡ã§ã™ã€‚æœ¬å½“ã«è²·ã„ã§ã™ï¼ï¼. its an excellent phone it came in time but in the review it never says that it is a french phone and that it came with aplications of the french carrier, also it cames with the european charger (they put an american charger converter so its a point for them). its a very good service and a very good divice. great phone love it and got the flip cover for it. easy to use and is really the hot item out there now when it comes to smart phones .   samsung galaxy s iii, it sleeps when you sleep, true this is a very powerful machine, its actually wealth its price. the seller packed the package as instructed which i should say was very impressive, if ever am to get another s3 am still going to get it from this seller. good doing business with you .   this my feedback claim related to this product: the positive: * great design / great operative system * i receive a sgh-t999 model with 1.5ghz processor dual core 1.5gh & 2 gb ram not a 4g lte device , but it very fast even it is not quad core * in addition you i receive 48gb free space for 2 years in drop box the negative: * no headphones included in the box * reliability: after full charging i start using it with no problems but for some reason the device does not power on randomly even if it has more than 70% battery. in order to wake the phone up i have to plug in the charger line a moment and then the phone is ok and i'm able to use again. this happens randomly, but i am losing my calls when the phone doesn't wake up. i been using the same operative system (android) in other devices more than a year for this reason i am sure something is going wrong (in my case the supplier is abe-123) * unlocked issues: the reason i search for unlock devices is because i am free to get full benefits from manufactured. this phone it's a t-mobile branded device for this reason it has a custom made operative system (ics) and not the original stock operative system from samsung and will never get officially updates (stock rom's) and it has function that i am not able to use in my country but consuming my resources (memory & processor). this is not really an unlocked device * notice that is not possible to move applications to the external memory like other devices (micro sdhc). so much for being unlocked and 'international' ( not sure how this would work in germany since tmobile is huge there, and the seller was german .   ) the frequencies that this phone provides are different from that of tmobile. so, if you intend to use this on the tmobile network, you need to buy a different galaxy s3 which has a different model number - this is what the person at the tmobile store said. if thats the case, i dont see the point in calling it unlocked, since the only big provider you have left is at&t .   i bought the pebble blue, unlocked international s3 eight months after i bought the same version of the s2 for my wife here in quito. she was very, very happy with her christmas present, and i rated it five stars. i'm pleased to say that the s3 is even better than the s2 (as well it should be!) and probably would rate higher than five stars, if that were possible to do here. i've used my s3 for a week now, and it works great in all functions, as a phone, and as internet instrument, via wi-fi and 3g. it's super fast, the ui is very fluid and responsive, and it's light with a large, well-lit screen. it's definitely a five-star product in my book! one last note: my wife is now negotiating with me to see if she can weasel my s3 out of me. should have seen that coming. oh well, maybe samsung will come out with a s4 for her next present .   this phone does not work with mac computers - connected via usb cable. the downloaded driver and other directions from samsung do not help at all. i am using os 10.8 and the phone has the latest android 4.0.4. i tried everything and looked on the web to correct the issue or work around it. no luck. without such connection it is difficult to load any music on the phone. moreover if your car has usb connector to your sound system, most likely connecting this phone will not work on it as well. it is really a shame because the phone is really sleek and nice, great responsiveness and good design. sorry but i am going to return the item and wait for iphone 5 which hopefully, will save me all this headache .   excelente telã©fono. tiene mejor sistema de ahorro de baterã­a. yo dirã­a que ahora dura casi el doble o casi el triple. la pantalla es mucho mã¡s grande. la resoluciã³n tambien. con la nueva versiã³n del sistema operativo, los programas tienen mã¡s opciones de configuraciã³n. es mucho mã¡s rã¡pido. es excelente en todo. lo ãºnico malo que yo considero es que debiã³ haber salido con al menos 1.5 gb de ram .   this is not a smart phone is the smart phone. i am sure that this review will only add to the countless positive review this phone already had .   just got my white s3 and i'm in love all over again (first time was with s1) .   the phone's screen is absolute beauty and watching movies on it is an experience you cant compare with any other cellular device. though i ordered the international version, i was surprised to get a polish one (was hoping to get the english one). not a big issue since the phone can be set for english and i anyways don't use the documentation that comes with it (that's in polish too). however the best part was that the phone came in 2 days earlier than expected .   all in all, very happy with the purchase and with the seller as well .   buy it, try it .  and u wont regret it .   i love this phone as an iphone user who has tried two other android phones and really hated them this has changed my mind! it has a seamless set up, is so easy to use, screen is amazing, i am not a this or that fight over my phone is better than your phone and still love my other but i adore the samsung galaxy s3, i am thrilled i bought this phone and the seller is fantastic! very happy with my new samsung galaxy s3 phone .   very fast and smooth, very well designed. i love its big screen. i had a sgsii but sgsiii is better so far it has many features that you will love .   hi, i have a simple question? wich version is this mobile you are offering? 1.5 or 1.4 .   dual- core? or quad-core .   are you sure? because in the descriptions it says that is a dualcore, and i need a quad core because i'll move to latin america, thanks. item came not only as described but better. i bought this device for my wife and she absolutely loves it! she inst a tech girl but i am definitely a tech guy .   so i know what she has and she definitely has the best of the best! the screen size is awesome! the resolution on it is bright and brilliant! anyone looking for something top of the line, this is it! does everything u want it to do. the only down side i can say is the battery life. but even so i still gave it a 5 star review ;) enjoy .   excelent product. it is a trully 5 star smartphone out of this galaxy! nice andas marvelous screen with a smooth ui and os. i loved the phone, but only had it for 6 days. as the screen broke. i have now been told that the screen is very sensitive. it would be great if it came with a cover. i did purchase a cover, but as yet i haven't received it. it has been a night mare trying to get it fixed and world wide distributors are the most un helpful, un co-oprative company i have ever come across. they took days to come back to me then refused to take my phone back as i no longer have the box. telling me to deal with samsung directly. i would never buy anything from them again. zena. moved to s3 from iphone4s and i am using the international version in att network and i still get the 4+ signal.no issues with it.the only issue i have is the place where the volume button and power button is placed. needs to hold in the lower portion of the phone .   it's a great phone much cheaper but with a lot more features than the carriers branded phone. galaxy s3 international! great deal great services! go 4 it  .   i had got my samsung galaxy s3 a month ago from amazon .  it was my first product to buy from amazon .  and bought it from seller stylevie  .  they packed and shipped it very carefully .   now about the product .  it was awesome phone to have .  some what like little computer .  lol screen : thanx to gorilla glass .  the scratches were not caught on screen atol .  but better to have a screen protecter and a good case to avoid any damage .  becoz i dropped it two times :p but nothing happened becoz of case :) touch: the touch was buttery smooth u'll njoy it .   camera: -the camera was also too good and take pictures very clearly and 1080p video quality was also excellent with continues auto focus (and can take good pictures while recording video). -the front camera also takes 720p video .   :d battery: it'll take around 2 1/2 (2.5 hrs)for fully charging from 0 to 100% .  and it will be run for about 14hrs with more usage and it lasts for a day by normal usage .  there was power saving mode option and u can increase its running time .   heating up: not at all, u see s3 doest heat soo much as it was heated in s2 .  if u use mobile for hours by playing games ,watching videos or browsing net there will be a very little heat at downpart of the phone software : as u know icecream sandwich was really excellent and running good on s3 and the jellybean update will be coming in a few months too .   connectivity : the bluetooth version is 4.0 which is very latest .  there is wi-fi .  u can connect to usb's using a usb on the go cable .  and u can also connect to specially designed keyboards , mouse , .  etc., performance : it is a quad core processor .   no lags atol and and it was smooth while scrolling even more than dozen of apps are running .   :d features: -it has many features like s-voice , s-beam , pop-up play etc., the s-voice was also good like apple's siri :) -the s-beam was also good  .  and i like very much the feature called pop up play .  u can pop up video that is playing and u can keep the video any where u want on the big screen.it was not laggy and was so smooth to move over the screen and can simultaneously can do texting browse net etc., -when we open video player u can see thumbnails playing a little preview of video and u can easily select the video u want :) -samsung touchwiz also very good :) -slide ur hand on screen and take screenshot -tap on top to move to top of the list u r scrolling , smart stay , direct call .  what can i say there were many features like these .   :d display : it was 720p resolution display which is very nice to view videos,while playing games etc., .  however in sunlight there will be little dissapointment .  but keeping the brightness to full u can see even bright light :) apps: u have tons of apps in google play store .  and the hd games which have more size also run very smooth .   :) storage: i have 16gb internal memory(11gb available for storage) which is enough :) but i bought another 32gb external memory card .  now my storage was huge(48gb) .   while installing apps .  app2sd was not working at present which is used to install apps to sd card so i loaded music videos and other stuff to sd card and installed apps on phone memory so that i can manage perfectly :) pocketability: the s3 was a big phone .its about 5 inch mobile  .  first i doubted whether it fits perfectly in my pocket .  when i kept my phone in pocket(jeans or normal) it fits perfectly .   the phone was thin and happily fits in pocket no worries :) finally i can say onething samsung galaxy s3 was an awesome phone to have and its a beast .   :d :). i finally got my siii and wow! it's all i expected it to be and more. i am doing stuff that i never thought would be done on a phone. i love it .   the phone was a replica of the original samsung galaxy s111 but the only problem is that it didn`t come with the original operrating manual so that people will read and understand its functions,also it didn`t work with t- mobile`s 4g network. muy buen telefono, lo recomiendo. ligero y potente. mejor que el iphone 5. tengo el blanco y el azul y son muy elegantes .   this device is awesome! no issues! probably only thing is i was so used to have the power button at the top .   and volume buttons are trending more to the middle of the device instead of closer to the top .   so when you put it in horizontal is easy to touch them unwillingly. but you can get used to it and it won't be a problem then. not as a big issue to remove a star for it. un muy buen equipo, exelente diseã±o, diseã±ado a la perfeccion, el color es bonito, lo recomiendo 100 cien por ciento. i love it! cant stop staring at it, the looks? men it awesome! slim and super light. you can do anything you want on s3! hd screen baby .   i love my galaxy s3. i travel all over the world and haven't have a problem with it yet. it took a little getting use to at first since i was a iphone 4 user but i with the bigger screen and faster processor i've already forgotten about my iphone .   awesome phone .   it is actually unlocked .  but .  why if it's factory unlocked it comes with deustche telekom (german t mobile) content on it .   this cellphone is kind of expensive. however it has lots of useful features. it has some cons, for example s voice does not work as well as you may think based on the ads. also the battery discharges to fast, in my case it does not even last a whole day .   the phone, with the european version, arrived as planned. sadly, during the use, it fell and the supposedly indestructible gorilla glass screen cracked completely. also, it's very slippery to grab on the hand. bottom line, i recommend to stick to sgs2. the phone have defective pixel and black spots on a dark background. then, i contacted a seller (fgs trading) and they ready to refund the purchase price, but not ready refund taxes and shipment (~300$) and they dont gave any solution to repair the phone. i contacted a samsung in israel, and they told me that is no international warranty at most of countries, include israel. now i regret that sold iphone 4 and got this shit .   update 5/03/2013: just read a post elsewhere where someone said android was only good for web,email, and stupid games. i chuckled to myself and replied .   seriously? i'm not saying android can do everything, but in the last three hours (while doing other stuff) i used my s3 to look up the current exchange rate for usd to gbp, updated an associate's excel spreadsheet to use the current exchange rate in several formulas, edited a professional four track audio file to delete an unneeded intro and shorten the song to the desired length and moved the key up two semitones and mixed it down to 2track stereo, then used it to drive from one part of caracas to another using real time traffic updates to avoid the fabled traffic jams, here. if all one wants to do is web, email and games, why buy an android product? +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ the unlocked international version that yapper provides is just what i was looking for. i'll talk first about the not-so-obvious reasons why this phone is the best in the world. i love traveling and can't imagine being stuck with a stupid us model that only works with one us provider. this phone works great with tmobile and att in the us, and all of the gsm providers that the rest of the world uses .   no roaming! battery life is way better than my iphone, but even better is the peace of mind you get with being able to swap out the battery with a fresh one if you can't get a charge for a couple of days. (yes, i can get a couple of days from the battery while the iphone can't even get one day!) the same usb cable you use to charge with is also the data cable that plugs right into the usb port of any computer (or tablet), allowing you to share files with the phone's memory or sd card. you can't do that with an iphone. of course, you can also swap out the sd card, giving you yet another way to share files with others or simply add storage .   can't do that with an iphone, either. i've only had this phone since mid june, but already i've helped out others several times by turning on the wifi hotspot feature that let them see my phone as a wifi hotspot and use my cell data connection for their laptops and tablets. these are a few of the not-so-obvious things this phone can do that others can't. the obvious things that make this phone the best include the big, beautiful screen, incredibly light weight and thinness, speed, buttery smoothness, availability of apps and no need for a computer or itunes! finally, a real life example. we were driving near seattle, trying to make three appointments in scattered locations that involved two ferry crossings (not realizing what that means in summer on a friday .  ) while i was driving, she was using the the gs3 to check the web for ferry schedules at different locations, get upates on wait times, comparing alternative drive times, making calls, finding the nearest gas, and getting driving directions to three places we had never been before. as friday traffic closed in around us (can you imagine how much traffic on a beautiful summer friday in the puget sound?) we were able to avoid overloaded ferries, drive our way into reverse commutes avoiding miles-long backups, circumnavigated puget sound and made all three appointments. at the end of the day as we rode the last ferry across puget sound, she looked at her unused iphone, put it in the glove compartment and said, "wow! that was amazing to use the gs3. i can't go back to using an iphone, now .   i couldn't have done all that in time." after a beat she chuckled and added, "just all the pinching and zooming would have driven me nuts!". samsung siii received, but i'm not satisfied with the product quality is not enough, the material is quite simple, i do not recommend. from amazon.com i bought, i returned to dislike the product, made ''of 15% deduction, have an unfair profit, while the returned product, be aware that when you cut .   i'm a very fan of technology and pretty much pass quite time on the computer checking what is new in the market and what technology has to offer me for new. recently a had a bad luck day, one of those when you scream why meeee .   lol but in the end it was supposed to happen and material things can be recovered so i'm over it as of right now. more because i had to replace my samsung galaxy note (tremendous phone btw .  ) because i lost it at the beach on that bad luck day. i checked the market and even i could buy my old note again i'm more like the type of guy that like to try new and better, so i decided for the samsung galaxy s3 even when i was losing the 4g capability on the sgn but i was totally gaining speed because of the quad core processor the new s3 come with. i'm totally thrilled with my new toy and i recommend it 100% as i do recommend the seller that made my life change when i got my phone. good experience i'm glad to share with all amazon community .   this phone is not compatible with a t-mobile sim card.(no 4g, will only perform at edge speeds) the description on amazon says the 4g is "region based" and since i live in new york, my "region" does pick up 4g. i dont think the average consumer knows the specs of the phone. now i'm being charged $65.00 just to return the phone (10%) plus shipping .   very disappointed .   i had bought this product by looking that its a factory unlocked but as i received the product it was taken in plan and later unlocked where i am unable to use certain applications like gps. i had loved the product but i felt i was falsely persuaded to buy this product .   i suggest you to b very careful and also beware of seller before buying too .  â samsung galaxy s iii / s3 unlocked gsm smart phone (pebble blue). excellent product, all i wanted, is the best phone that i ever bought. i had the galaxy ii and this is a very huge advance. is a good recomendation for any one that loves google, android, and samsumg .   awesome. can't keep it out of my hands. they thought of everything with this phone. what will samsung come up with next :-). es un excelente telã©fono, me encanta el diseã±o, en cuanto rendimiento es sãºper rã¡pido, el software estã¡ muy bien acabado, la interfaz grafica es muy buena, el s3 no calienta tanto como el s2, y le dura mã¡s la baterã­a. lo recomiendo mucho .   less than a minute from switch-on to ready-to-call. battery life is quite decent, but using gps drains it quite rapidly. s memo allows taking notes with your finger, which works out quite neatly, to my surprise. samsung is onto something here .   this phone is fantastic. it feel great in the hand and pocket, despite the immense screen size. the software is incredibly fast and smooth although the "ios rip off" crowd does have a case on a few of its features. regardless, the phone runs great, is very powerful and battery length is quite good due to the large battery (easily lasts 24 hours of light to moderate use). the bootloader is factory unlocked and works without issue on multiple sims on usa at&t. it is important to note, however, that the quad-core exynos chip will not support us lte bands so beware before you buy .   samsung galaxy s3 is an awesome phone and has really nice video quality .camera is superb the only problem i faced that it uses micro sim card instead of the normal sim card we generally use but thats easily resolvable .   when i opened the box yesterday to unwrap my 32 gb white s3,i discovered it was a romanian model, replete with romanian manual--no english. my international galaxy s2 was a british model, saving me the not-so-onerous task of downloading an english-language manual in pdf. i have to get a micro sim (only have needed a mini (what most of us think of as the usual sized sim for the last few years), i haven't tried out all the phone's features, but as far as i can tell, nothing is missing or different. short battery life, but i expect it to extend itself a little as i break in the phone. shipment and delivery went smoothly and phone arrived on time .   ordered the phone on friday and it arrived on monday. i had to wait until wednesday for the mini to micro sim cutter to arrive before i was able to use the phone on t-mobile network. i have purchased apple phones since iphone 3g was introduced but changed to samsung android phone last year. i have purchased both palm products and various windows mobile variants prior to apple os. i have purchased at least one, sometimes 2 phones every year since the early 90's both in usa and japan. i have purchased 8 smart phones since 2006. this is the first time purchasing a mobile phone from amazon. pros: i agree with most of the posted positive reviews so i will not repeat the great features of this phone. cons: 1. data speed on t-mobile network is edge, same speed as iphone 2g (2.5g technology; 200 kbps download and 100 kbps upload). if i use samsung phones sold in usa by t-mobile i can get >8 mbps download and >1 mbps upload at same locations. 2. gorilla glass 2 easily cracks. i have multiple cracks across the entire screen after dropping the phone from approximately 3 feet, less than a week old. touch screen and lcd is working fine but i must deal with very visible cracks. unfortunately the glass is fused to the display, and the display to the galaxy s iii's frame. i must purchase the entire display module including the glass, lcd, backlight, touch screen and the metal frame. the cost of this module is $300 plus shipping. i have dropped my previous phones many times (iphones and smaller size samsung phone) and never damaged the screen in the past. i may consider paying $7-$11 per month for insurance even with a $200 deductible for my next phone. i will most likely purchase a new phone from amazon with a contract (less than $150) and use my international unlocked phone with many cracks when i travel outside usa. 3. japanese language support still requires loading an application. apple os supported japanese and other languages since its introduction. single button in all applications to change language. i noticed korean language is supported with samsung keyboard .   everything published about this phone is right. but .   i was counting on the international tag to guarantee that i am going to have hebrew included. big disappointment, since even thou i downloaded an additional keyboard, i can't enjoy some of the fitures the galaxy offers .   okay, i was a bit skeptical when ordering this phone, for one i did not want to be ripped off buy the seller. overall i was just scared that i would be blowing $650.00 for the phone. i ordered the phone on the 9th of july 2012 and i received it on the 11th of july(express shipping of course) and i was so pleased with the delivery time, it got to me a day earlier. the phone is awesome. i was scared at first when my old sim car would not fit but thanks to the help of youtube you can cut down your sim card into a micro sim card (no guarantees) but luckily it did work. i contacted the seller and within 10 minutes i got a response.( i contacted the seller cause i could not get my sim card in the slot so i thought i got a bad phone but then i realised that is how the phone is made, just like the iphone 4s it requires a micro sim card which you should be able to get from your service provider.) so if you ever doubt ordering something so expensive. this review is for you it came neatly packed, with headphones, charger, manual and the phone of course. so far the phones performance has been spectacular, the s voice is incredibly amazing and much more improved from the galaxy s 2. the graphics is also very great. in terms of battery performance its okay for a phone that has high performance, but if you have a car charger and one at home you should be good to go. you wont regret it .   the gt-i9300 only has a 3g antenna just in case you were expecting 4g speeds. on wi-fi this phone out performs the domestic galaxy s3 but not by anything all that significant .   i ordered this phone a couple weeks ago as a gift for my boyfriend and i am quite happy. the package came on time and was exactly what it was supposed to be. and the phone, amazing! super-fast, ridiculously clean graphics and just overall awesome. i had a really hard time handing it over and am considering getting one myself. people have been labeling it the iphone killer. i wouldn't necessarily go that far as to say it kills the iphone but its certainly giving it a run for its money! definitely get this phone if you're considering it .   it's just awesome, amazing .   i don't have words to describe it .   the best phone ever! just be advise that you need a micro sim card to this phone. i cut mine using a miro sim card cutter .   es el mejor celular en la historia .   muy rapido y exelente hardware y android lo mejor por supuesto. samsung rompe record el mejor celular .   the product arrived in only 4 days, definitely i will be doing business again with fgs trading. . . . . . . .  .   first of all, i bought from wireless everything. i was very pleased with them, it came sealed and great customer service as well. well, i used have the htc evo 3d from sprint. which it was my first smartphone. i simply hated my evo 3d, dropping calls .   keep rebooting all the time, and not built in great materials. so, i canceled my plan with sprint (terrible signal in san diego), and i decide that i needed to have a great phone for the next couple years. samsung galaxy s3 seemed the right choice. i have to tell to you i have no regret about buying these handset for $699 .   good point is unlocked .   so you are free. the s3 is fast with exynos 4212 quad (cpu quad-core 1.4 ghz cortex-a9) plus the great camera .   also, the gt-i9300 doesn't have bloatware from the carriers, which you can't uninstall but only if you root. i have t-mobile now, valued plan. and i know i am getting edge 2g, which i was thinking if was a good call. so contact the t-mobile customer service. and i got really good news .   "t-mobile's network modernization. new equipment will be installed in 400 gsm/hspa+ sites by the end of june that will enable hspa+ in the 1900 mhz band. over 2,500 sites will have the new equipment installed by end of july. " from t-mobile specialist. which means you be getting 4g on the gt-i9300 very soon .   you don't need to ripped off by at&t! the reason that t-mobile are doing this only now, because at&t failed to buy t-mobile not being approved by the government. t-mobile wouldn't spend a penny .   at that time they were going to use the at&t system. so, now t-mobile doesn't want to stay behind by the rivals. which is great. which means t-mobile will announce the iphone as well working on 1900 mhz band. i am sure that s3 will be working amazingly fast very on t-mobile. great phone! great to keep for a lot of years for sure .   i used to own a galaxy s2 and since it was excellent i decided to buy the s3 which is more than excellent. this is the quadcore version which works perfect. i would like to say more, but i think that a video in youtube is better to describe how excellent is this phone. about the battery, it is alsmot 50% better than the galaxy s2. apple has nothing to do against this one because the s3 is very focused in sharing (info, pics, music, etc etc etc) and on the other hand, the mentality of apple is anti-sharing .   this is my first android phone and i've only had it 36 hours .   i ordered the samsung i9300 and was very concerned about how i would get the phone up and running with less time than my last unlocked phone. as with all unlocked phones, internet and mms require manual setup when not locked to a carrier. took me two days on a weekend to figure the settings out with my previous unlocked phone, sony ericcson satio. this seller included instructions on how to change the language and set up a new apn. i was up and running after 5 minutes (not including phone charging time, of course). two thumbs up for including the settings. packaging was very complete and as promised, new. never been opened. i went to the at&t store to purchase a case and all of the reps there were just drooling over this phone. the weight, the color (pebble blue), the graphics, the response to touch. definitely worth the price. all-in-all i would recommend this seller, products and shipper (fullfilled by amazon). everything went very smoothly and i am a very happy customer .   first foray into ics - never going back to ios. this phone is awesome. size can be a bit unwieldy, but it is fast, fast, fast .   i bought this phone from wire4less since it had good reviews:â samsung galaxy s iii/s3 gt-i9300 factory unlocked phone - international version (pebble blue) phone was delivered on time and it is great but is not prepared to resist a simple fall when you fail to put it in your pocket. i got it on tuesday and 2 days after i dropped it when putting it back in my pocket. a 3 feet fall (tops) was enough to get the plastic that covers the lens of the main camera (rear) completely smashed making the camera useless given the lens sees through a smashed plastic now. i can't believe a u$s 700 phone can take a simple fall so i want to think my unit is faulty and not built properly. i was obviously looking for a case for this phone but couldn't find one in any store so far. i just saw the flip case now in amazon but is too late. i contacted the seller to get an answer on this and they don't want to replace it or refund me given samsung is not going to cover it. given it is an international version, samsung us is not doing a thing and just tell me to contact amazon customer service or go to a carrier store and ask there. i looked for rear camera replacement online and i could only find it in ebay uk for about u$k 40. if you ask me, this is a great phone, great camera, screen and features but it is just inacceptable to have such a fragile thing. please take this into account before you decide to buy it and, of course, get a case with it from the very beginning. i hope wire4less, amazon or samsung do something about this .   before i ordered the sgs3 i owned a sgs2 what is really great. but the sgs3 seems to beat the band. it is much better as expected. more comfortable, bigger and clearer screen and .  just smarter. it's too much of paean to tribute to this phone, i would burst this place here. you can't make anything wrong buying this phone. but the price .  will come down with time. and watch for your warranty! i have got no certificate for a guaranty! (i hope, i never need). s3 is a very advanced mobile phone. i bought from wire4less, the only thing im not quite satisfied is there is the boe wasnt sealed, which makes me think it might a second hand or returned item .   i've never had any android device and at first i was a little apprehensive, coming from a blackberry the difference is noticeable. i'm very happy, tons of apps, low price, no exclusivity problems (like the nokia lumia 900 or iphone). i had the opportunity to handle an iphone for quite some time and i really don't get why people like it that much, this phone is way better, has a lot of functions and a real screen. i absolutely recommend it. and regarding the other review, probably that moron is installing the sim card backwards, the phone is fully unlocked and operational .   this phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, but is not, i have tried with 3 different simcard and still getting the no sim message . until last year, the previous couple of iterations in the galaxy s lineup were pretty predictable . they were all plastic bodied phones with removable batteries and memory . then last year, they took the galaxy s line in a new direction . the gs6 had an all glass and metal body and they did away with the user changeable battery and microsd . the last change struck a chord with users because you had to decide how much storage you’d ever need when you bought the phone plus you’d have to pay an inflated price if you needed more than the base model - just like you do with an iphone . fortunately, the microsd is back with the latest version along with water resistance - a feature which took a hiatus last year . otherwise, the gs7 is an evolution of the gs6 . the look follows samsung’s latest design language, the camera has been improved, you get a more powerful processor a bigger battery . that sort of thing . is it worth the upgrade . what about the samsung galaxy s7 edge? the edge is very similar to the non-edge gs7 with 3 main differences; the edge has a larger 5 . 5” curved display . while the display is quite a bit bigger, the edge is almost the same size as the regular gs7 . secondly, despite being about the same size, only a tad taller, the edge packs a huge 3600mah which is really impressive . lastly, the edge sports a higher price tag . aside from looking cool, to be blunt i don’t find that a phone with curved screen really makes it any better than a one with a flat screen . in fact, i think the curved edges make the phone harder to use because it’s difficult to hold the phone without pressing the screen accidentally . it also causes everything to be distorted with shifted colors at the sides . get the edge if you want the larger battery . otherwise save your money and get the regular gs7 . what about the huawei nexus 6p . while the difference in screen sizes doesn’t make them direct competitors, the first phone that popped into my head when i thought of the gs7 (besides the gs7 edge, lg g5 and htc 10, which i haven’t tried yet) was the nexus 6p . the 6p lacks the gs7’s 4gb of ram, optical image stabilization, microsd slot and water resistance . it also a slightly more modest snapdragon 810 soc and a dimmer screen . that said, it counters with a bigger screen, a better fingerprint reader and better sounding stereo speakers . another upside to the 6p that you can’t see on a spec sheet is that it’s easier to use . the gs7 is just too sculpted for my tastes . i find myself constantly touching the screen or menu buttons by accident - it really needs a thick case to be usable . then there’s the price, the gs7 is an extra $200 over the huawei . unless you need the water resistance (somewhat useful), optical image stabilization (must-have if you take video), 4gb of ram (no real world advantage over 3gb), microsd (you can spec the 6p with 128gb direct from google), i think you’re better off pocketing the difference and getting the 6p . while the screen size hasn’t changed, the gs7’s body resembles the note 5 rather than last year’s gs6 . that means the sides of the back are curved which gives it a more organic shape . i’m torn about the organic shape . on one hand, it does look pretty sleek and cool . on the other, it makes the gs7 much harder to use with one hand . no matter how i hold it, i’m almost always accidentally touching part of the screen or menu buttons . typing with one hand is difficult, games are interrupted when i accidentally hit the back button, ditto for when i’m watching long videos . hitting the shutter button when i’m taking a picture usually doesn’t work because part of my palm is touching the bottom right of the screen . yeah, a lot of it is due to how i hold the gs7, instead of cradling it loosely in your hand i prefer a kung fu/death grip because i don’t want to drop it accidentally . holding it very tightly also allows me to be  . still, the slim shape means the gs7 is still very compact even if you throw it in a case which is what i recommend you do if you pick one up . a case should mitigate the problem i mentioned . samsung also includes some software to make one-handed usage more easily but it involves making the screen smaller . i do like how you can activate this feature by triple tapping the home button but who wants to use a smaller version of the screen . the body which is metal sandwiched by glass in the front and back is very solid . while it’s a pricey phone, it definitely feels like a very expensive phone . the buttons stick out the perfect amount . i wish they clicked a little more when you pressed them in but this is probably a result of the water resistance . the home button doubles as a fingerprint reader . it has grown a little bit which you’d think would make it easier to use but in fact, i found that the fingerprint reader was much pickier than the gs6’s . a lot of the time it wouldn’t recognize my thumb and yes, i tried training it a second time making sure that it learned every part of my thumb . it’s quite a bit worse than the reader on the huawei nexus 6p . they’ve trimmed down the camera bulge a little bit . while it’s not flush, this should help it sit a little nicer if you place it on a flat surface and don’t have a case . the biggest change is that samsung has brought water resistance back . unlike the gs5, you don’t have to worry about closing the usb port because the gs7’s is sealed from the inside . i guess while the gs7 lacks a removable battery like the gs5, it also means you don’t need to worry about close the battery cover to ensure water resistance . of course, while the glass and metal body is very classy, it probably isn’t going to like being dropped too much . if you get a gs7 solely for the water resistant, remember that all bets are off if you drop it . if you plan on getting it wet and manhandling it from time to time make sure you also stick it in a rugged case . speaking of the usb port, samsung has stuck with microusb instead of a type-c . to be honest at this point i think type-c is more bad than good . think about it, microusb has been around for so long, many people already have a charging infrastructure in place to handle it . type-c is still quite new so chances are, you’ll have more microusb than type-c devices .  . yeah, microusb only fits in one way but having to handle two types of connectors (or 3 if you include apple’s lightning) is a bit of a pain at this point . type-c also supports very fast charging but the gs7 can actually handle 15 watts through it’s microusb which is comparable . another welcome change is that samsung brought the microsd support back . as is becoming more common, the nanosim sled has an extra space for the microsd . display: . you get a 5 . 1” 2560x1440 superamoled display . as is now the norm for flagships, the gs7’s display is very sharp, with extreme viewing angles and nice colour . out of the box, the colour is a tad too intense but you can change this in the settings so that it’s very natural looking . since this is an amoled display you get inky blacks that don’t glow when you look at the phone at night . while most flagships now come with awesome displays, the gs7 manages to distinguish itself by having one of the brightest displays around .  . generally speaking, amoled screens tend to be slightly less bright than lcd’s . i’m guessing two reasons for this are because amoled screens can draw a lot of power when they’re displaying white plus they are susceptible to screen burn in (yes, i’ve seen it happen) . anyways, the gs7 at maximum brightness is more or less as bright as the 6s plus when it’s maxed out . the gs7 at around 60% brightness is similar to the 6p at 100% . it’s that bright . the reason you want a bright amoled display is because they’re susceptible to washing out outdoors in direct sunlight . and in case you’re wondering, there actually is a noticeable difference between the 6p and the gs7 when you’re outside .  . the only bad thing i have to say about the gs7 display is that it’s bluish when you’re not viewing it straight on . it doesn’t sound like a big deal but i found myself spending a lot of time looking at it from slightly off-center and i do find the blue to be quite distracting . to be fair, every amoled phone i’ve played with lately has this problem . when you’re not using it the screen displays the time, date and battery unless something is covering the sensor like when it’s in your pocket . since the gs7 has an amoled, this has a very minimal effect on battery life . it’s also not super bright so it won’t cause burn-in . camera: . samsung has actually downsized the megapixel count on the gs7 from 16mp to a still very usable 12, just like the nexus 6p and iphone 6s plus . that way there’s still enough resolution to record 4k video . well the resolution is more or less identical, the 3 phones i mentioned all have very different cameras . the nexus 6p has the largest sensor of the 3 but it’s lack of optical image stabilization and if i’m honest, lousy camera software hold it back . the iphone 6s plus has very good camera software, image stabilization so while it lacks the 6p’s sensor size, it usually ends up taking better pictures even though the 6p has a more capable sensor . the gs7’s sensor size slots in between the 6p and 6s plus . it has optical image stabilization like the apple . its trick is that all of its pixels are capable of phase detection . basically, it focuses very quickly - even in very low light . if you turn the lights down and compare all 3 phones, the gs7 focuses like it was outdoors while the other 2 are desperately focusing in and out trying to find critical focus . the camera software has a lot of features but it’s also relatively easy to use . it’s has a very capable camera . i have young kids and the fast focus and high quality sensor means it captures a lot of keepers - like the 6s plus . looking more closely i thought that while the samsung has a better sensor with slightly less noise and greater dynamic range, it tends to really sharpen pictures a lot and over-saturate colours just a tad . low light video looks good on the screen but if you watch it on a larger screen you’ll notice that it does an enormous amount of noise reduction to the point that video lacks fine detail . it also does a lot of brightening so that it looks like it has a lot of dynamic range . as is now normal for android flagships the gs7 has a comprehensive manual mode complete with: . manual focus . white balance with 100 degree kelvin settings . iso . shutter speed . exposure . multi/center weighted focusing . raw setting . the fact that it's water resistant is just gravy . mind you, when the gs7 is submerged sometimes the water can cause the screen to do funny things because it can trick it into thinking something is touching it . anyways, you can use the volume buttons to snap a picture if you need to . the front-facing camera has a really wide angle which is great if you want to take selfies with a group of friends . the downside is that it’s not that great if you’re just taking selfies of yourself because the wide angle causes perspective distortion . you know the saying “the camera adds 10 pounds”? this is exactly what it does . software: . out of the box you get android 6 . 0 . 1 - the same version you’ll find on my nexus 6p . if you’re concerned about updates samsung generally makes you wait for new versions, as your phone gets older you’ll generally have to wait longer and longer for updates . expect around 2 years of updates and maybe a 3rd if you’re lucky . if you’re using a variant of a popular phone then all bets are off and there’s a good chance you won’t get any major updates unless you learn to flash the phone yourself . samsung ships with gs7 with their touchwiz overlay . to be honest, overlays where important when the original galaxy s ii came out, starting with the gs3 or 4 overlays began more and more superfluous and these days, aside from a custom camera, text messaging client and maybe an email client, app overlays in general don’t contain anything terribly useful . touchwiz comes with s-voice, their own web browser and their own app store . why would you bother with those when android phones come with google now, chrome and google play . to their credit samsung has been slowly paring back the duplicate apps by making some of them like chat-on optional downloads . then again, you need a custom app for some of the goofy samsung extras like the heart rate sensor which i doubt anyone uses . one new feature they’ve added is their game launcher . when you play a game there’s this icon that appears on top of your game . don’t worry, you can move the icon around . anyways, when you tap it it has shortcuts to allow you to: . disable alerts while you play . lock the back and app switcher keys . minimize the game . take a screenshot . record the game play . being able to disable the back and app switcher is nice since it’s really easy to press them by accident . then again, if samsung had designed the gs7 better you wouldn’t need this feature . if you don’t think this feature is useful you can always disable it . migrating to a new phone can sometimes be tricky so samsung includes a usb otg connector in the box . basically, it allows you to connect other phones to the gs7 like you would a computer so it can grab the information off of it like that . after you're done migrating you can also use it to connect mice, keyboards, usb drives, etc . performance: . 2015 was an interesting year when it comes to android flagship performance . everyone used a snapdragon 808 or 810 while samsung used their own exynos 7 octa 7420 . all 3 soc’s were released in early 2015 but unlike previous years, there was no follow up later in the year . in benchmarks the exynos was a tad faster than the 810 but practically speaking, there was little real world difference between these when it comes to performance . the difference was that while neither chip ran cool, the 810 ran hot enough to mean that it could rarely run at full speed . anyways, it’s 2016 and once again it looks like samsung will be using their own exynos 8890 while everyone else will be using the 810’s bigger brother, the snapdragon 820 . interestingly, us gs7’s will also be using the snapdragon 820 because us models need support for cdma . what’s interesting about the exynos in the gs7 is that it isn’t that affected by the temperature . while i was running antutu i thought i’d see if cooling it would increase its score . i filled a mug with ice water while i ran some tests . next i drained a sink and filled it with fairly warm water and it actually got the same score! i’m impressed . benchmarks are impressive with a noticeable improvement over 2015’s flagships . the gs7 is generally half a step ahead of the 6p when you’re doing things like loading games/apps and switching between them . that said, you probably won’t notice the difference unless you have them side-by-side . i guess the bigger difference between the 2 is the gs7’s ability to stay cooler when you’re running intensive tasks and graphics performance . however, the difference in graphics is only noticeable when you’re running something which really stresses the gpu . as a phone: . earpiece and speakerphone volume are both excellent .  . rf performance is above average . despite the gs7’s extremely sculpted shape, samsung managed to cram a 3000mah battery into the gs7 which is very impressive . i ran netflix for an hour with default brightness and maximum volume and the battery only ran down 9% which is very impressive: . media capabilities: . there’s a single speaker on the bottom . it’s relatively loud and very tuned sounded so there’s quite a bit of bass . it’s not quite as powerful as the nexus 6p’s stereo speakers but it’s still one of the better ones on the market . the microsd slot is back on the gs6 . it shares the same sled as the nano sim slot . so you don’t need to bother with a 64 or 128gb variant . just pick up a microsd if you need more space . conclusion: . the gs6 is a pretty decent phone so i was skeptical of how much samsung could improve the gs7 but as it turns out, it’s actually a noticeable improvement in many areas . the microsd and water resistance are pretty easy to understand but to me, the thing i was most impressed with is that they managed to put a battery that has 20% more capacity in a phone that’s roughly the same size . the camera’s focusing speed is also pretty impressive . that said, the gs7 is an android phone so there are plenty of competitors available now or soon which will probably be more affordable and offer comparable specs . samsung’s not the kind of company that believes less is more . their strategy is to saturate the market at pretty much all price points often times with multiple overlapping models . the samsung galaxy a5 was released in canada recently . looking at the spec sheet, highlights include a 5” 1280x720 display, 13 megapixel camera, a snapdragon 410 processor and 2gb of ram . the biggest feature however is the metal frame which makes it very solid . please note that even though it was released in canada in late 2015, this is the 2014 version of the a5, the sm-a500w . while there are many competitors, 4 big ones come to mind; the zte grand x 2, motorola’s moto x play, the zte axon and the oneplus x . what about the zte grand x 2 . off the top of my head, the zte has similar specs; 5” hd display, snapdragon 410, 16gb storage and a similarly sized battery . the kicker is that the zte actually has more ram, 2 vs 1 . 5gb, a more recent version of android and only costs $150 on prepaid or almost ? the cost of the samsung . so what do you get when you nearly 3x as much for the a5 . first off, you get a slick aluminum body . if you held the 2 phones, one in each hand there’s no doubt which one you’d think would cost more . the a5’s camera is also better and has a better screen . so while the a5 is arguably a more well rounded device, you’re paying an awful lot more for a device with such a modest processor . vs motorola moto x play: . for the same money, you can pick up a moto x play . the play has a larger, higher resolution display which is noticeably sharper and cleaner looking . it also comes with 2gb of ram which is rapidly becoming the new 1gb (industry standard) vs the a5’s stingy 1 . 5gb, a newer version of android and a more powerful snapdragon 615 soc . however, the play’s piece du resistance is it’s huge 3630mah battery which is about 50% larger than the a5’s . the a5 counters with a nicer metal body though the play’s isn’t too shabby either . between the 2, the play is the easier choice . what about the zte axon . another $400 phone is the zte axon . it has the a5 completely out-spec’d; bigger, higher resolution display, more ram, newer version of android, a snapdragon 801 and double the storage . heck, it even has a metal back; the a5 only has metal on the sides . with all that said, the axon’s camera is pretty awful as is the speaker . still, the axon provides way more value . what about the oneplus x . the other headache is that you can pick up the oneplus x for similar money . like the axon, it also comes with a snapdragon 801 which is backed with a generous 3gb ram . it also comes with a metal frame and a glass back . specs: . 5” super amoled display . body: . you get a slick metal frame with a plastic back . it’s a budget phone with expensive clothes . the edges are chamfered edge like the galaxy alpha/note 5 . i like how they ditched the alpha’s corner bulges . while it make the a5’s body less interesting, it makes it much more comfortable to hold . the buttons are all quite good . they stick just enough and click nicely when you press them in . they also don’t wobble when you half press them . the only downside to the a5 body is the plastic back . it’s not glass like many other recent samsung phones . display: . you get a 5” 1280x720 super amoled display . colour is pleasing with deep blacks and excellent viewing angles . it’s also very bright . the only problem is that it only has 1280x720 resolution . 1280x720 on a 5” lcd display looks passable but on an amoled display, it’s a bit gritty looking . many recent amoled displays have their sub pixels arranged in a pentile matrix . at super high ppi’s, you won’t notice it but at the a5’s more modest 290 you can see dots quite clearly . it’s kind of distracting to look at when you hold the a5 close . while the display has good fundamentals (color, blacks, viewing angles, brightness), in 2016, a $400 android phone has no business having such a grainy looking display . camera: . i don’t the camera app . it gives you a respectable amount of control without being too cluttered . there’s no manual mode  . picture quality is passable . you won’t get a lot of keepers in doors but it does alright for static subjects . video resolution tops out at 1920x1080 . software: . my a5 came with android 5 . 0 . 2 which is a bit of a disappointment since most newer phone ship with 5 . 1 or 6 already . i guess the type of person who spends a5 money in 2016 on a snapdragon 410 phone isn’t going to be too bothered with just 5 . 0 . it’s anyone’s guess if the a5 will receive major updates from samsung . it comes with samsung’s touchwiz overlay which duplicates a lot of the apps already built into android like a second browser, gallery, music player, video player and their mostly superfluous samsung app store . to be fair, some of the stock android apps are polarizing choices - it usually takes google a few years to get things right so there’s still room for some duplication . the best example is the camera app - with few exceptions oem camera apps are always better than the google one . it also includes a few extra utilities in case like a file manager, photo editor in case which i suppose saves you a trip to to google play to download your own . performance: . under the hood, you get a snapdragon 410 soc . you typically find 410’s on fancier entry level phones like the zte grand x 2 or moto g 3 . it’s a perfectly adequate processor for a $200 phone like the zte grand x 2 but in a $400 phone, it’s a bit of a shock .  . for $400, i would expect a snapdragon 615 (moto x play) at the very least or maybe even a powerful 801 (axon, oneplus x) . as such, the a5 is probably the slowest $400 phone you’ll find . for basic tasks, the 410 is fine but you’ll notice that apps take longer to load with more stuttering and skipping than you should at this price point . as a phone: . the earpiece and speakerphone are both quite powerful . there’s a volume boost feature in case you need it . rf performance is also quite good . the a5 isn’t really aimed at power users so it’s 2300mah battery should be adequate for most users . media capabilities: . you get 16gb of storage, if that's not enough you can add a microsd . the built-in speaker is quite powerful but it has a really narrow range so it sounds tinny with no bass at all . conclusion: . in the end, the a5 is an entry-level phone with the body of a flagship phone . it’s like a hotdog served with a side of caviar, an armani blazer with a pair jeans that have a hole in the seat . while there's nothing wrong with these pairings but they’re somewhat unbalanced . still, if you can appreciate the exterior and don’t have great processing needs the a5 could be an interesting choice . here’s my review of microsoft’s lumia 950 . i’ll be honest, i normally carry an iphone (6s plus) and some sort of android device (lately a lg g4 or nexus 6p) around with me . i only play with windows phones when i have a unit that i’m reviewing . this will help you understand the type of shades i’m wearing when i look at a windows phone - you'll understand where i’m coming from . with that in mind, the last windows phones to cross my desk were the lumia 830 and some blu units so it’s been awhile since one has graced my pockets . sure, i love my windows powered computers and laptops with all my heart but when it comes to their phones, i’m not invested at all in the windows phone eco-system . i guess i have 3 problems with windows phone (now called windows 10 mobile) . first off, as a parent with young kids, i’ve never been fond on the cameras on windows phone . sure, there have been some great ones like the lumia 1020 and the camera button is always handy but the app just stinks because it’s just too damn slow . the way i see it, since camera phone sensors are inherently inferior to larger ones, they have to make up for it with speed and the ability to shoot in bunches so that you can increase your chances for a keeper . secondly, while windows phone usually has the most popular, top tier apps, once you get past that, the app selection is still very thin . sure, they’ve sold zillions of windows phone but you’d never know that if you try to look for a game that’s not candy crush or an older version of angry birds . on the app front, it feels like there is no momentum at all . if you buy a new companion device, like a connected power switch or a smart thermostat or network connected camera, there’s a really good chance that there is no app for it on windows phone . microsoft is doing their best to fix this by making it easier for android and ios developers to bring their apps to windows phone but this isn’t going to fix this situation . thirdly, i’m just not fond of the operating system itself . i mean it works alright but in the end the workflow doesn’t feel as efficient as it is on ios and android . task switching is usually slower, killing apps is less intuitive, that sort of thing . when i use windows phone, it feels like i’m trying to do microsoft a solid, rather than using it because i want to . on to the review . vs lg g4: . to me, the closest competitor to the 950 is the lg g4 . it sports very similar specs but it runs android . both have qualcomm snapdragon 808 soc with 3gb of ram, 32gb of storage, 2560x1440 displays and removable 3000mah batteries . looking more closely the g4 has a slightly larger, curved 5 . 5” screen while the 950 counters with a few more megapixels on the rear camera . the problem with the 950 is that it was released around 6 months after the g4 came out plus the 950 is more expensive . add to that the android vs windows phone thing . i won’t take sides here so i guess if you really need a windows phone then i’d pick it over the g4 . otherwise the g4 is an easier choice . body: . when i inserted a sim card, i was disappointed because it it reminded me of a blu phone . it has a matte poly carbonate back cover with a flimsy body with a shiny plastic bezel - just like the blu win hd lte i reviewed a while ago . if you took the ms logo off, i’d swear it’s blu’s newest phone . the green phone is the win hd lte . don’t get me wrong, blu makes great phones when you consider that they typically cost around $100 but on a $650 phone, it’s completely unacceptable . i mean i’m ecstatic that the 950 has a removable battery and memory card slot but you really pay for this feature in other ways . what annoys me further is that the last microsoft phone i tried was the lumia 830 . the 830 comes with a slick metal body . does this mean that nokia’s influence is truly gone . all the buttons are located on the right side, from top to bottom it goes volume, power and camera . i dunno about you but they’re all flat and chromed which makes them look kind of cheap . i mean i get that the 950 is a minimalist looking phone but they could have included some surprises with the buttons . the buttons themselves have a nice click but they’re kind of vague feeling until you actually press them all the way in . there is a usb type-c connector at the bottom . while not common yet, usb-c is probably going to ubiquitous on phones and other devices in about a year . i do like how microsoft includes both a usb type c to regular usb cable along with a separate charger that has a type-c connector . while type-c is going to be common, ‘regular’ usb ports are probably still going to be around for a few more years . also, chances are none of your devices have a c port . one feature which i’m surprised is missing from the 950 is a fingerprint reader, iphones have had readers for 3 generations now, samsung has had it for 2 and it’s becoming common on android . this is one of the few ‘new’ features which is actually really useful and microsoft should have included it . heck, they could have taken it further and made it so you can unlock your windows 10 pc using your phone’s fingerprint reader . maybe next time . display: . you get a 5 . 2”, 2560x1440 amoled display . i compared it with the amoled display on the nexus 6p and the 950’s lags in a number of areas . first off, i’m not sure i’ve ever used an amoled display that looks slightly washed out .  . it also exhibits more color shift than similar displays . in terms of brightness it lags behind competitors . at max brightness it’s similar to an iphone 6s plus at 60% . don't forget that oled screens typically need a lot of brightness to work outdoors when its sunny . i’ll be honest, amoled displays have gotten so good lately that i’m a little caught off guard by the 950’s which while not terrible, isn’t all that great . camera: . there’s a 20 megapixel camera on the back with optical image stabilization and impressive looking 3 led flash . there is a side mounted camera shutter button . it’s a nice feature to have though a bit of a vestigial feature now that you can launch the camera on android by double tapping the home button . i will say though that the camera launches much faster than it does on any other windows phone that i’ve tried . you press the button and the app launches instantly . it doesn’t launch quite as fast as the iphone 6s/nexus 6p/galaxy s6 but i didn’t really notice this until i had them all side-by-side . i don’t know about you but when it comes to camera phones i’m all about speed . while the 950 launches quickly, by default the camera is rather slow because it tries to do stuff like shoot video and at the same time when you shoot pictures as is the style these days . htc was first to do it several years ago with their oddly named zoe feature, then apple copied them and now microsoft has too . this slows down the shot-to-shot speeds enough that i recommend you turn this feature off . by default, it also tries to fix up your pictures after you’ve snapped and before you view them . it causes an annoying pause if you try to view a couple of them .  . as for the app itself, i actually like the interface . it’s clean and fairly efficient . considering how minimalist windows phone can be, there are an awful lot of options for picture and video resolution . i mean it’s nice that there are you can choose between x, x etc resolutions, but having this many is confusing and slows thing down . image quality is not bad . i tested it mostly under low-light (indoors at night time) . it captures a bit more noise than the iphone 6s plus and the nexus 6p but the noise reduction is quite reasonable . it doesn’t really capture much more detail . color on the other hand is a mixed bag .  . i suspect the 950 does too much post-processing because colours are extremely over-saturated . reds, blues, greens all pop too much and look unnatural . there is a raw mode which captures jpg + dng . it’s not that much slower but it’s slow enough that i didn’t really use it . video image quality is mixed . it can be good but often times it loses focus plus picture can be soft at times . the microphone is excellent . software: . you get windows mobile 10 out of the box . if you have an older windows phone, you’re probably wondering why yours hasn’t gotten 10 yet . i think there are 2 reasons; first off, 10 is buggy on the 950 (more on that later) . secondly, even though microsoft exercises more control over windows mobile, i’m guessing carriers, plus the fact that they focus more on the desktop/server side means, getting all updates out at the same time isn’t as high a priority . but that’s just conjecture . one of the most interesting features of the 950 is the new continuum feature . it allows you to connect the 950 to a tv using an optional display dock or via wireless display . connecting your phone is nothing new, you’ve been able to connect a phone to a tv for at least 10 years now .  . what’s different about the 950 is that it displays ‘big screen’ versions of some apps when you’re using continuum . when you use it, the screen looks like a windows 10 pc . instead of viewing a larger version of what you see on your phone, it feels like you’re sitting in front of a computer . note how the start menu is identical to your phone's - that's cool . if you browse the web, you’d swear you’re using a ‘real’ computer . that said, anything that requires a plugin probably won’t work . it’s also good if you’re working on microsoft office . another thing that you can do your messaging from a bigger screen . the idea reminds me of the motorola atrix from 5 or 6 years ago . it let you attach it to the back of a laptop-ish looking dock . the 950 differs in that when you use continuum, you’re actually accessing the information from the 950 instead of a separate hidden computer like on the atrix . you can connect a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to the 950 . if you don’t have those then the 950’s screen doubles as a trackpad and keyboard . continuum only works with certain apps . if you look closely at my screen certain apps are grayed out . those one's don't support continuum . my guess is there isn't going to be a lot of apps that support it . it looks like a really well thought out idea, but in practice, it’s less useful than it looks . you see, wireless display has a bit of a lag to it . it’s perfectly fine if you’re just watching a video but if you want to interact with something, the lag makes it very frustrating - especially if you’re typing or moving a mouse . you use the mouse and then have to wait for the pointer to move . it’s very intuitive . i should also point out that i only have one official wireless display enabled device - a tv with a belkin miracast dongle . it could be that newer wireless display equipment has less lag . for what it’s worth i also have a roku which has wireless display as a beta feature . this has a lot less lag but it only works at a very low resolution which probably explains why it’s faster . it’s probably a lot better with a wired display dock but let’s be serious, if you have to physically connect your phone to something, chances are you’re never going to use it .  . the only times i really want get off my phone and move over to a ‘real’ computer are when i’m doing something that requires resources my phone doesn’t have like downloading large files, complex video editing, that sort of thing . then again, if your idea of ‘real’ computing is using a chromebook or chromebase then it could be a tantalizing view on what’s coming . just think, you could consolidate your computer and your phone into one device . then again, cloud computing kind of makes this idea obsolete . i hate to say it because it’s a really cool idea that really leverages microsoft’s strengths but continuum really looks like one of those features that looks good in advertisements that most people aren’t going to use . i guess it’s also a bit ahead of its time . ironically, windows phone’s “modern” ui with its solid blocks was starting to get dated so while 10 keeps the blocks, they now display your background so they’re a lot more friendly looking . unfortunately, what really stood out to me about the 950’s software can’t be found on the spec sheets or marketing materials . my time with the 950 was plagued by strange bugs . for example, i wanted to snap a video of my 2 kids playing . simple enough, but i just couldn’t do it because every time i pressed record nothing would happen and the phone would become unresponsive . mind you, this doesn’t happen all the time but it happens enough that i was very annoyed . other problems included a pull down that didn’t always go up, unresponsive menu button among others .  . performance: . while you get a powerful snapdragon 808 under the hood, it’s hard to figure out just how capable it really is because there aren’t a lot of ways to compare how fast a windows phone is with android and ios . windows phone uses different apps than ios and android . that said, i did do some side-by-side comparisons for tasks like launching the camera and loading webpages . the nexus 6p is always half a step faster than the 950 . in canada, last year we didn’t get any windows phone flagships in 2015 . correct me if i’m wrong, but the fanciest windows phone we got was the lumia 830 which came with a modest snapdragon 400 - something you can find on android phones as cheap as around $150 . with that said, performance is a bit of a mixed bag . while the 950 can be really fast windows phone, a lot of times it’s not because it stutters randomly from time to time . you get 3gb of ram which should make switching tasks between apps more quickly . it also probably helps if you’re using continuum . as a phone: . maximum earpiece is excellent with an easy to find sweet spot . the speakerphone is also fairly powerful . rf performance is good . i tried both a telus and rogers nano sims at the same time and it looks like they both support lte . you can choose which one you want to use for data in the settings . i only tested them for a few hours but i found the dual sim support to be kind of buggy . switching sims sometimes results in data not being usable until you reboot and sometimes the rf gets dodgy . i ran my battery test (auto brightness at 50%, netflix on wifi for an hour) and got 6 . 7 hrs . the lg g4 only manages 5 . 6 hrs but then again, i’ve found that this test favours oled over lcd so they’re actually quite similar . media capabilities: . there’s a speaker on the back next to the camera . it’s relatively loud but it has no bass so it sounds thin . there’s a microsd slot located under the battery cover . you can swap cards without having to turning the 950 off . i also noticed that the speaker volume will randomly lower even though i didn’t touch the volume buttons nor do i see any change in volume on screen . conclusion: . in the end, i was a bit disappointed with the 950 . while its spec sheet is top notch, the package itself leaves a bit to be desired . last year, oneplus made a big splash with their first model; the one which they dubbed the “flagship killer” . however, the ‘almost flagship’ market has matured considerably in 2015 and now, there is quite a gap between the the one’s follow up; the 2 and an entry level handset . with that in mind, here’s the oneplus x which is designed and priced to fit neatly in this gap . it basically has the guts of a late 2014/early 2015 flagship with an upper-midrange price tag . vs zte axon: . the axon is $400 in canada from fido while in the us it’s $329 . 99 .  . the oneplus x is $249 . 99 usd which after shipping and taxes is a bit a bit more affordable than the zte . the axon has a larger display, double the built-in storage, and a slightly larger battery . having 32gb of built-in storage is a real plus but at the same time the axon has a terrible camera . while the x’s camera is nothing to write home about either, it's a more balanced phone . that coupled with its more palatable price, dual sim support and extra ram make it a better buy . asus zenfone 2 64gb: . the zenfone 2 comes with double the ram, quadruple the storage, a bigger screen and a bigger battery . the x counters with a microsd slot, an easier to handle body and vastly superior build quality . this is a much harder choice . the zenfone’s 64gb of storage is very practical and the bigger screen is a nice thing to have but at the same time it’s got a really chintzy body that’s hard to overlook . i’d say it’s 50/50, you can’t go wrong with either phone . motorola moto x play: . the moto x costs slightly more . it has a bigger screen and a gigantic 3630mah battery which makes it easy to live with . at the same time, the oneplus has a slick metal body, and an extra gb of ram and a more powerful processor . the oneplus is the sexier device but pretty much everyone can appreciate the play’s larger battery . again, i’d say you can’t go wrong with either phone . body: . my first impression of the x’s body is that it reminds me of an iphone 4 + galaxy s5 . the overall shape is similar to an iphone 4/4s while the grooved sides are like the galaxy s5’s . the metal frame is striking and allows for grooves which are much more tightly packed than the s5 . it has one of the nicer black glass backs . the deep blacks on the screen help it meld with the rest of the body . it’s also very compact for a 5” phone . the buttons stick out the right amount and have a nice click when you press them . the nano sim tray can hold 2 nano sims or 1 nano sim and 1 microsd . there’s a switch on the left side with 3 stops; top position is silent, middle is priority contacts only while the bottom settings is regular . unlike the 2, the x uses an older style microusb connector . that means there’s a good chance your existing cables will work with it . display: . the x has a 5” 1920x1080 amoled display . it looks beautiful with inky blacks and very nice saturated colour without looking over-saturated . when you look closely, you’ll see that it’s pixels are arranged in a pentile arrangement . pretty much all amoled phone screens are like this . however, at 440+ ppi you won’t notice this . unlike the much costlier htc one a9, which also has a 5” amoled screen, the x’s display is noticeably brighter . amoled displays often struggle outdoors if they’re not bright enough . it’s been overcast lately so i haven’t been able to test the x outside but i expect it to have no problems outdoors . viewing angles are excellent though like all newer amoled displays it turns slightly bluish off angle . camera: . like its big brother the x, there’s a 13 megapixel camera on the back . unlike the x, the 2 lacks optical image stabilization and infrared focus assist . image quality is average at best . compared to the moto x play, the oneplus takes noisier pictures which more artifacts and less details in shadows . white balance is also slightly worse . if you take a lot of pictures, you’ll want to keep looking . the lack of stabilization and less than ideal sensor also makes for messy looking video unless you’re holding it very still . software: . the 2’s predecessor, the one shipped with cyanogenmod’s operating system . it was a salubrious relationship but due to various factors, oneplus now ships their phones with their own oxygen os . it’s a layer that sits on top of android 5 . 1 . basically, it’s vanilla android with a few custom tweaks here and there . the settings in particular contain a few extra options that enthusiasts will like, like the ability to launch programs by double pressing the buttons plus some lock screen gestures . while you can double press a button to launch the camera, the phone has to be unlocked first which limits this function’s usefulness . oneplus just announced that they’ll be upgrading the x to android 6 . 0 marshmallow sometime in q1 2016 . performance: . under the hood is a snapdragon 801 soc back with 3gb of ram . most of the time snapdragon 800’s are usually reserved for flagship devices so it’s quite rare to find one in anything that’s less than $500 unless you’re looking at a previous year’s model . why are 800 series processors popping up on moderately priced phones? i’m guessing it’s due to competitive pressures plus there being a performance gap between snapdragon 600 and 800 class processors . so, rather than bringing out a new line that bridges the gap, older 800 series soc will do the job . the x is backed by 3gb of ram too which is also uncommon at this price point . while the 801, “only’ has 4 cores, is “only” 32bit and more of an early 2014 flagship soc, its adreno 430gpu is substantially more powerful than the 405 in the 615 . however, when it comes to browsing the web there isn’t a big gap between the 615 and the 801 . the difference is more pronounced when it comes to graphics . as a phone: . maximum earpiece is slightly better than average mostly because the sweet spot is very easy to find . the speakerphone is also slightly more powerful than average . both the earpiece and speakerphone have very, very clean sounding incoming audio . rf performance is average . it managed 5hrs in my netflix test . 5hrs isn’t too bad but the x has an amoled screen so i was expecting a tiny bit more . assuming this doesn’t happen regularly, it should last the day for everyone including power users . one nice extra is support for dual sims . an even nicer extra is that the second sim isn’t 2g only . i popped a telus sim in the second slot (a carrier with no 2g gsm) . both sims appear to support lte . media capabilities: . there’s a single speaker on the bottom of the x . it’s somewhat loud with above average sound quality . there are custom settings you can use . if you turn them off, then the speaker sounds a bit flat . the headphone jack is located at the top . while you only get 16gb of built-in storage, 16gb is just enough to live with for most people . if you need more you can pop a microsd in . just remember than the microsd slot is shared with the second nano sim slot . if you want to use both sims, you can’t use a microsd . conclusion: . i paid $329 . 99 canadian, 30 . 99 for shipping and 46 . 80 for tax for a grand total of just over $400 . the x is a really nice phone but at the same time, you can get a zenfone 2 for about the same price plus you don’t have to wait for an invite . it’s a good phone that’s well priced but it’s not as good a deal as its bigger brother, the oneplus 2 . when we talk about android flagships, each year htc is usually one of the first names to pop up . however, 2015’s flagship, the one m9, has been maligned a bit in the media because it’s not that much better than it’s predecessor, the m8 . while it ships with a more powerful soc, due to heat issues, it rarely gets a chance to stretch its legs; the camera, while higher resolution doesn’t take very good pictures . that sort of thing . fortunately, htc usually releases something interesting in q3/q4 . previous q3/q4 releases include the htc butterfly (one of the first 1080p phones), htc one max (their first phablet) and the nexus 9 (their first tablet in a while) . since the m9 is the most maligned htc flagship in a while, they’ve decided to market their q3 curiosity as their new flagship . indeed, the a9’s slick metal body is certainly a good start . what about the rest of it . vs lg nexus 5x: . for slightly less money, you can pick up the nexus 5x . while the pricing is similar, each is a very different animal . the 5x has a flagship-ish snapdragon 808 while the a9 makes do with a mid-range 618 . the 5x camera also takes the best still photos of any phone right now . it also has a slightly larger 2700mah battery . otherwise, the a9 has some pretty big advantages; it has a much nicer looking 5” 1920x1080 amoled display . 3gb of ram is a little bit more convenient as is the 32gb of storage and microsd slot . i also find the front-mounted fingerprint reader more intuitive to use . while the a9’s camera isn’t as good as the 5x’s, the htc’s optical image stabilization helps it take better looking video though it's limited to 1080p whereas the 5x goes up to 4k . however, the best thing about the a9 is its metal body . the brushed metal back feels like glass and has a sense of occasion sorely missing from the 5x . is a snapdragon 808 better than having 3gb of ram . is the 5x’s market leading camera better than the a9’s . despite the advantages, the 32gb 5x is priced nearly $90 lower so i’d say you can’t go wrong with either .  . vs oneplus 2: . then there’s the oneplus 2 . if you’re able to get an invite, the 2 offers a bit more of everything . it comes with a more powerful snapdragon 810 soc, more ram, more storage, bigger screen . heck, it even has a snazzy metal body . the only thing the a9 has going for it is a microsd and arguably a more classy body . the a9 is a nice phone but it’s priced about $150 too high . vs motorola moto x play: . the moto x play has a slightly less powerful 615 soc, only 16gb of storage, less ram (2 vs 3gb), plastic body and no image stabilization . then again, it comes with a very useful 3630mah battery and a larger 5 . 5” display . the a9 is undoubtedly a nicer phone with more ram and storage but i’m not sure it’s worth paying an extra $250 for it . body: . the a9’s body is positively delicious . first off, at 5”, it’s quite a bit smaller than most similarly priced phones . while phablet and phablet-ish phones are nice, 5” is still large big enough to display a lot of information while simultaneously being very usable with just one hand . in terms of how it feels in your hand, it's even fancier than an iphone 6 . the shape is very organic - there are no sharp edges so it’s very pleasant to hold . the polished metal back is so smooth it feels like glass - at the same time it doesn’t feel like it’s been covered with a ton of lacquer so it feels real unlike its predecessor the m8 . look at the finish on the power button - it looks awesome . however, while the buttons stick out the right amount, they could use a tiny bit more feel when you press them in . notice how the back and sides are one piece of metal but they have 2 different finishes . they spent a lot of time trying to make the a9 look classy yet at the same time it’s not gauche . it provides both a sense of occasion yet is also very usable at the same time . display: . it’s been awhile since i’ve used an htc phone with an amoled screen . i think the last one i tried was my nexus one from many years ago . the a9’s is actually a superamoled display . at a glance, the display on the a9 is excellent . blacks are very deep so colours pop . while colors pop, they’re also very restrained at the same time so the display looks more realistic . upon closer inspection, there is noticeable colour shift when you view if off-angle but this is par for the course for amoled displays . another thing i noticed is that the display isn’t very bright . i suspect htc dialed down the maximum brightness since the a9 comes with an undersized 2150mah battery . a mostly white screen, at maximum brightness can draw a crazy amount of power on a superamoled so this is necessary trade-off . lately it been pretty overcast so i haven’t had a chance to try the a9 outside . i mention this because amoled screen in general washout outdoors . most recent samsung phones tackle this problem with good results by having ridiculously bright displays . camera: . the htc one m7 was one of the first phones to ship with optical image stabilization, so i was positively gutted this useful feature was left off the m8 and m9 . fortunately, it’s back . this time, it's paired with a 13 megapixel sensor . the sensor can take decent pictures but i found that in the 10 days or so that i’ve had it, it has taken very few keepers . seems every single picture i took was either slightly out of focus, had too much motion blur, had large dark swaths or was too bright . the camera also tends to miss certain colours . particularly blue which can sometimes end up almost purple . there is a raw mode which saves pictures in dng format . i didn’t play with it much - just remember that saving photos in dng format slows down the shot-to-shot speeds . video was fairly smooth thanks to the stabilization but it also tends to crush dark areas so that they don’t have any detail . the mic is quite good . while the a9 is positioned as a flagship phone, it just might be the only 2015 flagship that doesn’t required 4k video . the front facing camera is a 4 megapixel “ultrapixel” camera with a wide angle lens . the same sensor has been on the back of some past htc flagships like the m7 and m8 . it tends to take gritty looking pictures . i generally wasn’t that pleased with it either . software: . the a9 is one of the first non-nexus phones to ship with android 6 marshmallow . at a launch event a few months back, i was told by htc that they would be ditching a lot of their built-in apps that duplicate the existing ones that come with android . however, the a9 which i have right now seems to have more or less the same amount of extra stuff you’d normally get with an htc phone . i don’t have a m9 handy to compare but the only things i don’t see on the a9 is duplicate web browser from htc and blinkfeed . otherwise, you still extras like mail, zoe along with some htc utilities like weather, flashlight, voice recorder, etc . it’s not to say that the a9 comes with lots of crap wear (it doesn’t) but if you’re looking for a nexus like experience you should stick with a nexus . the a9’s software is still fundamentally htc . performance: . inside is a qualcomm snapdragon 617 . in 2015, 600 series snapdragons are generally found on phones that cost 300-400 so you’re probably wondering what it’s doing in a $650 phone . at a glance, the 617 isn’t all that different from the 615 in the moto x play . actually, the 4 faster cores in the a9’s 617 are clocked slightly slower than the 615 in the play - 1 . 7 vs 1 . 5ghz . still, despite the slightly lower speeds, the a9 actually scores slightly higher in most benchmarks . i’m guessing the higher scores are probably due to the fact that the 617 supports slight faster ram (according to qualcomm’s site) . the 617’s adreno 405 gpu is also slightly updated, it supports opengl es 3 . 1 . while the a9 scores a bit higher than the moto x, it's no match for a 800 series snapdragon (808 in the 5x and 810 in the oneplus 2) when it comes to graphics . the real difference between the 615 and the 617 is that the 617 supports carrier aggregation for speeds of up to 300mbps . of course, while you’ll probably never encounter these speeds in real life, it can also benefit when the network is congested . as a phone: . maximum earpiece is good while the speakerphone is only average . rf performance is average . i recently started testing battery life by playing netflix for an hour and then extrapolating how long it would take for a phone to run out of juice . now that i’ve tested a few phones, it seems the test favors amoled display . amoled displays thrive indoors when you’re watching video because videos tend to be darker than webpages (in general) and amoled screens draw less power when the screen is darker . media capabilities: . unlike the last couple of htc flagships, the a9 lacks stereo speakers . you get a earpiece and a bottom mounted speaker like most phones but you can only use one at a time . it’s reasonably loud and while i wouldn’t say it sounds terrible, it’s worse than what you get in the m9, m8 and m7 . there’s 32gb of storage which you can expand with microsd cards . htc claims that the headphone amp on the a9 has double the volume of competitors . while i am unable to verify that the a9’s headphone amp really is 3db louder than some competitors, i can say that it kicks like a mule - it’s really loud . they’re also saying that the a9 is able to process 24bit/192khz audio files . htc included their optional htc pro studio earphones which are a pair of in-ear monitor style headphones . they do get quite loud and can easily damage your hearing so make sure you don’t play with the higher volume settings unless you’re listening to a really quiet song . conclusion: . the a9 has one of the fanciest bodies of any phone this year . that said, while it’s a reasonably well rounded phone, it’s price is just too high . the problem with the a9 is that at 649 it basically costs about the same as a full-fat flagship like the nexus 6p ($50 more), lg g4 or a sony xperia z5 . is the a9 a lot nicer than a mid-range phone? absolutely, but the other phones i mentioned offer better processors and cameras for about the same money . one of last year’s most interesting phones was the oneplus one . it was tailor made for enthusiasts; it packed flagship level specs with the popular cyanogenmod operating system all for a very palatable price . to top it off, you needed an invite from oneplus before you could buy one . of course, one requirement to being an enthusiast is having a short attention span so now we have the one’s follow-up: the predictably named oneplus 2 . let’s check it out: . lg nexus 5x: . you can pick up a 16gb nexus 5x for similar money . first off, the 5x is much easier to acquire, you walk into a carrier store and buy it or order online from google play . no need to sign up and wait for an invite . you also don’t need to pay extra for shipping since it’s built into the 5x’s price . however, if you can pick up a 2, you’ll get a much fancier metal body, exchangeable back covers, 4gb of ram, 64gb of storage, a bigger screen (5 . 5” vs 5), bigger battery (3400mah vs 2700) and a beefier processor . the 5x does have a better looking screen and probably the best camera on the market . it’s also a nexus device, so it’s first in line to get new android releases from google (for, i’m guessing, 2 to 3 years) . the 2is the obvious choice - as long as you can put up with the invite system . body: . the first thing you’ll notice is the substantial feeling metal frame . the materials and finishes all feel very classy .  . from the cleanly drilled speaker holes to the chamfered bezels, the 2 has the body of a phone that could cost a lot more . i like its heft too - like the kind you get from a fancy watch . you can order the 2 with different back covers including different wood ones . the original one had this feature as well, but the back covers were almost impossible to remove . the 2’s is much easier to remove yet it still manages to be very secure . i just stuck with the standard sandstone cover - it’s rough and kind of feels like a pumice stone . don’t worry, i didn’t try to use it as one . there are power and volume buttons on the right side of the phone . they don’t stick out enough and as far feel goes, they aren’t very good . this makes them kind of unpredictable at times . there’s a 3 position silent mode slider on the left side . top position is silent, middle is priority contacts only while the bottom settings is regular . you can choose between using capacitive menu buttons or on-screen ones like on the original one . the capacitive buttons flank the home button/fingerprint sensor . it doesn’t press in like the reader on a samsung or iphone . you can touch it to use it like a home button or place and hold your finger on it to use it as a reader . i love how you can set the 2 up to wake up and unlock when you place your finger on it . you save an extra action vs apple where you press the home button to wake it up and then again to get your fingerprint read . still, as a reader, it’s not quite as good as the readers on the latest nexus phones and the iphone 6s series . sometimes it takes a few extra presses . one of the 2’s signature features is that it comes with a new usb type-c charging connector . with the exception of apple, most of the industry is still using microusb . that said the industry is going to start shifting to usb-c starting next year . usb-c connectors can be plugged in either way so you don’t have to pay close attention when you plug it in now . it can also handle a lot more power so going forward some laptops will use it for charging too so road warriors will now just need to carry one type of cable around instead of a microusb + laptop charger . still, since the 2 is one of the first devices with this, chances are that you won’t have any spare ones lying around . in that sense you may find it inconvenient if you’re using to having a lot of spares like myself . it may be more convenient but you’re still going to have to re-buy your cables . if you do this in the short term you’ll probably be paying more per cable that you’ve grown accustomed to with microusb . andrew’s also been posting that usb type-c cables may have some compatibility issues with the new nexus devices . this would make me weary to buy anything right now until things settle down . display: . the 2 continues to use a 5 . 5” 1920x1080 display but it looks much nicer than the one’s . that said, it’s still slightly washed out . there’s this whiteness to the display that shows through the colors . it’s hard to capture with a camera so you’ll have to take my word for it . it’s also not a color temperature issue because you can set a custom level via a slider . it’s also not quite as bright as some competitors though i didn’t notice this until i compared it side-by-side so this isn’t really an issue . it also loses a bit more brightness off-angle but it’s also pretty minor . overall, it’s a decent display . if you’re worried about it not being quad-hd like some other flagships don’t sweat it . to my eye’s, it's every bit as sharp . i noticed that the 2 shipped with plastic screen protector . it’s nice that they did this, but is there a reason why? i hope they were just being generous and not trying to cover up something sinister like the display not using top notch screen coatings . camera: . you get a 13 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization . it has a f/2 . 0 lens, dual led flash and laser autofocusing . it takes decent pictures but when i look up close, i notice there’s very aggressive noise reduction which removes some detail . otherwise, it focuses quickly and is intuitive to use . the optical image stabilization helps with video but the microphone picks up a lot of handling noise . i suspect the rough finish on the back is partially to blame for this . overall, the camera is good but not great . software: . the 2’s predecessor, the one shipped with cyanogenmod’s operating system . it was a salubrious relationship but due to various factors, oneplus now ships their phones with their own oxygen os . it’s a layer that sits on top of android 5 . 1 . basically it’s vanilla android with a few custom tweaks here and there . the settings in particular contain a few extra options that enthusiasts will like like the ability to launch programs by double pressing the buttons plus some lock screen gestures . while you can double press a button to launch the camera, the phone has to be unlocked first which limits this function’s usefulness . oneplus just announced that they’ll be upgrading the 2 to android 6 . 0 marshmallow sometime in q1 2016 . performance: . you get a snapdragon 810 soc which is backed by either 3 or 4gb of ram . in everyday usage, there’s no real difference between 3 and 4gb of ram . the nexus 5x has a more modest snapdragon 808 soc which has half as many of the 810’s 4 higher-power a57 cores . most of the time, there isn’t a huge difference between 2 and 4 cores . it does make a big difference in certain benchmarks, which are tailored to use all 4 cores but in everyday usage, you rarely need more than 2 . one thing that’s nice about the 2 is that the 810 is more for qhd devices (2560x1440) while the 808 for full hd (1920x1080) . since the 2 “only” has full hd it has meatier graphics scores . the 810 has a reputation for generating a lot of heat . while the top of the 2 gets fairly warm, it doesn’t get hot . as a phone: . maximum earpiece is average as is the speakerphone . rf performance is average . in my netflix test, the 2 battery lasted an impressive 6 . 25 hrs . that said, one time it drained rapidly while it was just sitting there doing nothing . it may just be an isolated incident . assuming this doesn’t happen regularly, it should last the day for everyone including power users . one nice extra is support for dual sims . an even nicer extra is that the second sim isn’t 2g only . i popped a telus sim in the second slot (a carrier with no 2g gsm) . both sims appear to support lte . media capabilities: . there’s a single speaker on the bottom of the 2 . it’s somewhat loud with above average sound quality . there are custom settings you can use . if you turn them off, then the speaker sounds a bit flat . the headphone jack is located at the top . while there’s no microsd card, a 64gb 2 is relatively affordable and is probably enough storage for most users . if you don’t need a lot of space there’s also a “base” model with 16gb of ram . conclusion: . while a weak canadian dollar makes 2 a harder sell than the one, it still represents an excellent value proposition . mine is the 4gb/64gb step-up model . i paid $479 canadian plus, 30 . 99 for shipping and handling and 66 . 30 in taxes for a total of $576 . 29 . that said, oneplus’ invite system, while kind of neat/fun the first time around, now it just feels unnecessary and inconvenient . i mean phone nerds probably still find it to be pretty cool but try explaining to a “normob” and they’ll just take the path of least resistance like ordering a nexus 5x from googleplay . still, if you’re thinking of heading down the road of 2 ownership the invite system is just a minor bump . it’s a great phone - i don’t have to qualify this with “for the money” . the last few zte phones that have come across my desk were all outstanding phones for the money . the problem with this is that the people that typically buy those kind of phones have no idea who made it . if zte wants to move upmarket, they’ll need to replicate their formula of offering more phone for less dough . zte’s budget line is called “grand” so here’s their range-topper, the axon . you can find at fido for a very un-zte $400 . i can’t think of any other $400 phones that come with a snapdragon 801 soc, 32gb of storage and a metal body . they’re definitely off to a good start; let’s check out the rest of the package . vs motorola moto x play: . for the same money, the moto x play has a more modest soc, half the storage and only a single camera on the back . however, it's a much more well-rounded package mostly because the camera is a huge step up, the huge 3630mah battery also provides epic runtime though the zte isn’t too shabby in this department . vs 2014 motorola moto x: . you can get last year’s moto x for $400 unlocked from staples canada . it has the same snapdragon 801 soc though you only get half the storage . between the axon and the moto x, it’s a tougher call . if you need an unlocked phone, then the x is a easy choice but then again getting a phone unlocked is usually pretty straight forward . the moto x’s big flaw is that it only comes with 16gb of storage which isn’t expandable . i guess 16gb is enough storage that you can live with it but the axon comes with a much more generous 32gb . neither has a great camera but the moto x’s is a bit better . the moto x’s trump card is that it just might be the most comfortable metal framed phone ever made . the axon’s metal back is no slouch but once you’ve held a 2nd gen moto x, you’ll know what i mean . anyways, either phone is a really balanced package so it’s a toss up . vs lg nexus 5x: . for another $100, you can get the unlocked nexus 5x . for your extra money, you get a phone with one of the very best cameras on the market . it’s soc is also a bit faster . the axon counters with more built-in storage - a very practical feature and a metal back . even though the 5x has less storage, it’s a more well-rounded package and thus easier to live with choice . if you need more storage you can pick up a 32gb variant for an extra $60 can . body: . the back is metal with plastic on the top and bottom parts . it makes the axon a very solid phone . yup, there are 2 cameras on the back . the top and bottom of the front look like they are are covered with long speaker grills . however, if you look closely you’ll see that only small part of it is used as a speaker . the rest are not functional . they remind me of a car that has a huge scoop on the hood that doesn’t actually do anything . there’s a camera shutter button on the side which you can double press to quickly launch the camera . note that the volume buttons are on the left while the power button and shutter buttons are on the right . i prefer this arrangement as it keeps the sides from getting too cluttered . there are capacitive back and task switch buttons on the front below the screen . you can swap them around in the menus . it’s a nice phone to hold that’s easy to use . display: . in front is a 5 . 5” 1920x1080 ips lcd display . at 400ppi, it’s extremely sharp . viewing angles are decent . colour looks accurate . black levels could be a little deeper but at this price point, it’s to be expected . overall, it’s a very good display . camera: . you can double press the shutter button on the side to start the camera from any screen . you can also use it when the phone is locked . there are dual cameras on the back; a 13 megapixel one for shooting still photos while the other, is a 2 megapixel which captures depth information . yes, it’s a similar setup as last year’s htc one m8 . the extra camera allows the axon to blur out the background . here’s how it works . you know how slr cameras usually have nicely blurred out backgrounds? it’s mostly a function of their imaging sensors which are many times larger than a typical smartphone’s (there are other factors but that’s one of the main ones) . so, larger sensors means a shallower depth of field . on the other hand, smartphone sensor which are comparatively tiny, have extremely deep depth of fields . just look at this photo, while i’m in focus, so is the background . back to slr cameras, a shallow depth of field is often desirable because it helps to isolate your subject . since the axon’s second camera captures depth information, it knows where the background is and is able to blur them out to approximate the effect you’d get from a much bigger sensor . this is all great but there’s a big problem; the axon’s camera sensor isn’t very good . it’s very noisy indoors and has a very limited dynamic range . dark areas have no details while bright areas are usually blown out . it’s only usable outdoors or indoors when there is plenty of light and your scene doesn’t have anything too bright (like a window) or too dark . i can’t help but wonder if the axon would have been better off if zte had ditched the extra camera and used those resourced on putting a better sensor in . it’s a real shame because the camera app itself actually has a lot of features . the manual mode in particular isn’t bad: . shutter speed . iso . exposure . white balance . metering mode (spot, center, average) . interval shooting . there’s also a rule of thirds grid and a level (they called it a gradienter) . to take advantage of the depth camera, there’s a bokeh mode which lets you choose just how blurred you want your background to be . you can go back and adjust the amount of blur and focus after the fact . video also looks pretty awful . it can record at 4k but the quality is so bad, there’s no point . recorded audio doesn’t sound all that great either . software: . you get android 5 . 1 . 1 with zte’s overlay . it’s a pretty standard overlay, custom home screen, modified pull down toggles, skinned buttons along with duplicates for some of the built-in apps . extras include: . dolby audio . file manager . fm radio . gallery . mi-moment . music . rockmyrun . sound recorder . task manager . touchpal . the default keyboard is touchpal which looks like it’s designed more for users who require chinese character entry . one nice extra is that there is support for multiple users . zte hasn’t had the greatest record when it comes to keeping their devices updated here in canada . however, the thing to remember is that until now, zte phones were all budget specials . software updates aren’t as important to this segment of the market as it is to someone who shelling out for a flagship . i recently had a chance to sit down with lixin cheng, president of zte north america and he acknowledged that software updates are important to a phone like the axon because it’s their zte flagship device here in canada . while he didn’t make any promises, the fact that he’s cognisant of the importance of updates to the axon means there’s a better chance it will get updates . performance: . powering the show is a 32bit qualcomm snapdragon 801 soc which is backed by 2gb of ram . it’s typical of what you’d find in an early 2014 flagship phone like a samsung gs5 or an htc one m8 . most competitors are using 64bit snapdragon 615 soc’s . is newer better? not really, while its newer, qualcomm is really good at making sure there’s quite a cushion between their flagship 800 series soc and the not-quite flagship 600 series . having said that, strangely enough, the axon scores noticeably lower than the 2014 moto x even though they have the same soc . one reason is because the moto’s runs at up to 2 . 5ghz while the axon’s only goes up to 2 . 3ghz but clock speed alone doesn’t account for the gap in their scores . note that i re-tested the 2014 moto x to see if android/app updates have lowered its scores . in case you’re wondering, they’re about the same . the pcmark score is especially puzzling .  . is it a ram speed issue? maybe the axon ships with slower ram? i ran geekbench and the axon’s ram actually scores higher than the x, so it’s not that . fortunately, pcmark has a setting where you can view the clock speed while it’s running . turns out that the axon’s clock speed is usually much lower than the 2014 x’s .  . is it a case of the axon running too hot and having to keep its speed under wraps? i doubt it because it barely gets warm when running pcmark . i tried tossing it in the fridge for a while but that doesn’t result in higher scores so it’s not a heat issue . for some reason it’s just unwilling to put the pedal to the metal . you’re probably wondering what affect these scores have on everyday usage . i tried using both the axon and the moto x play side-by-side and most of the time there’s no difference . webpages load at the same time on both devices, apps load at the same speed, that sort of thing . the only time the axon feels faster than the play is when you’re installing apps or launching large ones . in those cases the axon is usually a few seconds faster . game levels also typically load a tiny bit faster on the zte . where the axon really pulls ahead is in graphics performance . when you type in a new address in google maps and are flying around, it’s is quite a bit smoother . while the 801 is afraid to run fast, its gpu seems unaffected . as a phone: . while maximum earpiece volume is average, the earpiece sweet spot is hard to locate because it is located too close to the edge . this also makes it uncomfortable to use . it’s form over function . speakerphone maximum volume is average . rf performance is average . inside is a large 3000mah battery . the axon managed an above average 6 . 7 hours of netflix playback though it trails the moto x play and its impressive 12 . 5 hrs . media capabilities: . the large grill on the top and bottom make it look as if the axon has a mean set of stereo speakers . however, as it turns out, they’re mostly there for looks . only a few are actually used for the speakers while the rest are not functional . further, you can only use one at a time so there’s no stereo . the worst thing though is that the speakers don’t sound all that great . they don’t have a lot of bass and they’re not that loud . zte talks up the sound on the axon because it has a discrete (separate) dac and adc chips . they should have spent that money on better speakers . when i connected my headphones (sennheiser momentum on-ear), i was appalled at the sound quality . as it turns out, that’s because the dolby sound setting was turned on . the default setting sounds like it’s been tuned by a child who turned all the settings to max . once you’ve turned the dolby setting off, sound quality is pretty good . i did a bit of listening to it but couldn’t really tell if the separate dac and adc’s make a difference - mostly because i couldn't guarantee the source where my flac files were coming from . anyways, the axon has a excellent sound quality plus it’s quite powerful . conclusion: . the snapdragon 801 and 32gb of built-in storage are fairly generous for its price point . ditto for the classy metal case . however, the camera, which draws a lot of attention to itself is not up to snuff and the speakers are forgettable . while the zte axon has some high points at a reasonable price, overall it’s not a well rounded package . the lg nexus 5x signifies two changes in google’s nexus strategy . first off, it’s the first nexus that’s actually smaller than its predecessor while at the same time, the line itself bifurcates into regular and phablet sizes . to me, the smaller size tells me that that for now, the market has decided that they're happy with how large phones are in general . the 6p is also smaller than the 6 but it’s still one of the larger phones on the market, which should satisfy people like me who don’t mind something a little bigger . the 5x is for people who don’t want to sacrifice portability and reach-ability for the largest size possible . vs nexus 6p: . the 6p costs a bit more but for your extra money you get quite a bit more phone . a bigger, better display, 3gb of ram vs 2gb (a noticeable difference), more generous storage options, more battery life and much better speakers . if you can handle the extra size then i’d say go for the 5x . i did notice when i was typing out the lte band support that the 5x and 6p differ slightly . the 5x adds bands 1, and 20 while it lacks band 30 . i checked and it looks like band is owned by at&t and isn’t currently used for lte while 1 and 20 are more for roaming overseas . vs nexus 5: . the nexus 5 has been around for 2 years now . that said, it has aged well and in absolute terms, the specs kind of slot it in between a 2015 mid-range and high end phone . while the 5x lacks optical image stabilization, i’d say it’s an all-around better phone . if you liked the 5 for its reasonable size, note that the 5x is quite a bit larger . the screen is only 0 . 2” bigger but it’s got a much bigger top and bottom . on the 6p, this is to accommodate the stereo speakers but on the 5x, i get the feeling it’s more to accommodate google’s design language . that and perhaps to make room for a larger battery in the back . body: . the front is pretty generic looking . i call it boring, andrew calls it “clean” . i think we’re both right . the design is identical to the 6p save for the speaker grills which differs on each . i prefer the lg’s drilled grills over the 6p’s less interesting covers . while the design looks the same, the 5x can only use one of the speakers at a time, they’re not used for stereo like they are on the 6p . the rear design differs from the 6p . it’s a very clean design with plastic cover and a matte paint job . while i’m not a fan of the 6p, the huawei’s metal back is much more tactile and gives it a sense of occasion that’s sorely missing from the 5x’s which feels much more austere . i’d go as far as to say that the back cover feels a bit cheap . note that i’m not a metal phone snob, the lg g4 has a plastic body and it’s very solid . heck, the much more modest g4 vigor’s plastic body also feels much nicer . you get a fingerprint reader on the back, like the 6p but i noticed something funny . since the 5x is narrower than the 6p, i find it’s reader less conveniently placed . on a taller and wider phone like the 6p, your index finger normally lies closer to the reader on the back which makes it more intuitive to use . still, i think the idea of a rear-mounted reader to be a flawed one . i often sit down to work so i don’t like having to lift a phone up to have to unlock it . otherwise the reader works well . i like how you can put your finger on it to turn on the phone and unlock it in one motion . one important factor when determine how nice a phone is to use is the size of it . if you’ve used a phablet and found it to be too big, then you might like how the 5x is one size smaller . just check out what andrew had to say about it . and in case you’re wondering, he’s currently rocking a nexus 6 and finds it a bit too large . at the bottom is a usb type-c connector . it’s a new type of usb connector that can carry enough power to charge a laptop plus it’s reversible so you don’t need to worry about whether your microusb is upside down or not . the new connector works well but in the short term, it causes 2 problems . first off, if you like the convenience of having a few extra micro usb cables then you’ll need to go out and get new cables . secondly, for now type-c cables are not that common and will probably cost you a bit more if you want extras now . that’s the cost of being an early adopter . type-c cables can either have the type-c connector at both ends (think a microusb connector but rounded) or a type-c on one end and a regular type a connector (the one that goes into the square old-style connector that’s probably on your computer) . the nexus 5x comes with a type-c charger and a type-c to type-c cable so if you want to connect it to your computer that doesn’t have type-c (most don’t) then you’ll need to shell out for a type-c to type a cable . speaking of charging, like the 6p, the 5x omits wireless charging - a feature previously championed by google . does this mean wireless charging is dead? while i’m 100% sure wireless charging will be back, for now it’s sort of on life support . in it’s current incarnation, it’s just too limiting to be useful so has some growing up to do before it’s a must-have feature . display: . you get a 5 . 2” ips lcd with a resolution of 1920x1080 . with a sharpness of over 400 ppi it’s as sharp as a tack . color is also quite nice . check it out, when you’re viewing identical home screens on the 5x and the 6p and have them side-by-side the colors on them is almost identical . both phone displays have received a lot of tuning . that said, i was a little disappointed with the display because it doesn’t have the deepest blacks . i was expecting something like what you get with the g4 . overall, it’s a minor issue but since i’ve been spoiled by the g4, it’s something i noticed . overall though, this is a minor problem . i think most will be happy with it . camera: . on the back you get the same brilliant camera as the nexus 6p . it has a dual led flash, autofocus and the same laser autofocus which is also found on the lg g3, g4, etc . despite a lack of optical image stabilization - a feature which is becoming very common, the 5x cameras is one of the very best cameras on the market . it’s ability to control noise without sacrificing detail is impressive . focusing is usually quick and accurate . shot-to-shot speeds are good . if you have the 5x and 6p side-by-side, you’ll notice that the 5x pictures look a lot brighter on its screen . i suspect it’s a amoled vs lcd thing . when you download the pictures to your computer, they’ll look more or less the same . i love how you can quickly launch the camera by double pressing the power button . while the rear-facing cameras are identical the front-facing cameras are different . the 6p’s is quite a bit better in low light than the 5x’s which isn’t all that great . while the omission of stabilization doesn’t keep the 5x from taking great pictures, it does make for jerky video . while it looks fine if you’re staying still, the moment you move, there’s no doubt it’s not as smooth as some other phones . software: . like the 6p, the 5x comes with android 6 . 0 . as such, this section is taken from the 6p review . included is android 6 . 0 marshmallow . if you’re into android and software updates then google’s nexus phones are the ones to get . the 5x’s great, great grandfather, the nexus 4 received updates from google for closet to 3 years . more importantly, nexus devices are usually the first to receive updates . you don’t usually need to wait for your device manufacturer to wait while they re-skin android and give you your update a week before the next one comes out . to me, the most noticeable upgrade to 6 . 0 is built-in fingerprint reader support . i’ve been using readers since the iphone 5s and once you’ve used one, it’s hard to go back to pin codes, passwords and unlocking patterns . i used to use pin codes religiously but now i find them a nuisance and can’t be bothered . a small change i noticed is that the 5x will tell you how fast it's charging (regular or fast charging) along with time remaining to full charge . it’s nice to know how fast it’s going when you’re using a new charger you’re not familiar with . by default, the 6p will only charge when you connect it to a computer . so if you want to transfer files, you’ll need to go in and change it to mtp mode manually . there is finally a built-in file manager which is hidden in the storage & usb option in settings . you’ll have to scroll down to find it . some other changes which i had to look up include improved power management when you’re not using the phone . performance: . under the hood is qualcomm’s snapdragon 808 . the 810 has gotten a rep for running quite hot, so i guess it’s more suited for phablets which have larger bodies which have more space to dissipate heat . the 810 has 8 cores, 4 of them are high power 64bit cortex a57 cores running at up to 2ghz while the 808 only has 6 of which only 2 are a57’s . so the 808 is seriously down on power compared to the 810 right? you’d think that but most of the time they’re in the same ballpark . most tasks only require one or two cores . it’s rare that a phone will have to fire up all 4 a57 cores to maximum . that’s why the 808 isn’t far off from the 810’s pace . it’s a reminder that sometimes more is not more .  . where the 810 does have an advantage is when it comes to graphics . the 810 pairs with a more powerful adreno 430 while the 808 has the adreno 418 . the 430 is more suited for qhd devices like the 6p, while the 418 pairs better with a fhd display . that’s why the 6p and 5x have similar on-screen graphics scores . the 6p comes with 3gb of ram while the 5x only comes with 2gb . this doesn’t make any difference to benchmarks but practically speaking if you switch between apps a lot then going from 2-3gb does make a small difference . as a phone: . maximum earpiece and speakerphone volume are both slightly above average . rf performance is average . you get a 2700mah battery which i’d say is sized about right for the size of the display and the soc . i tested the battery by leaving the screen brightness at 50% with adaptive brightness on . the 5x was connected to my 5ghz wifi network and placed on the corner of my desk in my brightly lit office . i played a netflix video for an hour and recorded the battery percent before and after and then extrapolated this to see how long it would take to drain the battery completely . the 5x managed 5 . 5 hrs while the 5 only managed 3 . 5 . not bad . in case you’re wondering, the 6 pulled 5 . 25 hrs while the 6p lasted a remarkable 8 . 3 hrs . media capabilities: . i adore the 6p’s stereo front facing speakers . they sound amazing and are very powerful . given than the 5x’s sibling, the g4 has one of the most powerful speakers on the market, i was expecting a lot from the 5x . they’ve received some tuning but they don’t have a lot of bass . in terms of volume, they’re about average and come up way short compared to the 6p and g4 . so while they’re average to slightly above average, i was a bit disappointed because i was expecting way more . you get the 5x with either 16 or 32gb of storage . 32gb is a nice starting point but if you need more, you’ll be disappointed because there’s no microsd slot . headphone jack is located on the bottom - where it should be as far as i’m concerned . the 6p’s is located on top of the phone . conclusion: . the 5x isn’t a bad phone but it has the misfortune of being released at the same time as the nexus 6p . the 6p addresses most of the 5x shortcomings - namely the plastic body, the milky blacks, the ordinary sounding speakers and to some, the lack of built-in storage . then again, the 6p costs quite a bit more so i guess you get what you pay for . i can imagine how excited lg was to find out that google wanted them to design the 5x and then having the wind being taken out of their sails when they said huawei would be making the 6p, the nexus flagship device . you get this feeling that while lg made the nexus 5x, they didn’t put the same enthusiasm they did when they designed the nexus 5 and the 4 . or perhaps lg didn’t want the 5x to take the spotlight away from their own branded devices so they held back a bit more on features to create more breathing room . anyways, the 5x’s advantage, or its “x” factor if you will is its size . if you think phablets are too hard to use with one hand and are too big for your pocket then chances are the 5x is the perfect size for you . it’s about as big as you can go while still being usable with just one hand, plus it’s easy to whip out of your pocket . then there's the price, at $500 can for the 16gb the 5x is priced about right . it’s right there in no-man’s land . it’s about $100 cheaper than a flagship but a bit more than a upper-midrange phone like the moto x play or a zte axom . i guess it’s close to the htc one a9 but htc doesn’t back the a9 up with the specs you’d expect at its price point . overall, while it’s not a bad phone, the 5x is overshadowed by the 6p . last year’s nexus 6 gained a lot of flack from me and andrew for its high $749 price tag . up until then, the previous couple of nexii phones offered tremendous bang for relatively speaking little bucks . expensive phones are fine if they’re best-in-class products but while the nexus 6 is a nice phone, there were better choices available . here’s the follow up, the nexus 6p from huawei . compared to the 6, the 6p receives a minor price cut; the 32gb model starts $699 . it gains a rear-mounted fingerprint reader but loses the optical image stabilization . is the 6p a worthy contender? let’s check it out . vs nexus 6: . the first thing i noticed about the 6p is that last year’s 6 has a much more coherent design . the 6p looks like a mishmash of different designs and has a back only a mother could love . looking past that, the 6p does offer quite a bit more across the board . the processor is faster, the display is much better, you also get a kickass camera along with a bigger battery and the convenience of a fingerprint reader . all for a device that costs $50 can less than what last year’s debuted at . more bang for your buck is always a good thing . while you get a faster processor, the display is the real story here . it’s brighter, has better viewing angles and better colour . last year’s 6 looks dirty and in comparison . the processor feels faster than benchmarks indicate . the camera app in particular starts noticeably faster on the 6p . speaking of the camera, while the 6p lacks the 6’s optical image stabilization it runs circles around the 6’s camera in terms of image quality and low light performance . it always felt like motorola tried to save a few bucks with the 6’s camera and then tried to cover it up with image stabilization . the 6p’s camera feels like a top-of-the-line sensor . both have pretty amazing stereo speakers . the 6p appears to utilize very strong stereo widening techniques to simulate surround sound . normally i’m not a fan of too much sound processing but when it comes to built-in speakers i’m not expecting audiophile quality . i’m more concerned that have as much bass as possible and are as loud as possible and sound reasonably accurate .  . this is where the 6p speakers shine . that said, if the music you’re listening too already sounds really processed then you might not like the result . i’ve also found that stereo widening usually results in less low-down bass and in the case of the 6p this is the case . the 6 has slightly meatier bass but 9/10 people are going to prefer the 6p over the 6’s speakers . then there’s the fingerprint reader, once you get used to the convenience of a reader it’s hard to go back to pin codes or unlock patterns . you can just unlock the screen as you’re reaching for it .  . while the back may have quite an appearance deficit but it’s quite a big upgrade over the 6 . vs nexus 5x: . for a few hundred less you can pick up the 5x . the front is almost identical to the 6p - i have a hard time telling them apart . the key is to look at the speaker grills in front . the lg’s have htc-style drilled holes while huawei doesn’t . so they have the same processor, same rear camera while the 5x has a smaller, lower resolution display along with a correspondingly smaller battery . the 5x may be more wallet friendly but you’re getting quite a bit less phone too . first off, the 6p’s screen is a considerable upgrade . i’m not talking about the 6p’s 2560x1440 resolution vs the 5x’s 1920x1080 . to my eyes they’re just as sharp as each other so don’t read anything into this useless spec . rather the 6p has a top notch superamoled display (as opposed to the nexus 6’s not-that-great superamoled) while the 5x has not-quite-flagship level ips lcd . it has decent colour but it’s blacks aren’t very good plus there is some unevenness on the right near the top . the 2 rear-facing cameras are identical but the front facing camera on the 5x is noticeably worse . the 6p’s speakers are much louder, you get 2 of them (only one at a time on the 5x) plus they sound much better on the 6p . neither phone is exactly a looker . they’re both extremely generic and unmemorable in front though i do prefer the 5x’s speaker holes vs the 6p’s speaker ‘pills’ in front . the 6p and its metal body feels much nicer than the 5x’s plastic body . while the 5x’s sibling, the lg g4 also has a plastic body, the 5x’s feels much cheaper . to be honest, the worst thing about the 5x is that it was released around the same time as the 6p . if it had come out before or after the 6p we wouldn’t be focusing so much on how much worse it is that it’s larger brother . previous nexus device manufacturers include htc, samsung, asus, lg and motorola but the the follow up, the nexus 6p is from huawei . why huawei? while huawei does world-wide and is a big force in the smartphone market, they’re not known for their fancy phones here in north america . while they make solid phones, i’m guessing most of their customers don’t even know they’re using a huawei phone . they appeal to that part of the market . so, a huawei nexus phone is a boon for them because it gets their name out . it also and helps potential customers become more comfortable spend more than $200 or $300 on a huawei phone . that said, the design of the front of the 6p is pretty bland . it actually matches the 5x with some minor changes so i’m guessing google mandated what they wanted the front of the phone to look like . they look so similar i sometimes have trouble telling them apart when i’m sorting through my pictures of each device . i’m going to go out on a limb here but i’ve found that google has never been known for their breath taking designs . that’s why they’re constantly changing their designs because they’re not timeless . then from huawei’s perspective the worst thing about the 6p is that it’s not very huawei-ish . don't get me wrong, it’s an amazing phone but at the same time it’s very generic . it may sell well but it doesn’t do too much to get their name out . i mean the huawei logo is on the back in relatively small lettering . the back and sides are one piece of metal . it’s quite nice . i like the chamfered finish on the corners of the sides . i don’t see any gaps but at the same time i don’t see any exposed screws so getting the 6p serviced may be an ordeal . it’s something to think about if you plan on keeping it for a few years as phone batteries in general begin to wear out after 2 or 3 years . note that this problem affects many phones and isn’t specific to the nexus 6p . still, the 6p is probably going to be a fairly popular phone so getting it serviced will probably not be too hard . i don’t normally comment on how a phone looks but the back of the 6p is pretty homely looking . i joke that it’s called the 6p because that’s how much huawei paid for the back’s design . the area on the camera is an attempt at balancing out the design but yet the camera is in the corner (where i personally prefer it) while the bottom has is covered with a piece of plastic with a different finish on it . then again, in all seriousness though, who really cares what the back looks like . if it’s ugly it just means it’s a good candidate for a case . just get a case with a nintendo gameboy or a cassette tape on it and you’re golden . there’s a fingerprint reader on the back . it’s circular so you just place your finger on it to use it . you don’t have to swipe . the idea is that your index finger is normally on the back of the phone when you’re picking it up so putting a reader there is the most logical choice . that’s the idea but for me i found it very inconvenient . first off, i tend to pick phones up by the bottom corner so my index finger is nowhere near the reader . i blame my use of iphones and samsung galaxy phones for this since i turn the phones on by using the home buttons . i guess if you’re used to phones that lack this then the reader might be more intuitive . secondly, the home and volume buttons are in the way so when reach for the reader i tend to hit those buttons which sometimes causes unexpected results . it makes me wish the buttons were either mounted higher up on the left side or if they were a bit stiffer . lastly, if you’re like me a tend to use their phone while it’s lying flat then the rear mounted reader will be annoying because you’ll need to pick it up to unlock it and then put it back down . in terms of performance and accuracy it’s comparable to my iphone 6s plus so it’s excellent . i do like how you can forgo the power button completely and just place your finger on the reader to turn it on and unlock it . i wish my galaxies and iphones did this . there are are stereo speakers in front . the headphone jack is located on top . note the usb type-c connector at the bottom . unlike microusb, usb-c can be inserted either way . it can also handle enough power so that it can be used to charge a laptop . that means eventually you’ll only need one type of cable for your laptop and your phone and tablet . usb-c is a nice upgrade but in the short term it's a bit of a headache if you have a large investment in microusb cables . first off if you like the convenience of having lots of cables around then you’ll need to re-buy them . since usb-c is still fairly new, chances are you’ll need to pay more for them than you did your microusb cables . the 6p comes with 2 usb-c cables, one has a regular sized usb connector on one end while the other has 2 usb-c connectors on both ends . i’m not sure if the metal body is to blame but wireless charging - a feature previously championed by nexus phones is missing from the 6p . does this mean that wireless charging in general is doomed . i personally own a wireless charging pad which i never use . i have a few problems with wireless charging: . first off, if i need to charge it’s usually because my battery is nearly depleted . if that’s the case it’s typically because i’ve been using my phone a lot - either i’ve been gaming or surfing the web a lot . when that happens i want to continue to use my phone . if i’m stuck with wireless charging it’s a bit harder to keep using my phone whereas if i have a cable i just attach it and keep going . secondly, i charge my phones on my night stand . i usually wait till the lights are off to plug my devices in . to me it’s easier to attach a cable than it is to find the sweet spot on a wireless charger . thirdly, using a wireless charger means you need to make space for it . between my phones, my glasses, alarm clock, and a bunch of other stuff i just don’t have room for this on my nightstand . i don’t think wireless charging is going anywhere but it still needs a few more generations before it will gain wider acceptance . once i’ve unlocked the 6p it’s a very easy phone to use . you don’t get any of the usability issues you get on many higher-end samsung phones . there’s just enough bezels on the side to give you something to hold onto without having to resort to putting part of your hand on the screen . the top and bottom are a bit taller than most phones but the stereo speakers are worth the extra space they take up . more importantly, the 6p is much easier to hold than the nexus 6 which is just a bit too wide . display: . you’d get a top-notch 5 . 7” 2560x1440 amoled display . it’s an excellent display . color looks good and viewing angles are excellent . you also get inky blacks . the only problem is that it turns blue when you view it off-angle though the problem isn’t as pronounced as it is on the note 5/gs6 edge+ . it’s very sharp and the super high resolution means the pentile pattern isn’t noticeable when you’re viewing solid colors . camera: . if i were to describe google’s nexus line up one of the first thing that comes to mind are ‘lousy’ cameras . either they came with cameras that were worse than competitors and or came with horrible camera software . anyways, the 6p fixes both these problems . google has revamped the camera software on the 6p . it’s much better than the one you get on the 6 (even after you upgrade it to marshmallow) . it’s focuses quickly with excellent shot-to-shot speeds . image quality has to be seen to be believed . colour and white balance are accurate . noise is really well controlled . it either has the best camera sensor when it comes to low light or it has the best and smartest noise reduction software . i love how you can quickly start the camera by double tapping the power button . i wonder if google “borrowed” this idea from the samsung gs6 (double tap the home button) and i hope that apple “borrows” this idea asap . more importantly, it’s a good camera in the real world when you’re doing stuff like chasing your kids around . you whip it out, double tap the power button, snap and you’re done . alas, while the 6p has a top-notch sensor, it lacks optical image stabilization which is a bit puzzling since its last 2 predecessors along with many competitors have this feature . still the nexus 6p is able to take great pics indoors despite the lack of stabilization . however, i can’t say the same thing about video . while video in general looks pretty good, the lack of ois means it has to rely heavily on digital stabilization which isn’t the same thing . video can get a little blurry as the 6p tries to compensate for shake . things get especially shaky if you’re walking around . the weirdest thing about the 6p’s video is that it doesn’t capture any detail in dark areas . software: . included is android 6 . 0 marshmallow . if you’re into android and software updates then google’s nexus phones are the ones to get . the 6p’s great, great grandfather, the nexus 4 received updates from google for closet to 3 years . more importantly, nexus devices are usually the first to receive updates . you don’t usually need to wait for your device manufacturer to wait while they re-skin android and give you your update a week before the next one comes out . to me, the most noticeable upgrade to 6 . 0 is built-in fingerprint reader support . i’ve been using readers since the iphone 5s and once you’ve used one it’s hard to go back to pin codes, passwords and unlocking patterns . i used to use pin codes religiously but now i find them a nuisance and can’t be bothered . a small change i noticed is that the 6p will tell you how fast it's charging (regular or fast charging) along with time remaining to full charge . it’s nice to know how fast it’s going when you’re using a new charger you’re not familiar with . by default, the 6p will only charge when you connect it to a computer . so if you want to transfer files you’ll need to go in and change it to mtp mode manually . there is finally a built-in file manager which is hidden in the storage & usb option in settings . you’ll have to scroll down to find it . some other changes which i had to look up include improved power management when you’re not using the phone . performance: . the 6p runs qualcomm’s snapdragon 810 soc . earlier this year it gained a bad rep for running too hot in the htc one m9 . indeed while it should be a jump from last year’s 805 and 801 soc, in the m9 it wasn’t much faster due to throttling . it could run faster in short spurts but then it would get too hot so it would have to slow itself down to give itself a chance to cool off . anyways, the 6p does get warm but it never gets hot . more importantly, compared to the m9, the 6p scores better and is better able to sustain its performance even after repeated benchmarking . is it because the 810 in the 6p is made with a more mature process so it doesn’t heat up as much? or is it just because the m9 is smaller (smaller phones heat up faster) . in absolute terms, while it’s faster than the one m9, it's still a step behind the soc in the samsung gs6/gs6 edge/gs6 edge+/note 5 . however pc mark shows that the 6 is actually faster . anyways, while the benchmarks are iffy, i find that the nexus 6p is consistently half a step quicker than the nexus 6 . games usually launch about 10% faster on the 6p plus it usually finishes drawing webpages first . the important thing to take away is that the 810 is able to handle the 6p’s quadhd display and still give you flagship performance . as a phone: . maximum earpiece volume is average, as is the speakerphone . incoming audio is very clean without sounding unnatural . rf performance is average . you get a large 3450mah battery . starting with this review i’m starting to test out battery life .  . i’m big on real world testing . as such, i’m setting each device to 50% brightness with auto-brightness turned on - just like they are when first turn them on . next i run the netflix app and play something (daredevil) while the device is connected to my 5gb 802 . 11ac network . i put each device in the corner of one of the desks in my office (it’s relatively bright in here) and leave some space around it . i also left an active sim in each device . i let netflix play for an hour and then record how much the battery has drained . next i extrapolated the drain into how long it would take to drain the battery from 100% down to 0 for easier readability . the test is real enough that i’m satisfied . the 6p lost about 12% during the hour while last year’s 6 lost 18% . in case you’re wondering, both are running android 6 . 0 (marshmallow) and are running the latest version of netflix available from google play at the time of this writing . not a bad showing . in future reviews i’ll have other phones to compare with . i’m also thinking of choosing a different show as the first episode of daredevil is pretty dark (brightness wise) which may unfairly favor amoled displays which consume less power when the screen is dark . media capabilities: . the top and bottom speakers provide front-facing stereo . they really come into their own when you’re watching movies or listening to music in landscape mode . it’s wide enough to provide noticeable channel separation when you’re holding it close by in landscape mode . they’re very powerful and have excellent sound quality . it’s so powerful that the 6p actually shakes . i don’t know this for a fact but my ears tell me there is some strong processing to provide some simulated surround sound . i don’t normally dig this sort of thing but on a pair of front facing speakers it’s actually a good thing . the speakers get lost in the specs but i think they’re actually one of the 6p’s best points . conclusion: . i guess it’s a given that each version of nexus gets better than the last but in the case of the 6p it’s a much bigger leap over its predecessor than its previous versions have been . on paper it’s not all that different but the 6p really improves on the previous one in almost all areas . the screen resolution is unchanged but it looks better . the speakers are improved, the battery is bigger and you can get it with more storage . however the biggest upgrade is the camera . previous nexus phones have never had great cameras plus they were usually crippled with google’s awful camera software . the 6p’s camera is such a leap forward it makes me completely re-think my opinions of nexus phones . really, aside from the inconveniently placed fingerprint reader, missing optical image stabilization and the lack of removable storage/battery the 6p doesn’t have any major weaknesses . if you’re looking for an android phone then the 6p is a must buy . the "p" could stand for perfection . i don’t use tablets very often . there are 2 main reasons why; first off, there’s no nice way to put it but when it comes to tablets, i’m a cheapskate . while i’m fine spending top dollar on a flagship phone, i’m hesitant to open my purse strings - sorry man’s bag - when it comes to a tablet . secondly, if i do get a tablet it must have lte . i’m too lazy to tether off my phone, it has too much of an impact on my battery plus i use way too much data to leave it on anyways . don’t even get me started as to how many days it takes me to realize i forgot to turn it off . however, lte usually commands quite a price premium - something my wallet is allergic to . my parsimonious purse strings purse strings simply won’t allow me drop a stack on a tablet with lte, i’d rather having no tablet than have an expensive one with lte . fortunately, zte’s grand x view might be just the answer for me . it's only a cheque book friendly $240 straight up on bell . i can dig that price . vs samsung galaxy tab a 8”: . for about the same price as the view you can can pick up a tab a 8” . first off, the tab a 8” i’m talking about has no lte which puts them in two different boats . lte makes a tablet so much more . sure, you could tether off your phone but i’ve always thought it was a bit of a hassle plus it can be bad for your wallet’s health if you forget to turn it off . on the upside, the tab a has a 4:3 ratio display which is where the market is currently trending .  . 16:9 works fine on phones because they need to be a little narrower so that they’re more friendly for one-handed use . however on a tablet, this isn’t a priority . on a tablet, 4:3 screens are well suited for surfing the web and reading text while 16:9 tablets like the zte are more optimised for watching video . i guess most people figured they’ll be watching lots of video on their tablet but ended up reading instead . screen resolution and possibly software updates aside, the zte is a much more compelling choice . first off, the tab a has an absolutely ragged looking 1024 x 768 display . remember the original ipad mini from a few years ago? it’s the same resolution as that . you can adjust the jagged looking display but you’ll always notice it . you could argue that it comes with a super amoled display but honestly, this doesn’t make any difference resolution-wise . secondly, the tab a only comes with 1 . 5gb of ram . i can imagine the struggle at samsung between designers who wanted to put a full 2gb of ram in the tab a and bean counters wanting to save $2 by only squeezing in 1 . 5gb . guess who won at samsung . the tab a comes with a more modest snapdragon 410 soc while the view comes with the speedier 615 . i haven’t tried the camera on the tab a . to be perfectly honest the camera on the view sucks - that said, i don’t know about you but i always use my phone to take pictures so to me, a camera is not an important feature on a tablet . as long as i have one i’m a happy camper . i guess for some businesses, this may be important so if that’s you, you should check out the tab a camera to see if it’s any good before making any decisions . anyways between the view and the tab, the zte wins by a landslide . vs lg g pad ii 8 . 0: . fido has the lg g pad ii 8 . 0 . full disclosure: i’ve only handled the pad briefly so i’m comparing mostly based on the specs and price . at a glance it looks like you’re getting a better badge for the same price but it’s not quite so simple . first off, the zte comes with a full hd 1920x1080 display while the lg makes do with a 1280x800 one . the difference in sharpness between a full hd and a hd display on a 8” screen is noticeable - this is the biggest difference between the 2 . the lg does come with a stylus which you probably won’t use . the more interesting feature is a full sized usb port . you can use it to connect your phone though i doubt most will do this . you can also use it to charge your phone but then again, power banks are dirt cheap these days . it would be easier to just get a power bank since it will be smaller and thus more portable . otherwise the zte is the obvious choice . along with the higher resolution screen it also comes with 2gb vs 1 . 5gb of ram and a more advanced snapdragon 615 soc vs the 400 series soc in the lg . body: . while not particularly stylish looking - it’s still a purposeful looking tablet . the body is plastic but it’s got a sturdy weighty feel to it . the buttons aren't flush but they could stick out just a tiny bit more . the charging port is offset . there are stereo speakers located on the top and bottom . the microsim and microsd slots are located behind a panel on the back . display: . the 8” 1920x1080 ips lcd is fairly sharp . it’s fairly bright with decent colour . viewing angles are so-so as are the black levels . often times i thought text and icons were a bit small . you can adjust the text size in the settings but this doesn’t really fix the problem . if you have problems seeing small text and want a tablet for its larger text the zte isn’t the greatest choice . camera: . the camera is pretty awful . it’s one of those cases where you the question isn’t whether the camera is good or not . it’s more a matter of “does it have a camera?” . having a camera is better than not having one at all . next question . software: . the view comes with android 5 . 0 out of the box . i haven’t heard anything one way or the other but i wouldn’t be surprised if it stays on 5 . 0 . it comes with zte’s overlay which is pretty basic . it mimics the iphone’s ui . instead of having the home screen with its icons and then the app drawer, it just has a home screen with icons . it also has customized pull down switches and settings menus . otherwise it’s a pretty simple overlay . the only other big change is that it comes with mmguardian which lets you lock the down zte which is nice if you have kids . performance: . you get a snapdragon 615, the same soc you’ll find on many mid-range phones like from the lg g4 vigor, sony xperia m4 aqua and motorola moto x play . it has incrementally better browsing performance and substantially better graphics performance compared to its little brother, the snapdragon 410 and 400 which you’ll find on competing samsung and lg tablets . the 615 is necessary since the zte has a 1920x1080 display . it basically allows the zte to offer similar levels of performance as a 410 powered device . since i haven’t had the chance to benchmark either samsung or lg tablets, i’ll sub the moto g 3rd gen . it has a display with similar resolution . it may only have 1gb of ram but any more then than has little effect on benchmarks . the lower resolution on the moto g benefit’s its graphics scores . lower resolution means less pixels to push which makes it easier on its soc . benchmarks don’t reveal this but the view feels a bit more pokey than other 615 devices i have lying around . its transitions feel a bit more choppy . i’m not sure if this is a result of the larger screen making choppiness more noticeable or what . sometimes it pauses too - is it the fault of the overlay . i guess the view could use a bit of tuning . anyways, it’s far from sexy but the 615 still provides adequate performance and is more than you’d expect at this price point . network performance and battery life: . i normally use voice calls to test rf performance so i didn’t test the zte’s as i normally would . i did have both it and a galaxy s6 edge+ connected to telus so i ran some speed tests . network signal isn’t very good in my basement so both devices dropped down to hspa . turns out the zte did very well with 10mbps downlink while the edge+ only managed 6mbps . the zte also stronger signal and higher signal quality . i didn’t bother testing lte because the edge+ has carrier aggregation (lte-a) while the zte doesn’t and will probably get higher scores . inside is a 4620mah battery which is a decent size for an 8" tablet . a largish battery is a boon for people who use their lte tablets for tethering . they can tether all day without having to worry about running out of juice . at maximum brightness the view can play about 5hrs of netflix videos . to be honest, i thought it would go a bit longer given the size of the battery . media capabilities: . i love how there are stereo speakers . they sound good and are fairly loud . they’re located on the top and bottom (or sides if you’re holding it in landscape) . you also get dolby sound which i’m not normally fond of but on the zte it actually makes it better . conclusion: . overall the grand x view provides sufficient specs, good enough components and lte with a can’t miss price tag . if tablets were ice cream then lte is hot fudge - they were made for each other . if you can afford the data charges and have enough ram, storage and resolution, then having lte is better than having more of the aforementioned specs . you can’t go wrong with the grand x view . when the iphone 6 plus was released last year is was the biggest change to apple’s iphone since the original model . up until then, for whatever reason, apple had resisted market trends and stuck with small screens for their iphones . with the 6 plus they jumped at least 2 sizes so suddenly, you didn't need to look elsewhere if you wanted a phone with large screen . the thing with the 6 plus though is that it wasn’t much of an improvement over the 5s in the processing power department . the problem with this is that since its soc was only marginally faster than its predecessor . so it didn’t really feel any faster . more importantly, just like its predecessors the 5s and 5, the 6 plus only comes with 1gb of ram while its competition comes with 2 to 4gb of ram which makes a big difference when you’re switching programs . while the iphone has usually enjoyed a performance advantage over its competition, the fact that the 6 plus wasn’t much faster than the 5s meant that they had a chance to catch up and in some cases, surpass it . so a jump in performance is sorely needed . let’s check out the 6s plus: . vs apple iphone 6 plus: . most of the differences between the 6 plus and the 6s plus lie under the hood . the most important is that there is now 2gb of ram . if i’ll be frank, apple should have thrown in 2gb of ram with the 5s but then again i’d also argue that apple should have unveiled a 5 . 5” display back then too . the soc is now faster to the point that the speed difference is noticeable . this isn’t some 20% increase that you’ll only see when they’re side-by-side . stuff like the fingerprint reader, camera app and apps now launch fast enough that you don’t have to compare . the camera is incrementally better . you get a more sensitive sensor which also captures more pixels so there’s no downside plus it can record 4k video . there’s 3d touch support, basically, the 6s plus knows how hard you’re touching it . as of right now it’s only useful with the built-in apps so it remains to be seen if this is a killer feature . i wouldn’t buy a phone solely for this feature yet because we need to see how it plays out first . if you have a 6 plus already i’d say hold off for the next version but if you have an older iphone, are thinking about upgrading and don’t mind the price tag them it’s a worthy upgrade . vs samsung galaxy note 5/s6 edge +: . i haven’t posted my s6 edge+ review yet but that and the note 5 are essentially the same phone . only the note has an s-pen stylus while the edge+ has a display that curves around the sides and a heftier price tag than its sibling . i guess first you have to decide whether you want the note 5 or the edge+ . to me, aside from being really cool, the curved edge doesn’t add any extra utility to the device . in fact, i think the curved edges makes the edge+ more difficult to handle . i just procrastinated from writing this and tried gaming on the edge+ and it was tough because there’s nothing to hold onto . anyways, the note 5 is only available with 32gb of storage - at least here in canada . 32gb is a good amount, it’s certainly way more useful than the base 6s plus’ 16gb of storage . the edge+ also has a more powerful speaker . both have incredible cameras, any differences between them is minor . the screens on them is a toss up . i prefer the colour on the iphone but some prefer the samsung amoled screens . i will say though that the iphone’s off angle performance is a lot better because it doesn’t turn blue like the note’s does . then again, the note’s blacks are much deeper . neither has a removable battery or storage so they’re both equally inept in this department . speaking of batteries, the note 5 (and edge+) support wireless charging (both qi and powermat) and both support fast charging (15 watt charger) so they have this advantage over the 6 plus which doesn’t support wireless charging and can only be charged at up to 12 watts . both are imminently capable but i prefer the iphone’s body just because it’s a easier to hold and use . really it’s a cost and ios vs android thing . if you’re already using ios there’s no real compelling reason to switch to android unless you’re tired to exorbitant apple prices and are okay with samsung’s merely expensive price tags . if you’re currently on android, apple now has an app on google play to help you switch to an iphone . body: . at a glance they appear identical but the 6s plus is actually a tiny bit bigger than 6 plus . if you’re trying to re-use your 6 plus case on a 6s plus it might fit but it won’t fit well so chances are you’ll have to buy a new one . take the 6s plus leather and silicon cases from apple . they updated them so that they fit the 6s plus . since they fit the 6s plus they also fit the 6 plus since they’re almost the same size . however, the older case for the 6 plus sort of fits the 6s plus but it doesn’t wrap around the sides as well . the fit is off enough that i broke down and bought a new case rather than reuse my 6 plus case . otherwise it’s just like the 6 plus . the buttons are very tactile and a joy to press . it’s a very thin phone, one of the skinniest around . this makes it a good choice if you’re going to use a case . apparently the 6s plus has been strengthened so it’s more resistant to bending . then again, skinny jeans aren’t quite as in now so i guess maybe  . the bezel is relatively thick - i personally don’t have a problem with this since it makes it easier to handle . display: . you still get a 5 . 5” 1920x1080 display .  . while they have identical specs, the 6s plus’ has a different calibration - to my eyes its whites are a bit warmer . otherwise the displays are pretty similar . at 401ppi it’s not quite as sharp as some quad hd android flagships but as someone who uses phones with these displays regularly (lg g4, gs6 edge+, nexus 6, etc), i never notice any difference so it’s only an advantage on paper . colour is nice and restrained . actually the 6s plus might be a tiny bit more saturated . blacks are identical to the 6 plus which makes it one of the better lcd’s in this regard . viewing angles and outdoor performance are identical and still right up there with the best . one new feature is 3d touch, with it the 6 plus can sense how hard you’re touching the screen . generally you can press a little harder to preview content . for example when you’re viewing the picture gallery, you can tap the screen harder to enlarge previews . for now it only works with the built-in apps so the jury is out on how useful it will be . when you use 3d touch the 6s plus can use the vibration motor to make it feel like you’ve actually pressed the screen . remember the old blackberry storm 2 or motorola rokr e8 from 6 years ago? it’s like that - you’ll swear that the screen moved when you pressed it even though it didn’t . i personally don’t use the built-in apps often so i didn’t encounter many opportunities to use 3d touch . oh and in case you’re wondering, yes it does work through screen protectors . i’m still investigating but so far it seems to work through both glass and plastic . camera: . the last 4 generations of iphone have all come with 8 megapixel cameras . while the resolution has remained static, the image quality has improved each generation . the problem with an 8 megapixel sensor is that it doesn’t have enough pixels for 4k video . android phones have been able to record 4k video for close to 2 years now so apple had to offer this feature sooner or later . as such, the 6s plus camera receives a resolution bump and now boasts 12 megapixels which is more than enough for 4k . there’s a new live photo function which snaps a quick 3 second video clip to go with each photo . it’s pretty much the same as htc’s zoe feature which came out 3 years ago . while it sounds interesting in practise i turned this feature off - just like i did on the htc one m7, m8 and m9 . in ios 9 apple changed the camera app interface a little so you can no longer choose the slow-mo video speed from the app . you have to go to the settings app instead to change this . i preferred the old way of doing this as sometimes i wanted to slow things down a little and other times a lot . better yet, i’d like to see variable speed control in 30 fps increments . i love how responsive the camera is along with its outstanding image quality . my only complaint is that i wish the macro performance was a bit better . don’t get me wrong, it’s one of the best around but the gs6 and g4 can get even closer . despite the bump in resolution the new camera has better low light performance with less noise . so in essence, the extra pixels are “free”, you don’t give up anything to get them . you can now capture video in 4 different modes; 4k, 1080p @60fps, 1080p @30fps and 720p . aside from taking up more space, there doesn’t seem to be a penalty to using the 4k mode . i assumed 4k video would sacrifice some low-light performance but that doesn’t seem to be the case . thanks to the faster processor, switching between picture and video mode is noticeable faster . the front-facing camera now has 5 megapixels up from the 1 . 2mp sensor on the 6 plus . it captures more detail and supports a selfie flash where it lights up the screen to help illuminate your face . it’s different than the selfie flash on the lg g3, where it just lights up the sides of the screen . software: . out of the box the 6s plus runs ios 9 . i talk about software updates all the time and when it comes to apple, they’re the kings of of this . ios 9 is available on devices as old as the iphone 4s - a device which was first released almost 4 and a half years ago . the 4s’ contemporary, the galaxy nexus was released 6 months after the 4s and stopped receiving updates over a year and a half ago . so while apple makes no promises, there’s a good chance the 6s plus will receive updates for many years to come . some newer android devices are getting better - some of the getting updates for 2 years or more but they still have a way to go . while many generations of iphones are able to run ios 9, certain ios 9 features aren’t available on older devices . some features exclusive to the 6s series include the 4k video i mentioned, 3d touch support and the ability to use the keyboard as a mouse when selecting text . i don’t use safari myself but it now supports 3rd party add ons like ad blockers . i guess this is apple’s way of getting more people to use safari/stick it to google with content publishers like yours truly in the middle . i also noticed that ios in generally is now more location aware . when i’m out, it bugs me every now and then to remind me how traffic is and long it would take to get home . when you bring up the task switcher it sometimes recommends apps i might want to open based on where i am . for example, if i’m at shopper drug mart (think a smaller more expensive walgreens or maybe duane reade in canada) there’s a link to the app when i switch tasks . the keyboard has received some updates . first off, the keyboard keys finally show if you’re typing in lowercase instead of always being upper case . it only took apple about 8 years to fix this . they also made it easier to move the cursor around . pressing and holding the keyboard allows you to slide the cursor around around like a mouse when you’re typing . note that it’s just for text, it doesn’t allow you to surf web pages like you would on a computer . performance: . the 6 plus was only a minor improvement over the 5s in the processing power department . i guess apple usually focuses more on the exterior for number changes and more on the inside with their corresponding ‘s’ versions . the 6s plus doesn’t deviate from this strategy as its a9 soc is a substantial improvement over the a8 in the performance department . indeed, the 6s plus is a big jump up from the 6 plus but how does this translate into real life . well, apps launch more quickly but the thing is, the 6 plus isn’t exactly slow so it’s a case of fast vs faster with the 6s plus . one of my favorite games, plants vs zombies 2 usually takes a while to launch . on the 6 plus it takes around 27 seconds while on the 6s plus it takes about 22 seconds . most regular apps on the other hand already launch fairly quickly on the regular model so difference between it and the 6s plus isn’t as noticeable . i don’t know about you but when it comes to my 6 plus last year i remember its camera launching much faster than it does now . is it a case of it actually taking longer or is it just a case of me getting used to phones like the gs6 and it’s siblings which are all capable of pulling up their cameras even faster . anyways, the 6s plus can launch its camera a hair faster than the gs6 though once you take into account the samsung’s double tap home button to launch they’re essentially equal . another area which is a welcome improvement is the touchid . the fingerprint reader on the 6 plus isn’t exactly slow but there was a noticeable gap between it and the speedier gs6 . the 6s plus regains the lead in the fingerprint reader sprint - it’s now almost instantaneous . practically speaking, it's so fast that if subsequent versions add more speed the difference won’t be as noticeable unless you have them side by side . next they need to improvement when my fingers are wet . really, the biggest difference between the 2 iphones is that the 6s plus comes with 2gb of ram . this actually makes far more of a difference than the faster processor does . the 6 plus is constantly re-launching programs because it only has enough ram to keep one large program open at a time along with a couple of small ones . when i’m gaming and get a new message i have to weigh whether i want to risk losing some of my progress in order to respond . you see, switching to my messaging app and then possibly clicking a link may be enough for the 6 to close my game in order to free up some memory . the 6s plus comes with 2gb of ram which by the way, has be de rigueur on android for close to 4 years now . or rather, i should say, the 6s plus finally comes with 2gb of ram . 2gb of ram is enough to play games, check messages and do some light browsing without having to relaunch anything . to me this is the biggest difference between between the 6 and 6s plus . if you’re using a 5s and have been waiting for a faster iphone then it’s time for the 6s and 6s plus . as a phone: . maximum earpiece and speakerphone volume are unchanged from the 6 plus . i’m very disappointed by this as the android competition has surpassed the iphone in this regard - especially samsung - the gs6 and it’s siblings’ earpiece and speakerphones are all significantly louder than the iphone . rf performance is unchanged from the 6 plus so it’s just average . apple has shrunk the battery from 2915mah on the 6 plus down to a reported 2750mah on the 6s plus . they’re confident that the new a9 soc is efficient enough to offset the drop in battery capacity . the way i see it is that a loss in capacity is never a good thing . even if the claimed battery life is identical, it’s one of those things you can never have enough of . then again, i guess they needed to shrink it since the 6s plus is slightly larger than the 6 plus . if you have your phone on silent a lot (like myself), you should know that the vibration motor is much stronger . i guess one reason why it’s louder is because the 3d touch feature needs something very responsive to provide the haptics . media capabilities: . the single speaker on the bottom hasn’t changed . it sounds decent and is just as loud as the 6 plus . that said, it’s android competition has taken huge leaps forward - this is the area where android really pulls ahead of the iphone . phones like the lg g4 sound even better and are much, much louder . like its predecessors, the base model 6s plus only comes with 16gb of storage which as as far as i’m concerned a travesty . 16gb is fine on a device that costs $200-300 but on a phone that starts at close to $1000 should come with a minimum of 32gb of storage . the problem with 16gb is that if you actually use your iphone, it’s very easy to fill that space up very quickly . install a few large games, snap some 4k video and you’re full . don’t forget that you need to keep enough free space to allow for updates . conclusion: . i’m a bit conflicted about the 6s plus . on one hand, the extra ram really transforms the iphone’s user experience . the boost in speed is also a welcome as is the improved camera which can shoot 4k video . on the other hand, android flagships have had more than 2gb of ram for years now . you could argue that ios is more frugal with ram but the thing is, iphone has been really lagging in this area so apple is merely playing catch up and still lags by a little bit . ditto for 4k video which has been on android for over 2 years now . as for the 3d touch, i don’t typically use the built-in apps much so right now, for me it’s not a feature i use at all . while it’s definitely cool, it’s going to take time for it to be truly useful . then there’s the price . in canada, my 6s plus 128gb cost a breathtaking $1289 before taxes . you could almost get 2 lg g4’s for that price . i tell you, while i like my iphone, i don’t feel really good when i think about how much i paid for it . i’ve been reviewing a lot of $250-$400 phones lately and for good reason; with phones like the moto x play, asus zenfone 2 and alcatel onetouch idol 3, this segment of the market is just red hot with competition . not to be left out, sony has their $300 locked on bell and virgin, xperia m4 aqua which brings a very uncommon but very practical feature - water resistance . let’s check it out . vs alcatel onetouch idol 3: . for the same money you can pick up one of my favs, the idol 3 . both have 5” displays, 13 megapixels cameras, snapdragon 615 soc’s, 2gb of ram and 16gb of storage . the idol pulls ahead with a full hd (1080p) display while the sony’s is a more pedestrian hd (720p) . it also has stereo speakers which sound better and an beefy 3000mah battery . on the other hand, the m4’s speakers, while not quite as good, are still pretty damn impressive in their own right . however, the m4’s key advantage is it’s water resistant . that plus the speaker make for a great combination in the shower . i’d personally pick the idol 3 but you can’t go wrong with either . the idol’s screen looks better and is noticeably sharper but the m4’s water resistance is a very practical feature . vs motorola moto x play: . while $100 dearer, the moto also has a larger, higher resolution display . the difference between them is noticeable - the moto noticeably sharper and bigger . ditto for the speakers and camera both of which are a bit better . it also has a 3630mah battery which is over 50% larger than the sony’s . as for updates, sony has a mixed record with updating their phones . they’ve been really, really good with their flagships  . the sony has is 3 key advantages, water resistance, a slimmer body and most importantly a lower price tag . i’d say if you can swing it go, for the moto but if every penny counts, then the m4 is also a smart choice . vs asus zenfone 2 16gb: . then there’s the zenfone 2; it has a faster soc, a larger, sharper display, dual sim cards both of which are unlocked, bigger battery and a price tag that’s $50 cheaper . the sony counters with water resistance, a louder and better sounding speaker and a sleeker design . these are all important points but if you can look past this then the zenfone offers more for less money . body: . the m4’s body looks a lot like sony’s other recent flagships with a smooth front and back . it doesn’t feel quite as fancy though - the back appears to be plastic . it actually bends if you press in . the body also flexes quite a bit when you twist it . this worries me a bit since the m4 is water resistance - will putting in your back pocket and sitting on it too many times compromise the water resistance . for what it’s worth, i twisted the m4 a few times . it was able to survive repeated rounds of me singing in the shower afterwards, my wife’s ears on the other hand, were not so lucky . there are volume, power and a camera button half way down the right side . i kind of wish the buttons stuck out a tiny more but then again, this makes the m4 easier to handle . otherwise, is the m4 is comfortable to hold and easy to use . note that the m4’s headphone jack and microusb don’t have covers on them . the ports themselves are water tight . you no longer need to fiddle around with a port cover everytime you want to connect headphones or charge it . bravo . the microsd port is located under a door on the left side . the nano sim card goes on the right and is also behind a door . display: . the m4 has a 5” 1280x720 display . most of the competition is rocking 1920x1080 resolutions these days so this is the m4’s greatest weakness . the difference in sharpness between a 5 . x” 1920x1080 display and the m4’s is noticeable .  . color is pleasant, off-angle performance is excellent . it’s also great outdoors . the only other problem is that black levels aren’t very deep . if you’re not happy with the colour, you can adjust it manually via 3 sliders . camera: . on the back is a 13 megapixel camera with autofocus and a led camera flash . i’m pleased that one of my favorite sony features, the dedicated camera button made it on to the m4 . to start the camera, you just press and hold the button . you can half press it to focus or all the way to snap a picture . by default it tries to guess the best settings - low light, action, portrait, that sort of thing . i guess other cameras do this but the sony software really makes sure you know it’s doing its best . some features from higher-end camera models include some dedicated shooting modes including a nifty augmented reality which puts dinosaurs into your shot (yes, i did just type that) . another cool one is the ability to shoot video and sync up video on 2 phones simultaneously . of course, you’ll need a supported sony phone . image quality is good for the price point . more importantly, the camera is relatively capable so you don’t have to take as many shots to get a decent one . video quality on the other hand is pretty awful . by default steadyshot - really strong digital image stabilization is turned on and it just smears everything and results in unusable video . however, once you turn it off, you’ll still notice that video doesn’t look all that great - even when you’re outdoors and there’s plenty of light . the microphone isn’t all that great either . i suspect there’s too much noise reduction going on . software: . the m4 i’m using is running android 5 . 0 . some of the competition like the moto x play (which came out after the m4) is running 5 . 1 . hopefully sony won’t forget about the m4 . you appear to get the same overlay you’d find on sony’s flagship devices including their small apps which hover over your other apps so that you can use multiple apps simultaneously . it’s a different approach from samsung and lg in that you can access the app drawer without having to relaunch the apps you’re currently using . like samsung and lg, the small apps feature only works with a handful of programs . performance: . performance is in line with what you’d expect from a snapdragon 615 . the 615 in the moto x play is clocked a little higher so its scores are correspondingly higher . i did notice that the m4 can get quite hot close to the camera when i was setting it up - i’m talking close to 140f hot . it’s hot enough that the m4 has to throttle processor speed when i was benchmarking . i know this because placing the m4 in my freezer running a whole bunch a couple back-to-back on my desk resulted in a 20% difference in scores . i also suspect this may be a reason why the m4 wasn’t able to complete all the benchmarks i wanted to on it . you know how i complained that the display could have used higher resolution? well, one area where this is a plus is when it comes to gaming performance .  . the zenfone 2 on the other hand has an intel z3560 soc which has different cores and gpu both of which are substantially more powerful than the m4’s . in fact, the zenfone’s soc compares favorably with qualcomm’s snapdragon 801 . yeah, the 801 is 2 years old now but there’s still a considerable gap between it and the 615 . practically speaking, the 615 does feel a bit slower than the intel and the 801 but you need to use phones with each soc to really appreciate the difference . occasionally, sometimes screen redraws stutter a tiny bit but most of the time the 615 feels snappy . i’d say performance is more than adequate . i know this personally because i switch between a regular lg g4 and some snapdragon 615 phones all the time and i rarely complain about the drop in performance . as a phone: . maximum earpiece and speakerphone volume are both average . rf performance is average . you get a 2400mah battery . the battery is a tad small while the display is quite bright so power users will need to find a plug halfway through the day . casual users will probably make it through the day . media capabilities: . there’s a single speaker at the bottom right . it’s fairly powerful and sounds like it’s received a moderate amount of tuning . it’s not quite as good as the idol 3 or moto x play’s but it does run circles around the zenfone 2 . you get around 11gb of storage which is plenty . if you need more you can pop a microsd in the left side of the phone . conclusion: . overall, i enjoyed using the m4 . while i wish the screen was a tad sharper, it’s still sharp enough that i don’t notice it most of the time . otherwise, for the price the m4 is a well rounded phone . it’s pleasant to use and offers a good mix of features and more importantly, it doesn’t have any serious weaknesses . one of my favorite phones of 2015 is the lg g4 . it’s a fantastic all-around package with no significant weaknesses . more importantly, the fact that samsung removed some key features from the gs6 and then hiked the price makes the g4 a no-brainer . still, while the g4’s price is reasonable, it still sports a flagship price tag . fortunately, if you don’t want to fork out too much dough, there are now more choices than ever when it comes to mid-range phones . here’s the lg g4 vigor, which possesses some of the g4’s qualities but comes with a much more palatable $350 can price tag . vs alcatel onetouch idol 3: . for the same money on virgin, you can pick up an idol 3 . the vigor has a slightly bigger 5 . 2” display, removable battery plus it’s a more solid phone and you could argue that it also has a better badge . you also get a newer version of android 5 . 1 vs 5 . 0 though if and when either device receives further updates remains to be seen . however, the idol has a tremendous advantage in most other areas; most importantly, it has nearly 3x as much storage available when you first boot it up . while you have to do a bit of work to fill the idol, the vigor essentially comes with almost no free space . this reason alone is why the vigor is going to lose out on almost any comparison . lg just set it up to fail . the idol also has 2gb of ram vs 1 . 5gb on the vigor, much more powerful speakers and a much larger, albeit non-removable battery . vs motorola moto x play: . for $50 more, you can pick up a moto x play . like the idol, it has nearly 3x as much free space . that alone makes it a smarter buy . it also has a battery which is nearly 60% larger, a slightly larger display, better camera and comparable build quality . motorola has also been very good about keeping their phones updated . you could say the same thing about lg but that’s more for their flagships only . the only thing the vigor has going for it is a slightly lower price tag and a removable battery . you could mention the laser autofocus and colour sensor too but i don’t find either feature makes a big difference . vs motorola moto x 2014: . you can get last year’s moto x unlocked for $50 more from staples . while it may be last year’s model, its snapdragon 801 soc is quite a bit more powerful than the 615 in the vigor . its metal body is also quite a treat as is the powerful speaker . most importantly, the x comes with a very usable 16gb of storage plus it will probably receive an android 6 . 0 update eventually . the vigor does have a removable battery and memory card . it may cost more but i’d say it’s worth the extra $50 . vs asus zenfone 2 64gb: . add $30 and the zenfone 2 becomes available . you know how i’ve been whining about how the the vigor only comes with 3 . 5gb of free storage? well the zenfone 2 comes with around 55gb of free storage, that’s nearly 15x more .  . the camera is slightly better plus you get a much larger battery (3000 vs 2300) and its soc is a bit more powerful . in also comes with a whopping 4gb of ram - my calculator says that’s nearly 3x as much as the vigor - ouch . i haven’t even gotten to the sim card yet or rather sim cards . you get dual sims (one is 2g only) plus the asus is also unlocked . sadly, the only things the vigor has going for it is a better badge, much higher build quality, a better speaker and a removable battery . it also currently comes with a more recent version of android (5 . 1 vs 5 . 0) . lg really needs to add more storage to the vigor (bundle a memory card) and a price cut down to $220 ish . body: . the body is a dead ringer for the lg g4 (the “regular” one) . it looks exactly the same, has a curved display and the back has the same interesting pattern on it . the g4’s body may be plastic but it’s a very solid and high quality one . the vigor is no different so right off the bat, this is a key advantage over some of the competition . like the g4, there is a microsd (common at this price point) and a removable battery (less common at all price points) . the vigor also gets the g4’s rear mounted volume and power buttons . this setups has its pros and cons; it does make the g4 very easy to handle but at the same time it can be inconvenient if you’re used to side mounted power and volume buttons . then again, lg makes it so you can double tap the screen to turn the g4 on or double tap the top of the screen to turn it off . the back cover has the same diamond pattern/hammer metal finish that you’ll find on the g4 though they left out the extra g4-esque leather back . behind the back cover is a 2300mah battery along with the microsd and micro sim slots . it’s hard to tell but the vigor has a curved display - just like the g4 . the curve is so slight, i never noticed it till i was editing pictures of it but it’s definitely there .  . it’s a comfortable phone to use . the back is curved both up-and-down and side-to-side . display: . you get a 5 . 2” 1920x1080 curved lcd display . it looks great and is comparable to what you’d find on a flagship albeit with less pixels . still, while there are less pixels, it doesn’t look any less sharp than say its bigger brother the g4 . while the g4 backs more pixels, there are so many that you won’t notice the difference so it’s an advantage on paper only . viewing angles are great, black levels are good and colour looks accurate . it also works well outdoors . practically speaking, to my eyes the only difference between the vigor’s display and a flagship is that flagships are typically a tiny bit brighter . overall, it’s an excellent display and one of the vigor’s best features . camera: . there’s an 8 megapixel camera on the back with a f/2 . 4 lens . it comes with lg’s laser autofocus plus their color sensor . the laser autofocus sounds cool but i’ve found it has very limited range so i question what utility it brings to the table . same with the color sensor, while i’m sure it helps the vigor’s white balance, i don’t find it makes it any better than the competition . one treat is that the camera software includes the g4’s manual mode including: . white balance . manual focus . exposure . iso . shutter speed . exposure lock . the vigor handles well, the shutter button is easy to press and it focuses fairly quickly . image quality is okay . there’s a bit too much noise reduction but i guess the flip side is that indoors pictures look quite clean though some fine detail is missing . video quality is also decent but the microphone sounds a bit muffled at times . since the vigor doesn’t come with a lot of free space, it shoots video at 720p by default though there is a 1080p setting too . if you’re going to use the camera, make sure you get a microsd . software: . you get android 5 . 1 along with lg’s user interface layer . i don’t usually mind manufacturer overlays but the vigor doesn’t come with a lot of storage so in this case, every mb counts . still, it’s pretty straight forward, the biggest changes are that there’s support for the double tap to turn on or off feature and the knock patterns to unlock your phone . i noticed two features on the regular g4 that are missing from the vigor . first off, the split screen feature which lets you view certain apps 2 at the same time is missing . kid mode, where you can set a custom knock code for your kids is also mia . otherwise it’s a pretty straight forward overlay . you get the usual stuff like a custom gallery app, video player, etc . they didn’t include tons of extra apps probably because there isn’t any room for them . performance: . performance is in line with what you’d expect from a snapdragon 615 . the fact that the vigor only has 1 . 5gb while the competition has 2gb doesn't really make any difference to these tests . that said, the extra ram comes into play if you multitask a lot and like to jump from app to app frequently . the 615 in the moto x play is clocked a little higher so its scores are correspondingly higher . the zenfone 2 on the other hand has an intel z3560 soc which has different cores and gpu both of which are substantially more powerful than the vigor’s . in fact, the zenfone’s soc compares favorably with qualcomm’s snapdragon 801 . yeah, the 801 is 2 years old now but there’s still a considerable gap between it and the 615 . practically speaking, the 615 does feel a bit slower than the intel and the 801 but you need to use phones with each soc to really appreciate the difference . occasionally sometimes screen redraws stutter a tiny bit but most of the time the 615 feels snappy . i’d say performance is more than adequate . i know this personally because i switch between a regular lg g4 and some snapdragon 615 phones all the time and i rarely complain about the drop in performance . as a phone: . the maximum earpiece and speakerphone volumes are both average . rf performance is average . you get a 2300mah battery, given the size of the screen it’s slightly undersized . it will last the day for casual users but power users will probably need to top off halfway through the day . then again, power users won’t be able to live with a phone with 4gb of storage so i guess that point is moot . media capabilities: . the rear mounted speaker sounds decent but it’s volume is merely adequate . it’s not ear splittingly powerful like its bigger brother the g4 . i mentioned this many times but it’s worth mentioning again, the vigor only has 3 . 5gb of free space when you turn it on for the first time . yes, 3 . 5gb, just like you’d expect from a no-name throwaway android phone . if you plan on storing any sort of media on it you should do yourself a favour and pick up a microsd . when i first started using the vigor, i was getting out of space messages about 30 minutes after - it’s that bad . conclusion: . the vigor has some really nice features - it brings a flagship level display and build quality to the table for under $350 can . however, all that is overshadowed by the fact that it comes with a bargain basement 3 . 5gb of free space . i mean its competitors ship with a minimum of 16gb (around 11gb free) and up to 64gb (around 57gb free) . i often talk about how well rounded a phone is and unfortunately, the vigor just has a big flaw . why lg would handicap their phone like this is a total mystery . still, even if it came with 8 or 16gb of storage, it’s still a bit overpriced since it only comes with 1 . 5gb . in the end, the vigor could have been a great device if lg didn’t hold it back so much . consumers have been spend less money on computers and more on their mobile phones . this has given companies like acer, which is a big name in computers, a challenging time . while they’ve had some mobile phone offerings, they haven’t gained much traction in the market . as such, it’s been awhile since i’ve tried one . here’s their latest offering; the acer liquid jade z . at $269 . 99 can unlocked, it’s a high-entry/low-midrange phone . spec-wise you get a 5” hd display, quad-core 64 bit processor, 2gb ram, 16gb storage, 13 megapixel camera with lte so on that front, it's promising . let’s check it out: . vs motorola moto g 2015: . for $70 less you can pick up a locked 2015 moto g . the jade has slightly beefier hardware; the soc is incrementally more powerful while the gpu pulls ahead but quite a bit . you also get double the storage which comes in handy if you download a lot of apps or take a lot of pictures . the extra ram is also a boon if you multitask a lot . another wild card is that the liquid comes with support for dual sims plus it’s unlocked . both camera sensors have 13 megapixels but at f/1 . 8 the acer’s has a wider aperture while the motorola counters with a dual tone flash (and a not too shabby f/2 . 0 lens) . neither camera is outstanding but both can give serviceable pictures so it’s a bit of a wash here . the motorola counters with its water resistance, much better sounding speakers and frequent android updates . at the same time, i’m kind of shocked that acer is shipping the liquid with android 4 . 4 . 4 . based on previous acer phones i don’t expect one major upgrade after a long time but otherwise, the jade probably won’t to get much action . i hope acer proves me wrong . really it boils down to this: the motorola is a water resistant phone with better speakers and frequent updates . the acer gives you more ram, more storage (both of which will make a difference), dual sim support, it’s unlocked out of the box but you’ll probably never be on the cutting edge when it comes to having the latest version of android . it’s a tough choice because both phones are a bit flawed . the moto is too skimpy with the ram and storage while the acer costs a bit more and ships with last year’s version of android . vs zte grand x 2: . the grand x 2 is an even bigger headache for the liquid because you can get similar specs for $120 less . attachment 130240 . the soc is almost as powerful, you also get a 5” hd display, 16gb of ram, 2gb of storage, lte and a microsd . so what do you get for the extra $120? the camera isn’t quite as good as the acer’s . you also get a phone that’s locked and can only support one sim card (you’ll have to figure out if these 2 features are worth paying for . the real kicker is that the zte ships with android 5 . 1 out of the box . vs asus zenfone 2 1 . 8ghz: . the biggest headache for the jade is that for you can get an asus zenfone 2 for the same money . the zenfone has a bigger, higher resolution display, bigger battery, more powerful soc, a newer version of android and a better camera . other than being a lot lighter and have a more interesting finish on the back, the acer is going to need a big price cut if it hopes to compete with the zenfone 2 . vs alcatel onetouch idol 3: . for $50 more, the alcatel onetouch idol 3 is another migraine for the jade . the idol 3 is more powerful than the acer, has a better, bigger, higher resolution but the best thing about alcatel is that it has a really amazing set of speakers . body: . when i opened the box for the first time i spent a few seconds looking for the battery but couldn’t locate one . turns out the jade is just a really light phone . at 110g, it’s much lighter than the 2015 moto g (155g) and the asus zenfone 2 (170g albeit with a bigger screen) . it seems the jade’s lightness comes at the expense of some rigidity . while i wouldn’t go so far as to say it feels cheap, it does flex a little bit more when you twist it . then again, how often do you twist your phone in everyday usage . that said, it lacks that heft you get with some phones so it takes a bit of adjusting . i did notice that the glass on the lens got some scratches on it . i have no idea how this happened but i’m very disappointed because i was pretty careful with the acer . the back is rounded so it’s quite comfortable to hold . it also has a very interesting canvas pattern on it . while it’s just molded hard plastic, it’s still cool to look at it it feels unique . while i liked how the buttons stuck out, for some reason acer decided to put the power button on top of phone . still, since the back is rounded the top is easier to reach than most other phones . at night you can see the backlight through cracks near the volume buttons . does this mean dust will get in through there? i can’t say for certain but in the couple days i’ve had it i don’t see any dust under the screen (knock on wood) . the back cover isn’t removable so there’s a sim card tray . i love how you don’t need to find a paper clip to pop it open . you just pull it out with your fingernail . check out the sim card tray . it can either hold a nano sim and a microsd or 2 nano sims . display: . as is becoming standard, you get a 5” 1280x720 lcd ips display . at 290ppi, you will see a bit of jaggedness occasionally but overall, it’s a pretty sharp screen . these days i haven’t seen a phone with a lousy display in quite some time . in absolute terms it’s a good display so any complaints are pretty minor . straight on it looks good . colour is decent as are black levels . maximum brightness is average and it works well outdoors . off-angle it loses a bit of brightness . camera: . the rear camera has a resolution of 13 megapixel autofocus camera with a f/1 . 8 lens . it’s a bit wider than average . most camera phones have lenses of f/2 . 0 to f/2 . 8 . the flash on the back isn’t dual tone like the ones on the moto g and zenfone 2 . the camera starts, focuses and captures pictures quickly . image quality isn’t terrible but the zenfone 2’s sensor is more sensitive and less noisy . video is recorded at 1080p . video looks fine . the microphone captures reasonable audio but it does pick up handling noise . software: . while competitors ship with android 5 . 1, acer decided to ship the jade with android 4 . 4 . 4 . in case you didn’t know, after android 4 . 4 is 5 . 0 so it’s already 2 versions out of date . if having a very updated version of android is important to you, then get a zenfone 2 or a moto g, those 2 receive regular updates . still, i wouldn't’ be surprised if the jade z received a 5 . 1 update eventually - probably when everyone else is running something even newer . like asus, acer tries to replicate the pc bloatware experience with many, many extra apps . to be fair, some of the apps are pretty cool . the “ab”, starts for “acer byoc” where the “c” stands for computer . they’re a set of apps that allow the liquid to access files on your computer . abdocs allows you to edit word documents on your computer, abmusics lets you listen to music on your computer, that sort of thing . with abfiles you can browse your computer’s file system and manage files including downloading them to your phone . the ab apps are actually pretty cool but i wish acer consolidated all of them into one app so they don’t take up so much space on the menu . in case you’re wondering, acer extend isn’t some sort of android powered male enhancement supplement, rather it allows you to control your phone using your computer . the problem with it is that you have to enable usb debugging - if you’re not an android nerd you’ll have to figure out how to do this . go to “settings” -> “about phone” and then tap the build number field repeatedly to become a developer . then go back and you’ll notice there is now a “developer options” option . choose that and then select “usb debugging” . further, if you want to connect via wifi you need to open the program on your computer, open the app on the phone and then click “on” . this isn’t a bad idea from a security perspective but it does make it slightly complicated to use . once you’ve got it running it’s pretty cool . another neat feature are float apps, while a few other companies have this feature it’s nice to see it on a more affordable device like the acer . you can launch the browser, calculator, camera, maps, notes and watch in a window that floats on top of your other apps . while it’s a bit top-heavy, some of the built-in apps are interesting . performance: . the liquid’s powerplant is a mediatek mt 6732 soc . it has four 64bit cortex-a53 cores clocked at 1 . 5ghz . if you’re keeping track, snapdragon 410 in the moto g 2015 has the same cores but they only run at 1 . 4ghz . the difference is that the mediatek’s graphics processor is a mali t760 while the snapdragon 410 has an adreno 306 which according to my tests, is not quite as powerful . the zenfone 2 has an intel z3560 soc which has different cores and gpu both of which are substantially more powerful than the liquid’s . the snapdragon 615 in the idol 3 yields scores which are the most similar to the mt6732 . as a phone: . the earpiece and speakerphone maximum volumes are both below average . rf performance is also below average . if you make a lot of calls you’ll want to look for a different phone . the battery should last most people the day . there is support for dual nano sims . media capabilities: . the speaker isn’t very powerful but if you listen carefully, it does sound like it’s been tuned - however, the speaker itself is nothing to write home about so you’re left with middling results . there’s a dts feature which you can turn on or off . turning it on does make a difference but like i said, you’re left with middling results . you get 16gb of storage (around 11gb usable) - which isn’t too bad . if you need more you can add a microsd . just keep in mind that the second nano sim card slot is shared with the microsd . you have to choose one or the other . like other dual sim phones, the second sim (the one shared with the microsd) is 2g only which limits you to gsm/gprs/edge operators like rogers, t-mobile, at&t . conclusion: . in the end, the acer liquid jade z is doomed from the start because for $20 less, you can get an asus zenfone 2 . i guess if acer cut the price down to $200 it would be more competitive but even then it’s an increasingly crowded price point . the zenfone 2 can do everything better than the jade can . off the top of my head, the only advantage that the jade has is that its screen is a tiny bit brighter - but the zenfone’s screen is bright enough that this is a very minor con at best . when samsung released the gs6, it was a big departure from its predecessor . samsung ditched the removable storage and battery that they had become known for and went in a new direction with a sealed glass and metal body . now samsung has given the same treatment to the note 5 . it eschews the note 4’s microsd and removable battery for even more metal and glass . is this a worthy trade-off . vs note 4: . when i hold the note 4 and the 5 in my hands, i kind of like the exaggerated edges on the 4 . it feels sturdier than the smooth curved glass back of the 5 . then again, the 5’s all glass back feels classier than the 4’s plastic back cover . the 5 is has extremely narrow side bezels . this plus the curved back makes it feel much narrower than the 4 . then again, if you have fat baby hands like me then you have to hold the 5 very carefully because it's very easy to accidentally press the screen . to me, the 4 is a much easier phone to use simply because the sides are more forgiving to hold . while form over function sells phones, sometimes it isn’t a good thing if you’re actually going to use the phone . design-wise, the note 4 also feels just as slick as the 5 . this wasn’t the case with previous versions, where the newer version was usually more elegant than the previous . yeah the plastic back isn’t as nice as a glass one but the frame makes up for this . the 5’s soc is quite a bit more powerful . unlike the gs6, the 5’s power management seems quite reasonable so this is a big plus advantage over the note 4 . still, the 4’s soc, while slower on paper, doesn’t really feel much slower when you use it . when i open apps with them side-by-side the note 5 is always faster but only by a fraction of a second . the 5’s screen is a bit brighter, which is always a welcome upgrade with amoled displays, since they need the extra light outdoors . like the 4, the 5 has a noticeable colour shift when you view it off angle which is distracting . the camera is also a bit better - it’s more sensitive . i’m very unhappy that the 5 ditches the 4’s removable battery and microsd . while this does allow samsung to include the slick curved glass back, losing those 2 features is too steep a price to pay . there are actually 2 more features you lose with a 5 that no one’s going to notice . first off, the uv meter is gone - i actually use this feature so i’ll miss it but i’m probably the minority . the infrared blaster is also missing . i have mixed feelings about it - while an ir blaster can be useful, samsung never shipped their galaxies with useful infrared software so this feature was probably vastly underused . right now, the note 4 is running 5 . 0 . 1 while the 5 is running 5 . 1 . while i expect both phones to remain reasonably up-to-date, i think the 4 will stop receiving updates before the 5, simply because it’s older . to be honest, between the 2, i’d probably pocket the money, get a note 4 and pop a microsd in it . it’s easier to use and still a very competent phone . vs galaxy s6 edge +: . the edge + is basically a note 5 with a curved screen, a slightly narrower body sans the s-pen . what i find more interesting is that the note 5 will only be available in north america and asia (who knows if this will change) . what’s even more interesting is that the edge + costs more than the note 5 or to put it more simply; curved screen > s-pen . does this mean samsung is throwing in the towel with the note series? is marketing a stylus to customers too difficult? my guess is no . does this mean that samsung thinks customers value a curved screen more than a stylus? keep in mind my experience that a screen which curves away on the sides actually detracts from usage . then again, it enhances the ownership for some simply because it’s cool and different - possibly . do curved screens cost more than adding a digitizer and pen? maybe . that’s really the choice, do you want to pay extra for a curved screen and lose the s-pen or save a few bucks and get a s-pen and a flat screen . samsung toutes that the curved edge allows for a few more functions but as far as i’m concerned, most users aren’t going to bother using them . to make things more complicated, in canada, the plus is available in 32 and 64gb sizes while the 5 only comes with 32gb . neither has a microsd so pick wisely . vs lg g4: . speaking of not having microsd, if you don’t want something with expandable memory take a look at the lg g4 . the g4 is cheaper and has a microsd slot . it also has a removable battery and while the back isn’t quite as elegant as the 5’s glass, in canada lg tosses in a leather back with the g4 which is quite slick in its own right . on paper, the g4 isn’t as fast but when you use them side-by-side it’s hard to tell which is faster . while you “only” get 3gb of ram with the g4, there’s a case of serious diminishing returns when you go from 3 to the note 5’s 4gb of ram so again, it’s an advantage on paper only . both cameras take fantastic pictures but the note’s is a little more responsive . the multimedia capabilities on both are top notch . the g4 has a 5 . 5” 2560x1440 display while the note has a slightly larger 5 . 7” display with the same resolution . both are excellent . i do think that the g4 is an easier phone to use because the bezels are more reasonable . while i think that the note 5 should cost more than the g4, it’s tough to figure out why it costs so much more . really, unless you absolutely must have a samsung you’re probably better off with a lg g4 . body: . the note 5 has a very striking finish . it’s blue with a mirror finish . it kind of reminds me of the motorola krzr from a while back . samsung managed to make the note 5 very narrow for its size by shrinking the bezels . next they curved the the sides on the rear of the phone to make it fit more nicely in your hand . the effect is quite dramatic . however, i do find that it causes me some usability issues . first off, the bezel is so narrow it’s hard to not touch the screen accidentally . the bezel around the menu buttons is very small to so i accidentally pressed the back and task switcher a few times when i was playing games - it’s quite annoying . the galaxy s4 had a similar problem . holding it is like holding a pizza without a crust or a burger without the bun - things are going to get messy . if you’re going to get the note 5, you might want to pick up a case for it to give you a little more space between the screen and the sides . the buttons are really nice . they’re easy to find, have a nice click and give the right amount of feedback . like the gs6 pair, the note 5’s home button doubles as a fingerprint reader which you don’t have to swipe to use .  . it’s really convenient and works exceedingly well . other android phones need to get fingerprint readers asap . the nanosim slot is located at the top . overall, while undeniably sleek, the note 5’s body has some serious usability issues . if you plan on getting one, you either need to re-learn how to hold your phone or get a case . as the 5 is a note, it comes with samsung’s s-pen stylus . it has 3 improvements over previous ones . first off, it’s a bit more solid than the note 4’s .  . it’s also a tad longer but the biggest improvement is that the ended is now spring loaded . it clicks and pops out when you press it . so, when it’s in the phone, you press the tip to pop it out which makes it easier to pull out . the click is cool at first but gets annoying really quickly . i guess samsung figured people were starting to get used to their annoying “samsung whistle” message alert so they added the click . like the gs6, the note 5 doesn’t have a removable battery . instead, the whole device appears to be glued together with no exposed screws anywhere . all this means is that replacing the battery will probably be quite an ordeal . display: . you get a 5 . 7” 2560 x 1440 super amoled display which is a bit brighter than the note 4’s display . the off-angle colour shift that you got on the note 4 is also present on the note 5 . otherwise, it’s an excellent display . colours are natural looking, whites are very pure and blacks are extremely deep . it remains viewable even outdoors in direct sunlight . camera: . like the note 4 and gs6, the note 5 has a 16 megapixel camera . it doesn’t appear to be all that different from the gs6’s camera . this isn’t a bad thing as the gs6’s camera is one of the very best cameras on the market . samsung also has one of the better camera softwares available . it manages to balance lots of features without being too cluttered . one new feature is that you can record video and send it straight to youtube . you can send a link to up to 20 people . it actually works but there’s about a 20 second time delay . like the gs6, there’s a pro mode with features like: . exposure control . shutter speed . iso . white balance . manual focus . color mode . raw mode . note that you lose burst mode when you use raw mode - this is pretty typical . i love how you can double press the home button to launch the camera . when you do this, the note 5 is one of the fastest phones around at launching the camera app . the note 5 is also has one of the fastest and most responsive cameras . video quality is excellent . it can capture 4k video . software: . in the past, samsung has been criticized of putting too much software on their phones which chews up their available storage .  . samsung has tried to address this by making some of the extras optional . still, the note 5 is pretty feature packed . they’re re-emphasizing sidesync which mirrors the note 5 to your computer (pc or mac) or compatible samsung tablet . they’ve preloaded microsoft office with the note 5 . if you’re not a microsoft office user, you should know that you can remove the apps . all together, they eat up close to 900mb of space . if you do use them, you’ll get 100gb of onedrive space for free for 2 years . samsung has changed the s-pen software slightly . the functionality hasn’t changed much but there’s one new feature . you can use it to capture entire webpages or anything else that needs to be scrolled . it screen captures a page, scroll down, captures that for up to 20 times and then stitches it all together . apple needs to steal this feature so you can capture the eula whenever you update ios . performance: . you get the same processor as the gs6 . in the past, when samsung released new note versions, they'd usually contain hardware that’s half a gen or a full gen ahead of its contemporary galaxy s counterpart . this time around, samsung released the note 5 a little sooner so it shares the same soc as the gs6 . still, it’s one of the faster soc’s around . since the note 5 is larger it seems better at dissipating heat . while it can get quite warm, it’s doesn’t get really hot like the gs6 and gs6 edge do . as a phone: . the earpiece is extremely powerful, there’s a volume boost feature if you need even more . the speakerphone is also extremely powerful that also has a boost feature . rf performance is excellent . when i reviewed the gs6 and gs6 edge i was surprised at how awful the battery life was . given that the note 5’s larger battery probably only compensates for the increase in screen size i wasn’t expecting much from the 5’s battery . fortunately, it appears that the note 5 is able to keep battery consumption under control . i think it will last the day for most users . if you’re a power user though and need to top off half way through the day . you’ll be happy to hear the note 5 is capable of quick charging with a 15 watt charger . just for comparison, most ‘regular’ fast chargers support rates of up to 10 or 12 watts so the quick charger can be 50% faster . it also supports both wireless charging standards . samsung sells a wireless charger that can charge at around 10 watts which is faster than most other chargers . media capabilities: . like the note 4, the 5’s speaker is extremely powerful - one of the best around . it sounds decent too . samsung told me that the note 5 supports “ultra high definition audio” . they didn’t get more indepth than that but i figure it means that the note automatically resamples all audio to 192hz/24bit . if you store a lot of media on your phone, you should keep in mind that the note 5 does not have a microsd slot . while the included 32gb is probably enough for most, remember you won’t be able to expand it later if your needs change . if you’re used to the infrared blaster on previous samsung phones, you should know that this feature is now gone . conclusion: . like the gs6, the note 5 is so good it really moves the goal posts back for everyone . however, unlike previous generations, the improvements come with a cost, you to make some compromises over previous models . still, in the end i’m really not sure if i love the note 5 . as awesome as the screen, camera, speakers, are, the slim bezels just really gave me fits . when i game i frequently hit the back button by accident . when i hand the note 5 to someone they usually press the screen by accident - that sort of thing . it’s a case of form over function . i’m sure the slim bezels are going to help move a lot of note 5’s . however, it’s just not an easy phone to hold and use . do i just need to change how i hold a phone?  . the microsd and removable battery that had become a samsung signature feature are now gone . all that makes the 5 a lot less attractive . especially when the lg g4 brings a similar level of functionality for a lot less money . the zte grand x plus was and still is one of my favorite budget phones . when it came you out got a brand name phone and way more specs than the competition for only $200 . however the competition is starting to heat up so zte has a new salvo in the budget phone wars . the zte grand x 2 which gives you even more good stuff for even less money . vs motorola moto g 2015: . the 2015 moto g is $50 more and for the added money you get water resistance, a slightly more solid body, better camera, better sounding speakers and presumably, more android updates . both have the same snapdragon 410 soc but the g’s is clocked slightly higher (1 . 4 vs 1 . 2ghz) . while you save $50 with the zte, you actually gain a few features; first off you get double the ram . to me 2gb of ram is the sweet spot . if you switch between a lot of programs a you’ll notice a difference when you go from 1 to 2gb . at the same time, anything over 2gb results in diminishing returns . secondly and just as importantly, you get 16gb of storage vs 8gb on the g . consider this, when i connect the g to my computer it reports that there is 4 . 5gb of usable space, when i connect the zte it says there’s around 11gb . 8gb of storage is do-able but the extra gbs really makes the zte easier to live with because you’re less likely to run out of storage . between the 2 it’s a tough choice . the zte’s extra ram and storage are both good to have . but you can say the same about the g’s better speakers, camera, water resistance and frequent android updates . anyways, if the bottom line is important then the zte is a no-brainer . vs motorola moto e: . for about the same money you can also get the moto e second gen . i’ll keep it short and sweet; the grand x 2 has double the ram, double the storage, a much sharper screen . unless you really absolutely must have the e2’s exchangeable rear sides there’s no reason to get the e . body: . the 2’s body is a bit of a departure from the grand x and x plus whose bodies were more or less the same . zte has classied the 2 up a bit; the back cover has a pretty convincing look leather mould on it . heck, when you run your finger along the back it even kind of feels like leather but when you tap it, it’s obviously very hard plastic . considering the price though i’m pleased with the back . the back comes off but the cover no longer wraps around the sides . as a result the 2 feels a bit sturdier than its predecessors but it still has a way to go before i’d say it’s a really solid phone . under the cover is a removable battery which is starting to become increasingly rare on all phones . it’s funny but the sides/frame of the 2 kind of remind me of my old galaxy s (i think mine was the “vibrant” . the buttons feel similar and the metallic paint is similar . this isn’t a good or a bad thing, just a miscellaneous observation . the buttons themselves have a nice feel to them and are easy to find and press . there are dedicated menu buttons in front below the screen that light up blue . they’re handy and don’t get in the way when you use them . display: . you get a 5” 1280x720 lcd ips display . it’s not quite as nice as the g’s display which has the same specs . it doesn’t have very dark blacks and the colour is a little bit warmer . it also loses a bit more light off-angle . on the other hand, it doesn’t have a visible grid pattern on it like the g does when you look up close . you also don't’ have to deal with disappearing on-screen buttons like you do with the g . overall while i’m not blown away, the display is adequate . camera: . on the back is a 8 megapixel autofocus camera with a led flash . it’s focuses pretty quickly and is pretty easy to use . considering the price of the grand, you shouldn’t expect too much from the camera and indeed, while it’s not a bad sensor, it’s not capable of miracles either . indoors, pictures can get a bit rough and noisy looking but they’ll still be usable if you snap a couple of extras so you can choose . there’s no shutter speed control but the iso and level are pretty cool additions to a phone at this price point . you’ll have to manage your expectations with video too . indoors there’s a lot of noise reduction so video can get very soft looking . the microphone does a decent job but it picks up a bit of handling noise . software: . out of the box the grand x 2 comes with android 5 . 1 which is pretty good . right now, 5 . 1 is the newest non-beta version of android . that said, if history is an indicator, i wouldn’t expect the x to receive anything newer . zte has their own launcher . highlights include a slightly different pull down with more switches and a slightly different home screen . there’s an annoying press and hold to unlock gesture . it’s annoying because sometimes it’s hard to keep it perfectly still if you’re moving around quickly but this is really a minor quibble . there’s the requisite 3rd party gallery app, video player, file manager, text messaging app (because no one wants to use hangouts), task manager and music apps . zte also tossed in a diary app and sound recorder .  . overall, in terms of bloat the zte isn’t too bad . if you’re using pure android you probably have to download your own gallery, video player, file manager, text messaging app and task manager anyways . performance: . inside is a qualcomm snapdragon 410 - the same soc you’ll find in a motorola moto g 2015 . however, the g’s is clocked at 1 . 4ghz while the grand’s is 1 . 2ghz so you’ll notice that the g has a minor advantage in benchmarks . to be honest, while the extra speed is welcome, i doubt anyone is going to notice the difference . another thing to point out is that the included adreno 306 gpu included with both appears to be running at the same speed so both devices have identical graphics performance . really there are no surprises here with regards to performance . while the zte does have double the ram, the amount of ram rarely has an effect on benchmarks as long as there is enough of it . as a phone: . the earpiece maximum volume is average . the speakerphone max volume is below average . rf performance is quite good . the battery should last most people the day . unlike most competitors, the grand comes with a removable battery . media capabilities: . the speaker is loud enough but it doesn’t sound like it has been tuned at all . there’s no bass to speak of so it’s strictly utilitarian . when you lay the zte flat on its back i noticed that the speaker can get muffled . the problem is that the bumps next to the speaker don’t stick out enough . this doesn’t allow enough space for the sound waves to get out . i mentioned this a few times already but it’s worth bringing up again that the grand comes with 16gb of built-in storage . for $150 you usually only get 8gb of storage . 8gb isn’t too bad but 16gb should be enough to please a lot of people . anyways, if that’s not enough, there’s also a microsd card slot . conclusion: . for $150 can locked on prepaid the grand x 2 it’s a stonking good deal . the 2gb of ram will help it run large apps smoothly while the 16gb of ram make it much easier to live with than with other phones in its price range . the neat leather-ish back is a bonus as is the removable battery . still, it’s not the perfect phone . the screen has pretty lousy black levels, the speaker isn’t all that great and the camera takes rough looking pictures indoors . but hey, when you consider that it’s only $150 on prepaid, these problems aren’t really deal breakers . it’s really a motorola killer . among flagships, motorola’s x line has always been a bit hard to understand . the first one costs slightly less than competing flagships but it gave up some specs compared to them . ditto for the second gen x . now, we’re on the 3rd generation and motorola has mixed things up . the x lineup now bifurcates into the moto x pure and the moto x play . the pure is a true flagship with the request flagship specs and price tag . however, the play is the more interesting model . it trades some big specs for a more a palatable price tag . we’re now in the “good enough” era of smartphones where flagship ownership is no longer mandatory to have a good experience . it mixes some flagship-ish features which some midrange ones to bring the price tag down to $400 . throw a large 3630mah battery into the pot and we have something very unique . let’s check it out . vs 2014 motorola moto x: . i noticed last year’s unlocked motorola moto x in the staples flyer today for $400 can . that’s what a locked play goes for if you buy it from a carrier here in canada . but newer is better right? not always; in the case of the moto x play, motorola is attempting to bring the x franchise to a lower price point . to put it more bluntly, it’s cheaper than previous x’s . the 2014 x uses a qualcomm 800 series soc, the snapdragon 801 . the play on the other hand uses snapdragon 615 which is their upper midrange offering . even though the 615 is newer, in terms of performance, there’s quite a gap between it and the 801 . it’s big enough that you’ll notice that the 801 scrolls smoother in games and loads apps a bit faster . the 2014 also has an amoled screen while the play has an lcd . you can argue about which type of screen is better but i’m pretty sure that in general, amoled screens cost more than lcd’s which is another change moto made to bring the play’s price point down . both have 2gb of ram and 16gb of storage . on the play, this is fine because there’s a microsd slot built-into the nano sim card tray but on the 2014 the microsd is mia . 16gb is a decent starting point but if there’s no expandable memory, it’s not a good choice on a non-budget phone . right here is one of the biggest differentiators between the play and the 2014 . the camera is different too; the play’s sensor is noticeable more sensitive (better indoors) than the 2014’s and is much more usable . the flashes are also different, the 2014 comes with a ring flash with 2 led’s . when i tested it, i found that the ring flash is a gimmick and doesn’t add any additional value to a phone . maybe motorola realized this too and stuck a more useful dual-tone flash on the play . the other big differentiator is the battery, the 2014 comes with a tiny 2300mah battery while the play has a formidable 3630mah . to be honest, that plus the lack of a microsd and only 16gb of storage keeps me from recommending it . however, if you can live with these 2 compromises then the 2014 is a very sleek phone with an awesome metal body . otherwise, the play is a much more sensible choice . vs alcatel onetouch idol 3: . for around $100 less, you can pick up an alcatel onetouch idol 3 . the idol also has a 5 . 5” 1920x1080 display, 2gb of ram, 16gb of storage and a qualcomm snapdragon 615 soc . so what do you get for $100 more? first off, the play’s screen is nicer to look at . it’s more neutral looking and it’s noticeably brighter . i took some sample pictures indoors and the play’s camera blows the idol away . the idol comes with a more than adequate 2910mah battery while the play has an even beefier 3630mah along with support for quick charging (the quick charger is not included in the box) . 2910mah will get everyone through the day, 3630mah will get some users through 2 days - go out on saturday morning, come back on sunday night sort of thing . there’s also the software update issue, alcatel is a little better in this department but they have a ways to go before they can match motorola’s almost frantic pace of android updates . one area where the idol a clear winner are its speakers . while the play’s sound decent, the idol’s sound even better plus they’re much louder . did i mention i love the idol’s speakers? i put some tunes on the idol when i was writing this and am now a few songs into my play list - they’re that good . here, i think it’s a bit of a wash . $100 is a lot more to pay at this price point, plus the idol is a competent phone . still, if you can pony up the dough, the play is slightly better in areas but more importantly you gain its epic battery life . vs asus zenphone 2 2 . 3ghz: . the zenphone 2 is about $30 can less and it’s sold unlocked . it has a faster soc, double the ram, quadruple the storage (yes, 4x), dual sims (not that useful in north america) . if the play is an ala cart entree then the asus is an all you can eat buffet . both have cameras which are very good for a non-flagship device . so why wouldn’t you get the zenphone? first off, if i may be blunt, the speaker on the zenphone sucks . secondly, while i’d say it’s adequate, the asus’s screen is very dim compared to the plays . both have plastic bodies but the zen’s feels much cheaper . the lousy speaker and cheap-y plastic body are enough for me to recommend the play over the asus despite the smorgasbord of specs . however, moto better watch over their shoulder because the zen is dangerously close to really screwing things up for everyone else . body: . unlike last year’s moto x, the play has a plastic body . you can tell it’s plastic by looking carefully at the paint near the seams at the top . despite being made of plastic, the play is a very solid phone . it’s probably due to the large battery but there’s no flex at all when you twist it . i guess a phone doesn’t need to be metal unless it’s super thin . the battery cover is an interesting pattern on it . the buttons have an above average click to them though i was disappointed that the volume rocker has a bit of play to it . the back cover comes off so you can swap it . motorola has many different colours available for it along with ones with a built-in flap to cover the screen . like many other companies, the back cover is a tease - while you can kind of see the battery but you can’t really change it yourself . note how part of the piece that houses the camera goes over the battery . fortunately, unlike previous x’s, the play can take a microsd card which is located on the other side of the nanosim card tray . anyone else think this is a cool spot for a microsd . despite the large 3630mah battery, the play still has a curved back like other recent phones . you’d figure they’d go all flat and razrish on the play in order to fit such a large battery in . and even with the curve, the play doesn’t feel particularly thick thanks in part to the curve . despite the large battery, the play isn’t a heavy phone - it only weighs 15g more than it’s little brother the moto g 2015 and don’t forget that the g has a smaller screen . i do wish that the play was water resistant like it’s less expensive sibling the moto g 2015 . the play does have a water resistant coating inside, but it’s more to give it a fighting chance if you spill something on it . it’s not meant to let you use it in the shower . display: . the display is a 5 . 5” 1920 x 1080 lcd . at 400ppi, it’s extremely sharp . what you can’t tell is that it’s also extremely bright . it’s more or less as bright as the display on my iphone 6 plus (which is also 5 . 5”/1920x1080) . there are 2 color temperature settings, regular and saturated . both of them are pretty close to my 6 plus so they’ve clearly done a lot of tuning . black levels are good for a lcd as are viewing angles . it also works well outdoors . i have no complaints about the screen - it’s excellent and as good as a screen you’d find on a flagship . camera: . when i saw that the play comes with a 21 megapixel camera, i was a bit dismayed . to me megapixels might as well be called misleading pixels . too often it seems that more megapixels often means a worse camera . turns out i was wrong, the play actually takes really good pictures and is one of the best non-flagship cameras i’ve tried . the catch is that it sometimes misses focus so you have to be aware of that and sometimes snap a few extras . fortunately, it focuses quickly (like most phones these days) . shot to shot speeds aren’t slow but they’re slower than i’d like to see . ditto for the burst mode which should be a little faster . i’m not fond of the motorola camera software but it’s not so bad that you can’t get used to it . motorola seems to have something against shutter buttons . instead of tapping to focus and meter, you tap anywhere to capture . instead, you have to drag a circle around if you want to focus and meter . the fact that the play sometimes misses focus makes this problem more noticeable . anyways, motorola has been using this setup for 3 years now so if you’re coming from another motorola phone then you’ll feel right at home . video quality is usually good . however, when you’re filming, tapping the screen takes a picture so you can’t tap to refocus when you’re shooting . since the play sometimes misses focus, this can be very annoying . nothing is worse that taking a video and then realizing afterwards it’s too soft . software: . out of the box, you get android 5 . 1 . 1 . that’s the same version a nexus phone is running right now (unless you’re running a developer preview) so that’s as good as it gets . motorola is probably the best out of all android oem’s when it comes to updates so no surprises here . one reason why motorola is able to do this is because they try not to mess with android too much . that means they don’t try to duplicate all the default apps that android phones normally come with . their software consists of 4 apps . moto migrate which helps you move your data from your old phone to the play . they also include some software to extend google now so you can do more with it . there is also a different way to receive notifications . when the screen is off, it will display your notifications if you move it . it also seems to randomly turn on to display them and then turn off . the screen stays black with white text . previous moto x’s had amoled screens so doing this had very little penalty with the battery since amoled displays don’t consume power when they’re showing black . however, the play has a lcd display so i guess doing this uses more juice . still, the amount is very minor since it’s only on for a few seconds when this happens . anyways, the notifications are useful - my only complaint with it if you leave the screen brightness on max instead of auto, the screen can emit a bit too much light at night when it turns on to display notifications . this is a really minor problem though since you can tell the play to leave you alone at night . lastly, the camera and gallery app have received some updates . there is now a built-in qr code feature plus it can ocr a business card so it can automatically populate fields in your phonebook when you add a new entry . the gallery also has an offline slide-show function so it won’t consume any power like when you use google’s version of this feature . performance: . powering the show is a qualcomm snapdragon 615 soc . it consists of eight 64bit arm cortex a53 cores . four of them are running at 1 . 1ghz while the other four at 1 . 7ghz . the idea is that it uses the 4 slower, power sipping ones when solving simpler tasks while the faster power sucking ones only fire up when you need them . if you pay close attention, you’ll notice that qualcomm’s snapdragon 410 has the same cores but only 4 of them which usually run 1 . 2ghz or 1 . 4ghz . the big differentiator is that the 615 also pairs qualcomm’s adreno 405 gpu while the 410 has a more modest 306 graphics processor . compared to the idol 3, the play’s 615 cores run slightly faster, 1 . 7ghz vs 1 . 5g - that’s why the play is usually about 10% faster on non graphically intensive tasks . however, both their gpu’s run at the same speed which is why they have similar gaming scores . as for the 2014 moto x, while it’s snapdragon 805 soc is older and down 4 cores, it’s still a lot faster, especially on the graphics side where it’s substantially faster . ditto for the soc in the zenfone 2 which has performance roughly equal to a snapdragon 805 . as a phone: . maximum earpiece and speakerphone volume is average . rf performance is average . as you’d expect, a 5 . 5” phone with a 3630mah battery and cortex a53 cores is going to have good battery life and indeed it’s pretty epic . unless you game non-stop, it’s pretty much impossible to kill the battery in one day . even power users will make it through the day and part of the next . more typically, most users probably won’t have to reach for a charger on the weekend now . if you need to top off in a short amount of time, the play supports quick charge which can charge a battery at 15 watts instead of 10 - 12 watts like most faster, regular chargers which makes it up to 50% faster . media capabilities: . given that the play’s brothers, the nexus 6 and moto g 2014 and 2015 all have incredible stereo speakers i was really looking forward to the play’s . the single built-in speaker is louder and average and sounds like it’s been tuned . however, part of me was hoping for even more volume like you get with an idol 3 . i already mentioned this but unlike previous moto x’s, the play comes with a microsd card slot . if you need more space just pop card in and you’re good to go . conclusion: . motorola picked a good price point to launch the moto x play . there just isn’t a lot of competition at $400 can . gauging if it’s a good value is tricky . for $100 less, you can get an alcatel onetouch idol 3 . are the play’s better screen, better camera and epic battery worth $100? i’d say yes but you can’t go wrong either way . for $30 less, you can get an asus zenphone 2 which is fully spec’d out with 4gb of ram and 64gb of storage . indeed the specs are juicy but the play counters with better speakers, better screen, much better built quality . again, i’d say you can’t go wrong either way . so overall, i’d say the play is well priced and presents decent value . with school just around the corner, many of you are thinking of picking up a decent phone on a budget . no doubt the original moto g will probably come up quite frequently . the problem is that the original moto g came out 2 years ago and its successor, the 2014 didn’t get people quite as excited partly because it lacked lte, partly because it was priced too high and partly because it didn’t gain much traction with carriers (probably because of the lte issue) . anyways, they’re back with their newest g, the 2015 moto g . the addition of lte is a no brainer but now they’ve changed the game with the addition of water resistance for under $200 . hmmm… . vs asus zenfone 2 1 . 8ghz: . the asus zenfone is about $70 dearer and given their target markets, paying an extra 35% over a g for the asus may stretch some budgets . still, for the extra $70, you get a more compelling device . the asus has a larger, higher resolution display . more importantly, it's not like how 400 and 500 dpi look more or less the same to the naked eye; when you go from 290 to 400dpi the extra resolution is noticeable .  . it also comes with 2gb of ram and 16gb of storage which make the asus easier to live with . its soc is also faster though the advantage in processing power is less noticeable even if the benchmarks say otherwise . the advantage under the hood extends to the back too - its camera takes better looking pictures . there’s also the dual sim cards which may make the asus better for travelling - just remember that one sim is gsm only which really limits it to being used for voice only unless you can tolerate the slow speeds you get with edge . that said, the moto has some advantages too . the speakers are noticeable better sounding and louder . the body is more solid and it’s also water resistant . if you can make some room in your budget, you’re probably better off with a zenfone 2 . vs motorola moto g 2014: . the 2014 wasn't very popular with carriers and in canada ended up being sold unlocked at staples for $249 . 99 canadian . spec-wise it has an older 32bit snapdragon 400 soc which is slightly slower than the 2015's snapdragon 410 . the 2014 also lacks lte and an 8 megapixel camera with a regular led flash . the 2015 has lte, a 13 megapixel which takes slightly better pictures, lte plus it's water resistant . more importantly, the water resistance is pretty idiot-proof . as long as you're able to snap the cover on you're set; there's no cover over the microusb connector . it's widely available from carriers and while it's locked, it's also a more palatable $200 can . vs zte grand x plus 2: . the grand x plus 2 has very similar specs but there are 3 key differences; the zte has double the ram, double the storage and is priced $50 lower . the g has better sounding, stereo speakers, water resistance and a higher megapixel camera . the g’s speakers are pretty awesome and the water resistance is a nice thing to have but practically speaking, 2gb of ram and 16gb of storage are more useful to more people . the 16gb of storage gives you a lot of breathing space and 2gb of storage will result in less programs having to re-launch when you switch between them . i will say that based on recent history the moto’s software will stay fresh longer than the zte’s . last year’s 2014 moto g came with 4 . 4 and is currently running 5 . 0 while it’s contemporary model from zte; the grand x plus is still stuck on 4 . 4 . anyways, the $50 you save with the grand x plus 2 is the icing on the cake . body: . while the general shape of the body hasn’t changed, it’s now much more solid . i never thought that the 2014 felt like it was cheaply made but the 2015’s frame is on a different level . it’s also water resistant now and it doesn’t need a special cover over the microusb or headphone jack to achieve this which is very impressive . most water resistant phones i’ve encountered usually have a microusb port cover . you just need to be careful when you attach the back because it has a lot of snaps to . you need to press in around the sides and then around the camera module . if you don’t do this you’ll usually miss one snap . note the gaskets on the back cover that go over the slots . under the cover are the microsd and microsim slots . the back cover has a raised pattern on it which is more interesting than the 2014’s plain finish . to my eye it also makes it looks slightly less sleek but only just . as always, you can swap the back cover for other ones including this one with a built-in flap . display: . the screen is 5” with a resolution of 1280x720 which yields a pixel density of 290ppi . it falls just short of the 320ish ppi you need for a really sharp display . most of the time, the missing 30 ppi isn’t a big deal but you will notice if when you have very small text .  . it has very good whites . viewing angles are good and it works well outside in direct sunlight . i did notice that you can see a diagonal grid on the screen - it’s kind of distracting . overall, it’s an adequate display and more importantly, aside from the faint pattern, it’s an improvement over the 2014 moto g’s display . camera: . the resolution has been bumped to 13 megapixels plus you get a dual-tone led flash . i’m not a big fan of camera phone flashes in general but dual-tone flashes usually work well . they yield better colour but they still make your pictures look like you’re using a flash . pictures have more detail and are cleaner looking than the 2014 moto g’s camera . that said, pictures still look washed out . while they’re better, they’re still not quite good enough . still, i’m pretty happy with the shot-to-shot and focusing speeds . they make the 2015 more usable . given adequate light, video looks decent . the microphone isn’t too bad either . the front facing camera has a resolution of 5 megapixels . i was pretty happy with the pictures from it . it’s still using motorola’s camera software which i’m not a fan of, but given the extra speed i don’t mind it as much as i used to . overall, the camera is an enough of an improvement that some will find it good enough but overall still needs some work . software: . the 2015 g ships with android 5 . 1 . in the past 2 years, motorola has been really good about keeping their phones up-to-date . the original 2013 moto g came with 4 . 3 and since then it’s been update to 4 . 4, 5 . 0 and now for some users, 5 . 1 . so based on this, there’s a good chance the 2015 will get quite a few updates . it’s also worth pointing out that motorola is pretty pedantic when it comes with their updates so along with receiving updates, you usually get them more frequently than other manufacturers . the 2015 doesn’t deviate from motorola’s strategy with regards to software . that means they try to leave android alone as much as possible . the list of extras is very short; you get a custom help app and something to help you migrate from your old phone . you also get their “moto” app which flashes notifications on the screen when the phone is off . performance: . inside is a qualcomm snapdragon 410 . it has four 64bit arm cortex a53 cores clocked at 1 . 4ghz which is an upgrade from four 32bit arm cortex a7 cores clocked at 1 . 2ghz . the gpu model number gets bumped from an adreno 305 to a 306 . practically speaking, the processing side is an enough of an improvement that the 2015 is slightly faster when you have them side-by-side . identical webpages load a fraction of a second faster, the camera launches quicker . that sort of thing . however, the gpu is actually slightly weaker . in benchmarks i’ve found that the 306 is actually about 10% slower .  . of course, i have to bring up the zenfone again . for slightly more money, you get a faster phone with a lot more graphics power . note how the benchmark chart looks like the intel processor in the asus is giving a big middle finger to qualcomm . i assure you it was purely coincidental . as a phone: . rf performance is very good . maximum earpiece volume is excellent . sound quality is good . the speakerphone’s volume is average . behind is a 2470mah battery, given the size of the screen, resolution and soc it’s a decent size and should last most users the day . media capabilities: . i love the stereo speakers . while they haven’t changed much from the 2014, they’re still one of the best pair around . in absolute terms, they don’t quite have the oomph in the bass department as say a nexus 5 and while it’s not a quiet phone, a bit more volume would be nice too . as i already mentioned, the moto g only comes with 8gb of storage . note that this is only in canada, down south you can pick up a version with double the ram, 16gb of storage and a lot less complaints about those 2 bullet points . since i have the 1/8gb variant, i’m just talking about that one . 8gb of storage can be a bit of a pain if you store a lot of music or snap a lot of photos so if that’s you, you might want to pick up a microsd card . conclusion: . the addition of lte and water resistence help the 2015 moto g stand out in an increasingly crowded field . however, the competition is fierce - if you can swing it, an asus zenfone 2 is a few more dollars and has more ram, more storage, a bigger, sharper screen and a better camera, while you can get can the double ram and storage for $50 less with a zte grand x plus 2 . subjectively, the moto g has better sounding speakers plus the body is more solid than these 2 phones so you have to weigh whether those features plus the water resistance are worth it . i borrowed a samsung galaxy s6 edge from howard chui . i've been a longtime fan of samsung high-end smartphones, but of late i've become rather disappointed in the slow pace of real improvement in the subsequent models . this isn't strictly a samsung issue however, as this has been the case with every manufacturer out there . the smartphone, like the pc before it, has begun to reach maturity and the level of improvement from one generation to the next has slowed down considerably . the new models are indeed more powerful and have more features, but only incrementally so . it's becoming increasingly difficult to justify the purchase of a new device every year . as i am still the owner of a galaxy s4, i thought that i'd at least be impressed with 2 generations of incremental improvement . however, i was quite surprised at how little had apparently changed in the 2 years since the release of the s4 . don't get me wrong though, but the s6 is clearly faster, as the benchmarks attest, but overall the s6 doesn't feel as though it is as much of an improvement over the s4 as i'd expected . for example, when i tested the iphone 6, i was really impressed with the incredible smoothness when i played videos (from many different sources) with steady-rate full-screen panning . i assumed that the reason the iphone 6 was better at this than my s4 was simply because it had a more powerful gpu and a faster 64-bit cpu . i therefore expected to see the same smooth motion on videos played on the s6, but surprisingly, all that cpu and gpu power in the s6 doesn't seem to make much difference at all in this regard . perhaps it's an underlying issue with android, but certainly not one that has been addressed since 4 . 2 . 2 jellybean (which i still run in my s4) . comparing the performance of the web browser (specifically using chrome) was another odd case . most web pages i tried opened just as fast on my s4 as they did on the s6, despite doing exceptionally well on benchmarks associated with web page access . it didn't seem to matter how complex or large the pages were, the speed of opening them to their full glory was not something the s6 managed to do any better than the s4 . the speed of launching apps, and performing various operations inside of those apps, was a mixed bag . in some cases the s6 was faster (and sometimes by a wide margin), but in other cases, such as opening an email in gmail, the differences were often hard to tell . the s6 would usually be faster when the thing being loaded hadn't yet been cached, but after both phones had the material cached, they seemed to access it at around the same speed . samsung galaxy s6 edge, f/1 . 9 1/100 iso 50 (cropped) . that doesn't mean there aren't a few stand-out features on the s6, beginning with the camera . yes, it has a few more megapixels than the one in the s4, but the real change in the camera is the ease at which one can take an excellent photograph . the s4, like other smartphones from 2013, doesn't have optical image stabilization, and taking blur-free photographs in anything less than sunlit conditions is difficult . with the s6 on the other hand, i can take blur-free shots under almost any conditions without giving it much thought at all . when the shots are good however, the overall quality is hard to distinguish between the s4 and s6 . video, however, was a bit of a disappointment . i'd once again expected performance on par with the iphone 6, but even when recording at mere 30 fps in 1080p (which the s4 can do, and should be a walk in the park for the powerful gpu and cpu in the s6) the overall smoothness of the results is not that different . there are still tiny hiccups in the video during full-screen pans, and it is still evident that the video is made up of a series of short-exposure pictures strung together . the iphone 6 is still king when it comes to smartphone video performance . note this is howard's fat hand . another great (though not excellent) feature is the non-swipe fingerprint reader on the home button . last year i was very impressed with the overall ease-of-use of the fingerprint reader was on the iphone 6, and how much of a pain it was to use the reader found the s5 . samsung has addressed this problem by putting in a touch fingerprint reader than only requires the user to hold their finger on the button as they press it to wake the phone up . however, to apple's credit, their reader seems to be much faster than the one on the s6 . whenever i'd wanted to unlock the iphone 6, i'd just put my finger on the button, press it, and the phone unlocked . with the s6, i often find that it takes a noticeable amount of time between pressing the button, and when the fingerprint is approved and the phone is unlocked . the casing, which is made of metal and glass, does seem to exude quality (and indeed the fit and finish is excellent), but i could never seem to shake the feeling that i was holding a very fragile device . of course, i wasn't about to test the durability of the casing by dropping it (as i have accidentally done with my s4), but i'm not so sure that the s6 would hold up as well to drops as the plastic s4 or s5 would . i would have preferred to have tested a plain s6, rather than the s6 edge, because i found the curved screen on the edge model to be annoying at the best of times . while i'm sure that someone must have come up with a use-case for curved screen sides, i certainly can't imagine one . it seems more like a gimmick to me, but the sales figures seem to suggest that it's a real winner with buyers . the screen itself didn't exactly blow me away (curvature notwithstanding) . i put the s6 into manual brightness mode, i cranked it up to full, and then i turned up my s4 to full brightness as well . i took them out to look at them in direct sunlight to find out if either of them was easier to see . i'd expected the s6 to leave my s4 in the dust, especially since i'd been so impressed with the brightness of the s5's screen . surprisingly however, the s6 wasn't all that much brighter than the s4, which (without doing a side-by-side comparison with an s5) suggests that when it comes to screen brightness, the s6 has taken a slight step backward . i was hyped to see what sort of gps performance the s6 was capable of . samsung has a history of putting some really outstanding gps chips in their phones, which get better in each successive generation, but the one in the s6 was a huge disappointment . not only did it not seem to include support for chinese satellites (as does the s5 and many other current phones), but it couldn't produce locks as accurate as my s4 under any circumstances . even outdoors, with a commanding view of a cloudless sky, the gps rarely reported 3 meter accuracy (which my s4 can 80 to 90 percent of the time) . at first i thought this was the result of a different algorithm for generating the reported accuracy, and so i ran side-by-side tracks . much to my surprise, the s6 produced far less accurate tracks . perhaps the s6 i tested was just a lemon, and maybe most of them perform better than this, but as i've noted in other past reviews, i have only the device i tested to go on . when it comes to audio, the s6 hasn't evolved much . like the s5 before it, the s6 isn't much better than the s4 . they moved the speaker to the bottom of the phone, which is an improvement, but the overall volume and tonal quality of the speaker suggests that it is the same sounder they been using for years . i've heard markedly better speaker performance on other phones (in particular those built by htc) . when it comes to the earpiece however, the s6 is like most of the galaxy models before it, where quality and volume is among the best out there, so there really wasn't much room for improvement anyway . battery life seemed okay for a phone with a high-power chipset in it, but when i was actually using the phone, the battery discharge rate was a bit higher than my s4 . also, there was a bug in the s6 that sometimes forgot to turn off the gps after an app was finished with it . once this happened, only rebooting the phone would turn it off . if the gps was left on, the discharge rate (even with the screen off) was quite high, at around 5 to 10 percent per hour . the cpu and gpu are so powerful that they routinely generate a fair amount of heat, even when you aren't doing any heavy-duty work . the back of the phone gets uncomfortably warm under prolonged use, and if you play games, the heat can be quiet annoying . one of the things that helps keep me on samsung phones is the ability to force a particular lte band . i don't much like band 7 (2600 mhz), as it often has exceptionally poor uplink speeds unless the signal is strong . with rogers preferring 2600 mhz where available, my only hope is to force band 4 . what i really would have liked is a way to tell the phone to not use a specified band . lo-and-behold, the s6 has this very capability, meaning i can tell it to ignore band 7 and use any other bands that are available . this alone almost tempted me to run out and buy one, but once reality set in, i realized that it wasn't a good enough excuse . until the s6, many samsung fans used to tout the replaceable battery and microsd card as reasons why they stuck with the brand . it was a big shock to many fans when samsung decided to scrap both of these things . i used to believe that they were important to me, but when i look back over my years of smartphone use, i can't honestly say that i've relied on either . i use an external battery to keep up the charge on my phone when i really put a high demand on the battery (such as when i track long 4-hour-plus bike rides, while simultaneous broadcasting my location using glympse), and i never pull the 32 gb card out of my s4 . i backup my data to external usb flash drives using an otg cable, or directly connecting the device to a laptop . in summary therefore, the s6 is only a slight improvement over the s5 it replaces and not much of an improvement over the 2-year-old s4 . unless you're made of money, or have a burning desire to own the most recent technology, keep your high-end 1- or 2-year-old smartphones for another year and save the money . if you're in the market to replace a much older phone, or a lower-end model, the s6 a well-built phone that has few killer downsides, but at the same time, there are things about it that are outclassed by others (the iphone 6 for example) . as for the curved edges, unless you can image an actual use to put it to, do yourself a favor and opt for the less expenisve s6 instead of the s6 edge . if gps performance is really important to you, and the issue i saw on this s6 is typical, then this could be a deal-breaker . let’s play some word association: computers, motherboards, asus . about 5 to 10 years ago when i was a huge computer nerd i spent way too much money on asus parts . i even used to have a stack of asus motherboard boxes . after microsoft, intel and apple, asus is one of the brands that comes to mind when i think about computers . however, when i think about smartphones, asus don’t usually come up . still, when i think about computers and smartphones, the next word is tablet . when it comes to tablets, asus does come to mind - unfortunately, the tablets that i think of are usually the cheap 7 or 8” sub $150 black friday specials, you find at walmart/staples/tigerdirect . they typically come with a processor that’s a few generations behind, a dim screen and a version of android that will likely never be updated . yes, asus makes more fancier models but then they get lost in the discussion with the likes of samsung and apple . so when it comes to smartphones, asus as a brand has a bit of an uphill battle . until now, the north american market for phones was pretty much controlled by the carriers . you signed a contract and then got a subsidized phone through them . still, lately phones have gotten very capable to the point that you don’t have to spend top dollar to get a decent phone . since you don't have to spend as much as you used to, the need for a subsidy isn’t as important as it used to be . this opens the door to unsubsidized, unlocked phones which loosen carrier’s grip which in turn allows manufacturers to sell phones via other channels . some interesting phone include google’s nexus line, the oneplus one and now asus’ zenfone 2 . note that in north america, the zenfone is available in 2 different trims each with many colours . you can pick up the base model which has a 1 . 8ghz processor, 2gb of ram, 16gb of storage and a regular 10 watt charger or the step up with a 2 . 3ghz processor, 4gb of ram, 64gb of storage and an 18 watt fast charger . to me, at $250 the base model is the more interesting model . you do get more with the step-up model and at around $379, it’s still reasonably priced but the thing is, if you’re price sensitive, than $250 is already stretching it . i’d also contend that from a future proofing perspective, 2gb of ram will be sufficient for quite a while . you’re better off banking the price difference and upgrading a little sooner . what about the alcatel onetouch idol 3 . when i look at the zen phone, the first competitor that comes to mind is the alcatel onetouch idol 3 . it costs about the same money, and has very similar specs . both are rocking 13 megapixels cameras, 5 . 5” 1920x1080 displays, 2gb of ram and 16gb of storage . the zen pulls ahead with a processor that’s about 30% faster, dual sims and a slightly better camera . the idol counters with it’s powerful stereo speakers which just happen to be the zen’s weakness and more durable finishes . one question mark is how diligent asus and alcatel will be when it comes to android updates . i don’t have any experience with asus, but according to wikipedia they’ve updated many of their recent phones from kitkat to lollipop so i give them the advantage here . still, while the zen will attract a lot of notice because of its powerful processor and to a lesser extent, its dual sims, i think the idol is a more balance package . while it lacks the zen’s raw processing power, it still possesses enough for most people . i guess it’s more that the zen has a significant weakness (its speaker) while the idol doesn’t . anyways, it’s hard to go wrong with either phone . what about the motorola moto g 2014 . it’s funny how fast the market has moved . when the original g came out, we were all awestruck by how much you got for your money . fast forward 2 years and its successor, the 2014 moto g is now looking a little over-priced . the 2014 moto g is around $249 unlocked from staples up here in canada . while it does have stereo speakers which are more powerful, that’s the only thing it has going for it . the zen has a higher resolution screen, a much more powerful processor, lte, a noticeably better camera, more storage, more ram and just way more bang for your buck . body: . the design reminds me of my lg g3 . from the faux metal back to the rear mounted volume buttons it’s not a terribly original looking design . the speaker grill looks like it was lifted from an htc one . the back is plastic with brushed metal finish . while it's an interesting finish because you can actually feel the grooves left behind by the brushing process . unfortunately, it also feels cheap because it reminds me of a 3d picture where you can feel the ridges . annoyingly, the entire back comes off to reveal a non-removable battery - oh you tease! note the dual sim cards and microsd slot . while it has a nice finish, the back itself is pretty cheap . first off, the center of the back can be pressed - this doesn’t exactly instill confidence . next i noticed the plastic actually dented when i used my fingernail to pry it off . the worst however was when i attached the cover on in the wrong order . i actually managed to break one of the plastic latches on the cover off . i’m not joking! i hope asus saved a lot of money using such thin plastic because i’m not impressed . i’m not crazy about the back but most of this problem can be solved by buying a case for the zen . if you’re going to do that then this really isn't a big deal . while a lot of phones have curved backs, something about the zen’s is different - when i put it on my table and try to use it, rocks around like crazy . i’ve used other phones like the htc one m7, m8, m9, lg g2, g3, g4, motorola moto x, x2, g, g2 etc and haven’t really noticed this problem, so i’m not sure why it’s so pronounced on the zen . to my eye, the curve isn’t that extreme . maybe the zen has more heavy components located near the sides . anyways, i spend a lot of my time in front of a desk and find the fact that it rocks around quite irritating . i did notice that the finish on the sides (that aren’t part of the back cover) are quite soft and scratch quite easily, i tried to plug it in in the middle of the night and noticed the area around the microusb port is all scratched up now . at this point, i've only been using the zen for about a week and i haven't done anything to abuse it so this is pretty shocking . the bottom part of the front has an interesting grooved finish . unfortunately, it also attracts a lot of dust . while i’ve made the zen out to be a really cheaply built phone, it’s really just the back cover and sides . the rest of it is reasonably solid - when you squeeze it, it doesn’t really shift anymore than other phones and it resists twisting well . for some reason, the power button is located at the top and in the middle, away from the volume buttons which are located on the back . given the large screen, it’s not the greatest spot for a power button . still, you can double tap the screen to turn it on which makes it less of an issue . after i got used to the top-mounted power button i thought the zen handled quite well . the lack of buttons on the sides really let you focus on using the phone . the front is large enough that there’s plenty of room for the physical menu buttons so i never once pressed them by accident . the thickest part of the phone is 10 . 3mm which is a little thicker than i’m used to . if you’re going to toss it in a case, it’s going to feel a little chunky . microusb connector . nothing to see on the sides: . display: . i have no major complaints about the display . with 401ppi, it’s way past the point where you’ll see individual pixels; practically speaking, you won’t see a much difference if any between it and something with higher ppi . colour seems fine - by default, it’s just a tiny bit washed out . you can fine tune it in the settings if you want . off-angle, it loses a bit of light but not enough to complain about . outdoors, the display is excellent . there are 2 minor problems; first off blacks aren’t very deep . still, they’re darker than rachel dolezal so i guess as far as i’m concerned, that’s black enough .  . secondly, it's not the brightest screen on the market . that said, i didn't really notice this until i had it next to competitors like the moto g 2014 and the idol 3 so i guess it's not a big deal . more importantly, the screen works well outdoors so this problem isn't too major . camera: . you get a 13 megapixel sensor from toshiba on the back with a f/2 lens and a dual-tone flash . i recently reviewed the htc one m9,which had a higher-spec toshiba sensor so to be honest, i wasn’t expecting much from the zen’s camera . i mostly compared it to the idol 3 which costs similar money and also has a 13 megapixel sensor (an imx314 from sony which can also be found in the oneplus one and the pricey google nexus 6) . as it turns out, i was relatively happy with the zen’s camera . while i did find it rather noisy - i’ve never been too bothered by some grain so long as the picture itself looks fine . in that sense, i prefer the zen’s camera to the idol . while the idol pictures were cleaning looking with noticeably less grain, there was usually less detail . i don’t think it’s due to excessive sharpening because some of the tell tales of over-sharpening like sharpened-looking noise aren’t present  . colour is hit and miss . while it never really completely missed white balance, i generally though the idol did a better job in the colour department . the zen usually requires some some adjustment after the fact . here the idol’s colours are much closer, the can on the right is too purple in the zen’s picture, while the bin on the left is too blue . i also found that i preferred how the idol exposed scenes . the zen had a tendency to underexpose slightly which results in slightly darker pictures . the bottom line though is that i was generally happier with the zen and found i got more keepers from it . remember, how i said the zen tends to be more noisy? it actually because it does less noise reduction . here’s the proof . these are hand-held shots of my family room built-in . there’s still daylight but it’s not shining directly into the room . the moto g does really poorly here and is obviously the worst of the 3 . if you look carefully, the zen bests the idol here . there’s more detail in the picture frame and the flower . interestingly, both use the same shutter speed but the idol has to use a much higher iso . part of this is due to the slower f/2 . 6 lens which requires it to use a much higher iso value . the software itself has a lot of options - too many in my opinion but they don’t really intrude on the user experience so i won’t hold it against the zen . my only gripe with the software is the burst mode is horrible . it’s not very fast and afterwards, you have to choose which pictures you want to keep before it will let you shoot again . someone needs to tell asus that the point of a burst mode is for spontaneity . forcing you to choose which ones you want to keep completely kills that . video mode is quite noisy and colours can get compressed plus there’s no optical image stabilization so you need to be very careful when you hold it . otherwise i thought it was quite serviceable .  . software: . the zen is currently running android 5 . 0 with asus’ interface on top . while current trend is for oem’s to slim down their included software, asus bucks the trend with a ui that’s pretty heavy . it creates an interesting dilemma; on one hand, if an oem doesn’t use one at all then, all they’re competing on is hardware . while this is a good thing for customers, it makes it much harder for them to differentiate since they’re all drawing from the same pool of parts as everyone else . all they have to do to compete is release a device with higher specs than the competitor at a competitive price and suddenly the competitor is obsolete . i guess in a cynical way, the idea of an overlay is to stop this from happening because it creates just enough confusion that customers are tricked into choosing a phone with lesser hardware because they think the overlay is more useful . still, some times overlays are genuinely useful but there’s a balance between making something useful and just making a device that’s incredibly cluttered, out of the box . worse yet, since i started using the zen a week ago 3, new apps mysteriously appeared . i’m sure there’s a setting somewhere that keeps this from happening but the fact that it does this by default is worrisome . perhaps asus is trying to emulate the experience you got from a pc 5 years ago which typically came loaded with bloatware . the only thing that’s missing is a trial for aol and bing bar . some of these programs are useful but not all of them and that’s the problem . some extra programs are okay but no one needs this many . i’ll pick on a couple, why is there a need to a dedicated update program? all android phones automatically alert users as to when there’s a new update . the dedicated flashlight app is another example; when you use the flashlight shortcut from the pull down it doesn’t turn it on . instead it launches an app with useless settings like a flashing setting, multiple flashes, etc . who’s going to use those options . i did like the asus link app, once you’ve installed the companion app on your computer you can use the zen on your computer . i think it uses miracast to project it onto your computer . it works quite well and while there is a slight lag, i was still able to play a few games like plants vs zombies 2 on my desktop using my mouse . anyways, i can handle extras so long as you can uninstall them and reclaim the space they take up but most of these apps can’t be removed . performance: . under the hood is an intel atom z3560 1 . 8 ghz, 64bit, quad-core soc . my inner-computer nerd just loves the idea of an intel powered phone - my last 3 desktop computers all had extreme edition cpu's . graphics are handled by a powervr 6430 gpu @ 533mhz .  . computing power excellent while graphics performance is pretty good . the peacekeeper browser benchmark scores are right up there with qualcomm’s 805 soc which can be found on the google nexus 6 and 30% higher than the snapdragon 615 in the idol . it also does very well in pc mark: . gaming scores are also excellent outscoring the idol by over 100% and just slightly lower than note 4 and nexus 6 . yes, the later phones have much higher resolution displays but that’s their disadvantage . here’s the antutu score: . please note that i wasn't able to run 64bit antutu on the zen . this likely would have yielded a higher score . all in all, the intel processor turns in an excellent performance . considering the zen’s price point, its soc offers way more value similarly priced, qualcomm powered offerings . given intel’s absence from other flagship phones, i suspect intel maybe subsidizing the zen’s cost which makes it an even better value . as a phone: . the earpiece is slightly louder than normal . speakerphone volume is average . since the built-in speaker has no bass at all, it actually works well here since it’s only suitable for people’s voices . i tested the rf performance on the telus hspa network (which is shared with bell) . rf performance is very strong, it was able to keep a call with very few drop outs in a spot in my basement where the nexus 6 was struggling . i don’t normally talk about phone dialers much but the asus one has a really strange behaviour . like many phones, the zen will automatically search through your phone book as you dial a phone number and display matches at the top . if you see a match, you can tap it and the zen will dial in . so far so good . however, after you hang up, it reverts back to the dialer page with the partial phone number on it . what this means is if you press the dial button again, it will dial the partial phone number instead of redialing the last number you called . it doesn’t sound like much but for me, a lot of the time i’ll dial the same number back so it’s really irritating . while there are dual sim card slots, one of them is 2g (gsm/edge) . another way to put it is that one is strictly for voice or super slow gsm/edge data . in canada, this means that one sim card will only work on rogers and you won’t be able to get speeds above 236kb/s (lte goes up to 150,000kb/s) . just to clarify, the other sim card will work just on rogers, bell, telus, etc's lte network . in the states, the 2g sim card slot is only for at&t or t-mobile and any mvno’s operating on their networks . the intel processor can get quite warm when you use it but it’s not as bad as phones with cortex a57 cores . battery life really depends on how much you use it . when you’re gaming, battery life can drop really quickly . i thought the large 3000mah provides enough juice to last most users the entire day . power users will probably need to top-off towards the end of the day . media capabilities: . despite the impressive looking speaker grill on the back, the built-in speaker is one of the worst things about the zen . it’s tinny-sounding so there’s no bass at all plus it’s not very loud . the built-in music player has a pretty strong bass boost by default . it strong enough that that the boominess can sometimes take away from music at times but i have to admit that i thought it was pretty fun . if you have a pair of headphones that can keep up it’s punchier than chris brown . if you’re old enough to remember, it kind of reminds of sony’s mega bass switch which used to be on their old walkmans, discmans and minidisc players . if you don’t want heavy, under-water sounding music, you can disable the bass boost using the audiowizard function which has its own app, separate from the music player . you get 16gb of built-in store of which around 11gb is available . if that’s not enough you can get a higher-spec’d zen with 64gb and or you can toss a microsd into the mix . conclusion: . all in all, asus has really shaken things up with the zenfone 2 . if it had a fancier badge on it, they could have charged double for it - it’s a phenomenal value and is really going to make things tough for other companies . the zenfone 2 effectively puts a limit on how much lesser competitors can charge for their phones now . if you’re not samsung/htc/sony/lg and are going to ask for more than $250 for a phone with lesser specs - game over - you should just quit now . conversely, it also highlights just how hot the market for non-flagship devices is getting . phones are only going to get better and cheaper . you get computing power that rivals a flagship and blows away most of qualcomm’s offerings save for their latest 800 series processors . it’s not just a powerful processor attached to a mediocre phone either . the display is also quite good . it’s not quite flagship material but it’s easily good enough for most users . it’s as sharp as a flagship (to my eyes anyways) and colour is reasonable . the rest of the zen however is a bit of a compromise . the plastic on the back cover is cheap and very easy to damage . still, this is pretty minor, after all, how often do we take our sim and microsd cards? plus you can put the zenfone 2 in a case and suddenly the cheap plastic isn’t a big deal . as for the camera, it’s not bad but it’s not that great either, i’d say it’s a good for the price point but not a great deal like the processor is . there’s no nice way to put it but the rear facing speaker sucks - speakers don’t get a lot of notice but when it’s this bad it’s going to cause problems when you’re sharing videos or you just can’t hear the phone ring . so you have to decide if the savings are worth a phone that should be seen but can’t be heard . either way, the zenfone really punishes the moto g 2014 as far as value for your money goes and is a clear leader when it comes to bang for your buck . 2015’s batch of android flagship includes formidable competitors like the samsung galaxy s6 and the lg g4 . so, it should be interesting to see how well htc’s latest flagship the one m9, measures up . the m9 i'm testing is running on telus' lte network . vs htc one m8: . the specs indicate that the m9 is a substantial step up from the m8 . you get a 64 bit processor with more ram . the camera resolution and sensor size have been given a big bump so its numbers are all now class leading . battery capacity has also increased . however, while the individual parts are good, the execution leaves something to be desired . there’s a saying that something is “more than the sum of its parts”, unfortunately the opposite is true of the m9; it’s less than the sum of its parts . i get the feeling that the m9 would have been better if they had put a slower processor in with a smaller camera sensor with less megapixels . htc stuffed a snapdragon 810 soc into the m9 and as it turns out, this really affects everything . battery life, performance and even the camera all suffer because of the 810 . if you already have a m8 you’re not really missing out on anything with the m9 . vs samsung galaxy s6/s6 edge: . aside from price, the only advantage the m9 has over the s6 is that it comes with a microsd card slot and to a much lesser extent, the battery life is better . or to put it more accurately; the battery life sucks less . the s6 pair is faster, it’s louder, it’s better as a phone, the camera blows the m9’s out of the water, you get the idea . there’s no reason to pick the m9 over the s6 . vs lg g4: . i like the g4 even more than the gs6 so it’s no surprise; unless you must have a metal body that’s been glue together or you absolutely positively must have htc zoe and blinkfeed, stick with the g4 . body: . at a glance, the m9’s body is identical to the m8’s but there are 2 big changes . first off, the back feels different . the m8 had a very thick clear coat which, if i’m honest, made it feel cheap and slippery . the m9’s is much more matte and feels a bit more expensive . the other is that the power button has migrated to the right side of the phone . the m7, m8 (and their predecessors) all had their power buttons located on the top . when phones weren’t that large, a top-mounted power button was perfectly fine but as the screen size grew the having it on top started to become a nuisance since many people tend to grip their phone on the lower half which made reaching for the top inconvenient . so kudos to htc for finally getting with the times . while the button is conveniently placed, i wished it was just a tad stiffer . i found i hit it by accident a few times since it doesn’t require much pressure to press . i also noticed that the m9 is a bit shorter and narrower than the m8 which makes it fairly compact among its flagship competitors . like previous htc’s, the m9 has an off-center microusb port . i get that too much symmetry is boring but having an off-center charging connector just isn’t intuitive . htc is still using glue to stick the front and rear of the phone together . this time around, the front half is noticeable smaller than the back half . this makes assembling the m9 more forgiving since this makes small variances in alignment less noticeable . it’s worth pointing out that since the m9 is glued together, replacing its battery is going to be quite an ordeal . this is something to think about if you plan on keeping the m9 past 2 years when the warranty expires since that's usually when people begin to notice that the battery is deteriorating . the not-that-large 5” screen and curved back make the m9 a nice phone to hold . however, the curved back also means the htc doesn’t sit still on a table unless you put it face down . i mention this because mine fell off a table and sustained some minor damage . ir blaster . headphone jack, microusb port . microsd, volume, power buttons . nano sim slot . display: . the display also doesn’t look all the different from the m8 . it’s a 5”, 1920 x 1080 lcd . it looks plenty sharp to me and it doesn’t bother me at all that it’s not a qhd 2560x1440 display like the competition . unless you’re going to use them as a vr headset, there’s no practical difference in sharpness between the m9’s 450ish ppi display and the 550+ ppi’s on the competition . color is pleasant . black levels aren’t quite as deep as the lg g4 but they’re similar to the iphone 6 plus . i don’t have an m8 around to compare with directly but the m9 loses a lot of brightness off-angle . it’s similar to the g4 in this regard and really annoys the hell out of me when i’m trying to take pictures of my kids since it makes it difficult to frame shots outdoors . camera: . htc shook things up a little with the m8 . they kept the same 4 megapixel sensor as the m7 but they added a second camera which was used to record depth . one reason why people carry around large cameras is because their large imaging sensors all their photos to have shallow depth of field . that way only your subject is in focus while the background is blurry and not distracting . photographers call the shallow depth of field "bokeh" . the problem with camera phones is that they have very small imaging sensors which have a very depth of field - let's just call it "nokeh" . since the second camera recorded depth, the information could be used to with post processing to simulate a bokeh . it was an interesting idea but there were 2 problems; first off when i had the m8, i found that the bokeh effect was hit and miss . secondly, shallow depth of field wasn’t a feature only reserved for a m8, you could add bokeh to pretty much any picture from any camera phone after the fact . the second camera was really just a gimmick that had questionable utility . while the second camera was an interesting feature, it helped to hide the fact that htc removed one of the m7’s best features; optical image stabilization . as it turned out, the ois was one of the reasons why the m7 had better than average low-light performance . htc would have been better off trading the ois for some magic beans instead of the second camera . personally, i was never a fan of the ultrapixel camera . while it’s true that megapixels aren’t a good measurement of image quality, a lot of the time i wish my m7 had a little bit more . further, while the m7’s decent low-light performance allowed it to take many shots you simply couldn’t with other phones, i was never satisfied with the image quality . pictures were always kind of gritty looking and the m7 tended to overexpose shots . that said, to me, the best thing about the ultrapixel camera was how fast it was . it was able to fire off a burst faster than any other phone . now we arrive at the m9 and htc has switched gears . first off, they’ve moved the ultrapixel camera from the rear to the front which if i’m honest, sounds like an excellent idea . while i thought that the ultrapixel camera made a lousy rear-facing camera, its low light capabilities make it an excellent choice for a front-facing one . secondly - the rear camera now has a 20 megapixel, 1/2 . 4” sensor which is one of the larger sensors you’ll find on a ‘regular’ smartphone . unfortunately, the ois which i loved on the m7 is still missing on the m9 . so how well does all this work? unfortunately, not well . if you’re an m7/m8 user, you’ll find the m9’s camera experience is completely different . first off, the m9 camera is slow . i’m talking shot-to-shot speeds and start up times . unfortunately for the m9, the last 2 android phones i reviewed were the gs6 and lg g4, which completely wipe the floor with the m9 in this regard . there’s nothing flagship about the m9’s speed . the lack of ois really hurts the m9 . the gs6 and g4 produce much cleaner pictures and more importantly, their pictures are usually free of any shaking from my hands . outdoors, when there is plenty of light, the m9 camera works fine . color is nice and there’s plenty of detail . indoors, color looks fine but the m9’s pictures are very grittier looking . if you look closely, you’ll notice how noisy (grainy) and splotchy they are, plus there’s almost no fine detail . it's just a hot mess . here's a close-up of 2 pictures from my lg g4 review . it's a crop of a shot of my family room built-in . it was taken at night time with the room lighting (a chandelier with six 25 watt equivalent led bulbs): . make sure you right click each image to view it at full resolution . the difference is dramatic . while the gs6 missed the proper white balance (this doesn't usually happen), the rest of the picture is much cleaner than the one m9 . the noise is probably a result of 2 factors; first off, i suspect that the m9 is not able to keep up with the heat from the large-ish 1/2 . 4” sensor and thus can’t cool it efficiently . this segues into my next point . the m9 itself puts out too much heat . a hotter sensor will have more noise . that’s why generally speaking, longer exposures usually result in more artifacts in the picture . i also found that i often had to take multiple shots because most of them are blurry because i couldn’t hold the camera still enough . in case you’re wondering, yes, i do know how to hold a camera steady . to make matters worse, the autofocus isn’t all that great . it tends to miss completely which requires you to tap to tell it where you want it to focus . one interesting feature is the ability to shoot in raw mode but to be honest, it doesn’t fix any of the problems i just mentioned and is more of an attempt at distraction from how awful the camera is . video quality isn’t much better . indoors video is really noisy and messy looking plus the lack of ois is really noticeable . the htc heats up really quickly . heat is the enemy if you want clean images . if you’re able to keep the sensor cool chances are you’ll get less noise . so if you’re taking a long video, you’ll notice that it actually gets noisier after a minute or 2 . it’s too bad, one by one htc has gotten rid of what made their cameras special . first off, they got rid of ois, then they traded the ultrapixel’s low-light performance for a messy looking sensor . finally, they ditched all the speed of the m7 and m8’s camera for the m9’s slow camera . don’t forget that speed makes anything more intuitive so the m9’s camera isn’t as easy to use . it’s quite a stunning reversal, while i never thought the ultrapixels were class leading, they were at least an interesting alternative . now htc’s competitive advantage is completely gone and we just have a phone with a very unremarkable and mediocre camera . did htc completely give up on the camera . software: . the m9 ships with android 5 . 0 . it comes with htc advantage which, in canada, means you get: “get the latest software updates for up to 2 years automatically” . the fact that they say “up to” means that there’s the possibility you won’t get any updates at all . that's like me offering to give you up to a million dollars . still, if i may be less cynical, my m7 which came out 2 years ago is currently running on android 5 . 0 so there’s a good chance the m9 will still be getting updates in 2017 - assuming htc is still around of course . also included with htc advantage is 100gb of google drive space for 2 years (anyone think google will give this away for free in 2 years?), htc backup along with phone and live chat support . inside you get htc sense - it’s not all that different from sense on the m7 and m8 - just a few tweaks here and there . since the camera is so much slower than the its predecessors htc has de-emphasized their zoe software and blinkfeed - a feature which i never used can be disabled (actually i think the m8 had this too) . here’s something interesting; htc, which i’ve never thought of as shipping excessive amounts of bloatware, actually doesn’t have a lot of free storage space out of the box compared to the competition . it ships with 32gb of storage but when you start using it only around 22gb is available . where did all the extra space go . there’s still an infrared blaster at the top of the phone but unfortunately, htc is still using peel’s completely useless infrared software . if you’ve cut the cable like me, it’s can’t really do anything unless you subscribe to cable or something similar . performance: . inside is an 8 core, 64-bit qualcomm snapdragon 810 . you get four high performance, cortex a57 cores clocked at 2ghz and four energy sipping a53 cores . one problem i’ve noticed with a57 cores is that they run incredibly hot . when you’re forced to use them, they are absolutely devastating to battery life . be it the gs6, g4 or the m9, i get the feeling that they’re completely unready and only got pushed out the door due to competitive pressures . anyways, the m9 runs very hot . one time, when i was shooting some 4k video it stopped shooting and complained that it was overheating . according to my infrared thermometer the back was a toasty 115f . yikes . fortunately, once it hits 115f, the m9 will throttle the speed of speed and slow down so it never gets warmer than this . too much heat is not good for a phone because it’s not good for the components and can reduce their life . as it turns out, the m9 can’t handle the heat the 810 turns out . while it’s theoretically able to run at 2ghz, it rarely goes past 1 . 5ghz due to the heat . that’s why the m9 and its supposedly faster processor is sometimes outperformed by the lg g4 and it’s more pedestrian snapdragon 808 which only has half the number of a57 cores which have a slower maximum speed . i guess sometimes less is more . i mean the g4 has 2 cores than run at up to 1 . 8ghz while the m9 has 4 cores that can hit 2ghz . then again, it’s harder to market a device with fewer cores so i understand why htc decided to stuff a 810 in the m9 . perhaps m9’s relatively compact dimensions make it a poor choice for a fiery chip like the 810 . it's better suited for a larger phablet device . if it’s “warmed up”, it will sometimes stutter . you’ll really notice this when surfing the web . sometimes the m9 appears to pause and become unresponsive . in that sense, while the m9 should be faster than its predecessor the m8, sometimes it’s not . with all this in mind, i benchmarked the m9 like i do all my phones; on my desk is my basement office . i included its main competitors; the lg g4 and samsung gs6 along with the google nexus 6 - still current but with a more modest qualcomm snapdragon 805 and a samsung gs5 (snapdragon 801 - same as the m8) . for gfx bench gaming benchmark, i ran the manhattan test (opengl 3 . 0) . since i ran the on-screen test, the m9 and its lower resolution 1920x1080 display are at a tremendous advantage over the gs6, nexus 6 and g4 and their quad-hd displays . peacekeeper is a browsing benchmark which runs in any browser . i ran it in chrome which is available for pretty much any android phone . here the m9 does well with a score that's in the same ballpark as the g4 and gs6 . here are the antutu scores: . i figure these scores are affected by the heat . to test this i recorded 3 more antutu scores, one where i ran antutu immediately after gaming for 10 minutes so that it was even hotter and the other after sitting in my freezer for 30 minutes - yes, my freezer where i store my frozen peas along with countless other forgotten foods . when the m9 is warmed up scores actually drop around 10% . the really interesting part is that when the m9 is frozen it actually scores approx 15% higher . so i guess all you have to do to unleash the snapdragon 810’s full potential is some arctic silver and a giant heatsink . one thing’s for certain, if you shake someone’s hand and find that it’s all clammy, chances are they own a m9 . conversely, if you live in the arctic and don’t like to wear gloves than the m9 may be the phone to get . benchmarks are great but you're probably wondering how fast the m9 is in real life . as it turns out, when it comes to tasks like launching the camera app and chrome it's a step behind the g4 and gs6 . the difference is exasperated if you've been using it and it's warmed up . as a phone: . earpiece volume is above average - it’s louder than my iphone 6 plus . incoming sound quality is clean . the speakerphone volume is also above average . rf performance is average . battery life varies a lot depending on how much you use the phone . the snapdragon 810/cortex a57 are just a death sentence to battery life . still, the 2840mah battery is well sized for the class - the gs6 has a puny 2550mah while the g4 has a meaty 3000mah . i think average users can make it through a regularly day without having to charge while power users will have to top off . media capabilities: . like the m7 and m8, the m9 has stereo speakers which have very good sound quality . still, while i didn’t compare them side-by-side, i don’t think there has been an improvement in terms of volume which is kind of disappointing since many of the competition have caught up in terms of sound quality and volume .  . in fact, the g4 and gs6 are both noticeably more powerful than the m9 and they only sounds slightly worse . in fact, i’d say than the m9’s maximum speaker volume is merely adequate . this time around, the m9 comes with dolby audio, all this means is that it comes with a useless setting that add excessive amounts of reverb to the speakers . the first thing you want to do when you fire up the m9 is to turn it it from “theater mode” to “music mode” . this essentially turns the dolby setting down . conclusion: . these days, htc is mostly a one phone company . sure, they have lower end devices like a few desires and depending on where you live maybe a phablet but htc is mostly about their one line . with that in mind, the m9 just isn’t a big improvement from the m8 - i hate to say it but with the m9, htc has really become irrelevant . i mean the m8 is a decent device and while the m9 should be an improvement, in many areas, it’s actually a step back . on paper, the m9 should be a contender . it’s got all the right ingredients but unfortunately, htc botched the recipe . lg’s last flagship, the g3 was one of the first phones to ship with a quad-hd 2560x1440 display and to be honest, it was slightly ahead of its time . while it boasted the highest resolution screen around, the screen itself didn’t really look any better than the competition but worse yet, the rest of it wasn’t quite as cutting edge . the camera while not terrible, wasn’t terribly good either . don’t forget that the processor was barely up to the task of driving the high res display . since then, samsung unleashed their gs6, which in many ways is a big step up from the gs5 which was was the g3’s contemporary . now lg has the g4; is it enough to compete with the gs6 . vs g3: . on paper, they’re not all the different but the g4 has a lot of tweaks that make it more than the sum of its parts . for example, both have quad-hd displays but the g4’s looks much sharper because lg has fixed the weird halos that appear on some text on the g3 that was never fixed even after the 5 . 0 update . the g4’s camera is quite a bit step up . the g3’s was a middling camera - it wasn’t horrible but it definitely wasn’t market leading . the g4’s is right up there with the gs6 at the top of the market .  . performance is also quite a bit step up . while the g4 snapdragon 808 has 6 cores, only 2 of them are higher performance cortex a57 cores . still, most tasks don’t require all 4 cores running at once so the difference is more on paper than something you’d notice in everyday usage . while neither is super thin, the curved back on both helps to make them feel a little smaller than they are . the g3’s curves only run longitudinally whereas the g4’s curves both run along both the latitude and longitude . vs samsung galaxy s6/s6 edge . this is the g4’s real competition . they match up well in many areas; the cameras are comparable, as are the displays . both have excellent multimedia chops with powerful headphone, amplifiers and speakers .  . the gs6 pulls ahead with a truly usable fingerprint reader which i much prefer over the g4’s custom knock pattern unlock . there’s also the gs6’s metal and glass body which is a bit more tactile than the g4’s plastic and leather . one area where there’s no contest is that the g4 has both a user removable battery which happens to be 20% larger and memory card slot . let me put it this way, samsung is really pushing the fact that the gs6 charges really quickly . the reason they have to do this is because many people will have to top it off . it’s actually samsung’s way of apologizing for giving the gs6 a lousy battery . another way to think of it, is if the g4 and gs6 were electric cars . the g4 would have a long enough range that most can wait till they get home to charge it . the gs6 on the other hand would charge faster but would require you to take time out of your day to add some juice . as for the gs6 edge, it’s a very sleek device but the sloped sides of the screen make it awful to use . on the other hand, i had no problems using the g4 . it fits well in my and and is predictable . both are great phones; you get more sizzle with the gs6 while the g4 is more about the steak . the g4 is the more practical choice while the gs6 with its metal and glass is a more emotional one . vs htc one m9: . i haven’t posted my m9 review yet because i’m working on mine simultaneously . i will say that i prefer the g4 . the m9 does have a nice metal body but that’s about the only advantage that it has . the leather covered back also helps to close the gap . while not terrible, the m9 camera isn’t particularly good either . it’s not terribly responsive, the camera software isn’t terribly intuitive . i’m also not a fan of htc’s sense software and find that it brings little benefit . then again, you could say the same thing about lg’s interface . on paper, the m9’s soc should be more powerful than the g4’s but when i test it, there isn’t much of a difference between the 2 devices . the differentiator is that the g4 comes with a slightly larger, removable battery . body: . the g4 is now the lone flagship that comes with a user-removable battery . sony, htc, samsung, motorola, apple all ship with sealed batteries . if you plan on keeping your phone for a while, a removable battery is really handy . you just buy a new battery and you’re done . you don’t have to find a repair shop to do it for you . you get 2 different back covers in the box . a plastic one one with a hammered metal finish (because brushed metal looking plastic is so 2012) or a slick leather one . the leather back looks sick (in a good way) . just look at it, they really grained the hell out of it . i guess i do have a minor complaint, the leather is really thin so it lacks a bit of the softness/suppleness you normally get with leather . the frame is made of plastic . note the chromed paint on it, it’s solid enough that it had be second guessing that it’s made from plastic . despite the large footprint, the g4 is a very solid phone with virtually no flexing when you twist it . check out the slick diamond pattern behind the glass on the bezel . like the g2 and g3, the g4 has no buttons on the sides . the power and volume keys are located on the back, just below the camera . since most users aren’t constantly pressing these buttons, it makes handing the g4 very straight forward . that said, getting used to having the buttons on the back does take some getting used to . i tend to put my finger where the camera is when i’m hunting for the volume buttons . still, you can always wake the g4 up by double tapping the screen or using one your own knock pattern to unlock it . then again, it’s not quite as simple as pressing the home button and then placing your finger on it to unlock it like you can on the gs6 or some iphones . if you take a lot of pictures the lack of buttons on the side really allow to hold the g4 very securely . just watch out if you’re shooting video because it’s easy to accidentally cover up one of the microphones . otherwise, the g4 is very easy to handle . the top and bottom of the front have plenty of space so there’s little chance of accidentally pressing the screen when you reach across with your thumb . these days heat is a big issue so you’re probably wondering how hot the g4 gets . while i didn't bother putting a thermometer to it, the g4 does get quite warm but only on the top part around the camera . it doesn’t get as toasty as the gs6 does . headphone jack, micro usb, microphone . microphone, ir blaster . since there are no buttons on the sides there isn't much to see . if you look carefully the front of the g4 has a slight curve to it . display: . lg calls the g4’s display a “quantum ips”, i asked lg what this means and was mildly disappointed that it doesn’t mean it has a quantum dot display . instead, it’s just a marketing term to refer to the fact that it’s “a quantum leap” forward . i guess they had to say something since they couldn’t increase the resolution . jokes aside, even though the resolution hasn’t changed, there’s quite a difference between the g4 and the g3 display . first off the blacks are much deeper . they’re not quite amoled black but they come pretty damn close . off the top of my head the g4 has the deepest  . consequently, colours on the g4 pop much more than they do on the g3 . lg manages to do this without totally over-saturating colours too . i don’t have any equipment to measure saturation but the reds and greens and blues on the chrome icon look well behaved on the g4 . it goes without saying that a 5 . 5” 2560x1440 display is insanely sharp and indeed that’s the case . actually, even though they have the same resolution, the g4’s looks much sharper because it doesn’t have those strange halos that the g3 does . if i may segue for a moment, i figured that the g3’s halos would go away after a few software updates but that never happened . since the blacks are so deep and the colours pop, i initially thought the g4’s display was brighter than the g3’s (which looks kind of washed out next to the g4) but after putting them side-by-side, i’d say the g3 is actually a tiny bit brighter . however, the awesome colour seems to come at a cost . the g4 loses a quite a bit of brightness when you don’t view it straight on . i tend to take a lot of pictures when i’m not holding the g4 right in front of me and the loss in brightness is very noticeable - especially outdoors because i have trouble framing my shots/videos . compared to the gs6 outdoors it’s noticeably brighter but once you go off-angle there isn’t a big difference between them . note how much dimmer the g4 (and m9) displays are compared to the 6 plus and gs6 edge . i suspect the g4's poor off-angle performance is caused by the curved front . straight on the g4 display is incredible but the loss in brightness off-angle really hurts its usefulness . overall, the g4 display is incredible . however it seems to come at the cost of off-angle viewability which in turn reduces outdoor performance . camera: . there’s been a lot of buzz about how good the g4 camera is so i was very curious to try it myself . while the camera sensor appears to be top notch, i think the real differentiator is the image stabilizer . just to clarify, i’m talking about ‘real’ stabilization where parts of the camera can actually move to counteract shake and not digital image stabilization which just reserves a few pixels at the edges of the frame to allow space for the image to shift around . i don’t remember which phone was the first to introduce it, but my lumia 920 from 3 or 4 years ago had it as does the nexus 5, nexus 6, lg g2, lg g3, note 4, gs6, htc one m7, etc . image stabilization hardware in a phone is nothing new . what’s different about the g4 stabilizer is that it works really well . i don’t have a rig setup to test it but when you shake the g4 it does an incredible job of reducing shake . it’s so good it doesn’t have to resort to using ‘tricks’ like a super wide angle lens (like on the gs6), using excessive amounts of digital stabilization (like on a blackberry) . lg tells me that the g4 can correct horizontal and vertical shake along with z-axis (forward and back) shake . the stabilizer is also able to correct up to 2 degrees of movement vs 1 degree on the g3 . you can quickly take a picture by pressing the volume down button twice - this will launch the camera, give you a second to frame your shot and then take the picture . i wonder where lg got the idea of this feature from? on a gs6, you can double tap the home button to launch the camera . i prefer samsung’s implementation over the lg one because you can do this from any screen with a gs6 . the lg double tap only seems to work when the phone is off . picture quality is excellent . these days, most cameras - even cheaper ones do well outdoors and that’s the case with the g4 . where it really sets itself apart is indoors . it’s amazing how well it does when there isn’t a lot of light and most of the time, it doesn’t even need to use super long exposures which it could since it has a very effective stabilizer . my only complaint about the g4 is that sometimes it takes a little longer to focus than the competition - especially the first shot, which usually takes a second or two . i’m not sure if this is a side effect of the faster than normal f/1 . 8 lens or if lg just tweaked the focus to make sure it gets focus but i did notice it . it also focuses more between shots which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it does make shot-to-shot speeds slower . there are 3 different shooting modes; simple, auto and advanced . advanced is a manual mode complete with: . white balance . manual focusing . exposure . iso shutter speed . exposure lock . histogram (i’m not joking) . note that there’s no aperture control as most phones only have a fixed aperture . it can even shoot in raw mode if jpg isn’t enough for you . raw files are saved as dng files . you can use the dng files to adjust the white balance yourself, sharpening, that sort of thing . one thing i wasn’t prepared to see is just how many lit/dead pixels the sensor has in dng mode during longer exposures . this doesn’t really affect anything since removing dead pixels from an image is very simple but it’s still quite shocking . i guess it also reminds us that it’s a true raw mode with no processing at all . what i really liked about the manual mode is that it’s actually fairly responsive and easy to use . i wouldn’t use it all the time but i’d definitely play with it occasionally - the manual focus (great for macros) and exposure lock are both very useful . speaking of macro, the g4 minimum focusing distance (mfd) is pretty impressive . you can get in really close - it’s comparable to the gs6/s6 edge/note 4/note edge all of which allow you to get in really close . each shooting mode produces slightly different looking pictures . i found that auto mode produced photos that sometimes have excessive sharpening - it gets really bad if there isn’t a lot of light . i liked the pictures i got from the advanced mode when i left everything default . pictures are a little more ‘normal’ looking . the only problem is that you lose burst mode in advanced mode . as good as the g4’s camera is, sometimes you’ll need burst to tip the odds in your favor that you’ll get a keeper . here are some comparison shots of my family room built-in . the shot was taken at night so there's no light coming from the outside . it's only lit by chandelier with 6 led (25 watt equivalent) bulbs . you can right click any of these images to view them at full resolution . note that the zoomed out shots are resized to 1600x1200 . the gs6 has the cleanest looking shot here but it missed the white balance . normally it's pretty good about white balance so this is an anomoly . the g4 is a bit over-sharpened . i would have gotten better results if i had used advanced mode . the iphone 6 plus looks like there is very light processing - it uses a fairly slow shutter speed (which isn't ideal) . the g3 does its best here but you the noise reduction takes up a lot of detail . the m9 with it's lack of image stabilization really hurts it here . it's forced to use a fairly high iso and even then it took me a few tries to get that shot . remember that awesome stabilizer i was talking about earlier? it allows for really smooth video - i didn’t do a side-by-side comparison but it reminds me of the stabilizer in my dedicated panasonic camcorder which is extremely effective . video looks great, the sensor is quite sensitive so indoor video stays relatively clean looking even when there isn’t a lot of light . unfortunately, the manual mode only works for photos so you can’t manually focus while shooting video . the microphone sounds great but it tends to pick up a lot of handling noise - i suspect it’s because the lack of buttons on the sides encourages you to hold the g4 much more securely . then again, it could indicate poor microphone placement . the stabilizer is so good that feature alone is making me think of packing a g4 just so i can use it shoot 4k video . lg has resisted the urge to fit a really wide lens on the front facing camera . i personally don’t like super wide front facing cameras but i guess this is a personal decision . i mean, i tend to use the selfie cam for just that, selfies . i don’t care if my camera can’t get me and 4 other friends in the same frame nor do i care about it capturing as much of the background as possible . you might have different priorities . i guess you could argue that you could always zoom in on a wide angle if you don’t want to capture so much . i’m not 100% sure of the best way to test a front facing camera . most of them have a fixed focus lens and are optimized to have their subject a few feet away . further, companies are under pressure to pack more megapixels into their cameras . at the same time, most of them usually have settings to soften things up so that they don’t they capture every single pore on your face which in turn eliminates all the extra details you get with more megapixels . the only thing that really matters to me is how well the front facing camera does in low light . as it turns out, this is very difficult to test because some manufacturers do more post processing than others . sorry for getting all loquacious about front facing cameras but there’s a lot to think about . none of these pictures looks good but out of these 4, i prefer the htc one m9 and the lg g4 . the m9 is a bit splotchy (it looks ‘ultrapixel-ish’) . the g4 has a tiny bit too much sharpening . the m9 also has the shallowest depth of field . is this because it’s fixed focus is set to focus closer or is it because it has the largest sensor . the iphone 6 plus doesn’t do a lot of lightening in post-processing so the picture is the darkest here . even though by far, it has the lowest megapixel sensor here . if you lighten the picture, it still captures a bit of detail compared to the others because it doesn’t try to remove too much of the noise . the gs6 does the worst here, the wide-angle lens makes for uninteresting look selfies and even though i turned the ‘beauty’ feature all the way down it still softens everything to the point that it looks like a watercolor painting . oh and btw, nice try making me look ‘beautiful’ - it’s not gonna happen . software: . the software hasn’t changed much from the lg g3 . it’s still a bit cartoonish/ugly looking . check out the pull down, it has 2 gears on it, which gear does what . also note how the pull down switches take up half the space, i prefer how stock lollipop allows you to pull down once for your notifications and then a second time to see your switches . like the g3, the g4 likes to try to hand out lots of cards with what it thinks are useful bits of information . it’s basically a clone of google now . while i don’t use the split screen apps much, it’s nice that this feature is available . like the gs6 and m9, the g4 has an infrared blaster located at the top so you can use it to control your home theater equipment . unlike them, the g4 doesn’t use peel’s useless remote software that requires you to subscribe to cable to satellite to be of any use . that means the g4’s remote software is actually useful . another useful carry-over program is quick memo, which lets you take a screenshot and then mark it up with your finger . performance: . under the hood is a hexa-core qualcomm snapdragon 808 soc . if you’re keeping track of other recent flagships, the htc one m9 is packing a snapdragon 810 while the gs6 pair have a custom samsung exynos 7420 . all feature a high performance arm cortex a57 cluster paired with an energy sipping cortex a53 cluster . the a57 cluster in the snapdragon 810 and exynos has 4 cores while the 808 only has 2 cores . so the 810 and 808 are twice as fast right? technically, yes but not really . the a57 cores run very hot so in the case of the 810 in the m9, it’s not always able to run them at full speed . another thing to consider is that the each additional core usually brings diminishing returns when it comes to performance . something else to consider is that the a57 cores run hot . after a few minutes the gs6 feels like a nuclear rod, the g4 has half the cores and while it doesn’t get quite as hot it still gets quite warm . doing anything taxing also causes battery to drain at an alarm rate (much more so on the gs6) . i got a feeling that the a57 cores aren’t really ready right now but due to market pressures they were rushed out the door .  . i need to point out that the software on my g4 is benchmark aware . it won’t allow me to run benchmarks unless the phone doesn’t have a network connection . is this because lg doesn’t want scores showing up on benchmark sites before launch? is lg trying something underhanded like overclocking the soc or maybe relaxing throttling clock speed limits for benchmarks (i have no idea)? do they just want to make sure the phone isn’t working on anything else while the benchmark is running which could result in lower scores (probably) . this has the side effect of not allowing certain benchmarks at all because they’re not able to connect to the internet to download files they need to run . you can trick some of them by turning on airplane mode, launching the program and then disabling airplane mode via the notification area pull down switches but it doesn’t work for all of them . as such, the only benchmarks i could run are peacekeeper, antutu and 3dmark unlimited . the g4 knocks it out of the park with peacekeeper . it’s about 25% faster than the gs6 and htc one m9 .  . in antutu, i suspect the fact that the g4 has 2 less high performance cores than the htc one m9 and gs6 results in its lackluster score . then again, what do you use more? the browser or do you run antutu constantly . 3d mark unlimited runs off screen so the m9 with it’s lower resolution display doesn’t have an advantage here . i’d run 3d mark extreme which runs on-screen but all the devices here can easily hit v-sync so they’d all have similar scores . check it out, the soc appears to report it’s maximum speed as 1 . 2ghz . i wouldn’t pay too much attention to this as the scores indicate that it can run quite a bit faster - 808’s are supposed to run their a57’s at 1 . 8ghz . finally i included pc mark which i don't normal use . personally, i don’t pay much attention to benchmarks . i want a powerful phone so i don’t have to wait for it . i want it to launch my camera as fast as possible, ditto for chrome, and my favorite video games . the gs6 has the highest benchmark scores out of all the phones i have tried so i figured i put it next to the g4 to see which one launches programs faster . with 2 extra arm cortex a57 cores which are clocked faster than the g4 along with ddr4 ram and speedy ufs 2 . 0 storage the gs6 has a bit of an advantage . to see which is faster, i killed all open applications on both phones, put them side-by-side and then launched each app simultaneously . i was surprised but the cameras on both phones take exactly the same amount of time to launch . when it comes to chrome, the g4 is half a step faster and drawing pages . its high peacekeeper score is the real deal . the tables are turned for plants vs zombies 2 which the gs6 consistently edging out the g4 by a small amount . my point is even though the g4 isn’t a hero at benchmarks, it’s competitive with the best out there - no one’s going to find it slow . media capabilities: . the built in speaker is extremely powerful . lg claims the g4 has a 1 watt speaker and a 2 watt amplifier . the gs6 is another phone with a rocking speaker but they sound slightly different . the gs6 has a more balanced, tuned sound . the g4 doesn’t sound cheap but it’s lacks some of the gs6’s thumping bass . they’re both about the same when it comes to maximum volume . no surprises here, the headphone jack has plenty of volume and should be able to drive any pair of headphones you throw at it . it also has excellent sound quality . you get 32gb of storage (22 . 7gb available) . if that’s not enough, you can add microsd cards which currently top out at 200gb . as a phone: . the earpiece maximum volume is above average (average = iphone 6 plus) but lags behind the gs6 . ditto for the speakerphone, which is louder than average but not as loud as the gs6 . rf performance is average . conclusion: . the lg g4 is a much more balanced device compared to the gs6/gs6 edge . it matches the gs6 camera, has nearly as much performance, has similar multi-media capabilities, has a nice leather back and is solid . when it comes to practicality, it one-ups the samsungs with a removable battery which is 20% larger and a microsd slot . while i’m not sure if it’s by choice, these days microsoft has decided to devote most of its attention to the more affordable end of the market . here’s blu’s entry level windows phone, the win jr lte which surprise, surprise, has support for lte at a sub $100 usd price point . entry level phones are more about what compromises you have to make to reach a certain price point and whether they make sense so let’s check it out . what about the motorola moto g first gen . first things first, the moto g is now a year and a half old . when it came out, we were all amazed at how much you got for the price . however, in that year and a half, the entry level has moved quickly and now the first gen moto g doesn’t feel quite as revolutionary as it used to . just to clarify, i’m talking about the moto g’s with 8gb of storage, no lte and no microsd . still, the moto g has 4 features that give it a leg up on the win jr . first off, it comes with a 1280x720 display which is much sharper than the jr’s . you also get 1gb of ram, which allows it to run pretty much anything you can throw at it, along with 8gb of storage, which gives you some room to grow . then there’s the android vs windows choice . windows phone has its merits and indeed, some prefer it over alternative . however, i’m guessing most would rather have android . neither has a very good camera but i’d say the jr wins out by a small margin . really, the reason to get the jr is for the lte, dual sim support and removable storage . the jr also has a newer snapdragon 410 vs the 400 in the moto g but to be honest, the difference between them isn’t enough to choose one over the other unless both phones are otherwise exactly the same . these days, you can pick up a locked moto g first gen for around $100 - if you don’t need the jr’s extras then it’s a more well-rounded phone . what about nokia lumia 635 . the lumia 635 costs a tiny bit more than the jr but for the extra cash, it comes with 8gb of storage instead of the 4gb you find on the jr, a better camera (though it lacks the jr’s flash) and a better set of screen coatings . the jr does come with a more recent snapdragon and room for an extra sim card (gsm/edge only) . if you can swing it, you’re probably better off with the 635 . body: . while i’ve gotten used to carrying large phones around with me like my iphone 6 plus and nexus 6, it’s a bit of fresh air to use something as small as the 4 . 5” blu win jr lte . it doesn’t take up much space in my pocket and fits perfectly in my hand . like its bigger brother, the win hd lte (shouldn’t it be called the win sr lte?), you can get the jr in some crazy colours . mine is bright yellow (or is it green?) . unlike the sr, the jr’s back is painted with a hard finish which should be much more practical than the sr’s soft-touch finish . note the finish on the buttons . the buttons themselves are decent, they protrude just enough and have some feel when you press them in . check out the crazy green chrome finish on the sides . the back cover comes off to reveal the battery, microsd and 2 microsim slots . i think it’s a pretty pleasant looking phone . despite the price tag, it doesn’t look (or feel) particularly cheap . display: . you get a 4 . 5” 854x480 ips display . don’t forget that the blu has separate menu buttons so the bottom of the display isn’t reserved for buttons . some lower-end lumia’s use on-screen ones which eat into the screen real estate . the 4 . 5” screen’s 854x480 resolution is stretched pretty thin at just 217ppi, the display is a bit blurry . that said, it’s not so bad that you can’t get used to it . just watch out, it’s not sharp enough to let you read most non-mobile optimized webpages without zooming in first . like other blu phones, the win jr doesn’t have the greatest oleophobic coating on it . once it gets dirty it’s very difficult to clean . you can tell that there is a gap between the digitizer and the actual screen though this doesn’t really affect how you use the jr . the anti-glare coating isn’t very good, so you might have trouble seeing the display outdoors . to be honest, while the display isn’t awesome, it’s not exactly terrible either . it works perfectly fine indoors and has decent view-angles . camera: . you get a 5 megapixel camera on the back with autofocus and an led flash . it actually focuses fairly quickly  . the camera can’t handle scenes where you have a darkly lit subject and a bright background (like when you’re indoors and have a window in the background) . image quality isn’t as good as the nokia lumia 635 . the jr is kind of noisy so indoors pictures can get really soft looking because of the noise reduction . colour doesn’t look too bad though sometimes thing look a bit dull outdoors .  . overall, the jr is serviceable outdoors while indoors, you’ll need to keep it very still and stick to static subjects . video can be recorded at 1080p . if you’re going to record any video, do yourself a favour and pick up a microsd because out of the box, the storage is basically full already .  . video doesn’t look very good . the microphone is easy to overdrive and it picks up lots of handling noise . another way to think of it is this, many phones in this price range are horrible, the jr is a step up from that . software: . the jr only comes with 512mb of ram . while some people will say that 512mb of perfectly adequate for windows phone, it will sometimes keep you from running certain apps . 512mb does go further than it does on android but not that much . something else to consider is that the jr only comes with 4gb of storage of which less than 1gb is available to the user . this means you’re almost out of storage the moment you turn it on for the first time . after snapping a few pictures i didn’t have enough room to run a firmware update . fortunately, a bunch of the pre-installed apps are actually removable . check out my win hd lte review for more on what i think about the win jr’s software which is more or less in the same situation: . performance: . i was pretty excited that the jr comes with a 64bit 1 . 2ghz quad-core snapdragon 410 soc . it’s not a high-end processor but it’s still pretty fancy for an entry-level phone like the jr . my first intuition was that it would excel at games since it has a lower resolution display which means there are less pixels to push . however, the jr’s meager 512mb of ram keeps it from running gfx bench . you’d think that the snapdragon 410 should be up to the task of browsing the web, but browsing the web isn’t very smooth and the low resolution screen makes things worse . most webpages aren’t really legible unless you zoom in . in the end, the snapdragon 410 is a bullet point on the jr’s checklist but the lack of ram and resolution act as bottlenecks . media capabilities: . the built-in speaker’s volume is slightly above average . it also sounds a lot better than the win hd lte . the headphone jack sounds good and is quite powerful . remember, the jr only comes with 4gb of storage most of which is taken up by windows so if you’re going to store any files on it, do yourself a favour and get a microsd . as a phone: . the earpiece isn’t very powerful, ditto for the speakerphone . rf performance is below average . battery life is decent . the small screen and lack of ram really help to keep the battery out of trouble . conclusion: . part of me is wondering why anyone would bother putting lte into a phone as inexpensive as the win jr lte . at this price point, the extra money spent on adding lte could be spent on other features like a bigger/better screen, better camera, etc . however, if you look at it from blu’s standpoint it makes perfect sense; adding lte allows it to work with more operators, better compatibility expands the jr’s audience . don’t forget that lte has been around for around 4 years now so it was bound to trickle down eventually . still, the addition of lte means that the win jr doesn’t make as much progress in other areas as it could have had they omitted it . if i could could make changes to the jr, the first thing i would do is add more ram followed by more storage . next up, would be improving the screen coatings, followed by adding more resolution, and then improving the camera . given the price tag, i don’t have any massive complaints about it . however, at the same time, while it does raise the bar for an entry-level phone, overall it still needs work . last year, one of my favorite lower cost phones was blu’s 5 . 0c hd . it combined ‘good enough’ specs with an interesting, eye-searing neon pink case . it targeted the “i want a decent phone that’s also fun’ segment and came through in spades . of course, the 5 . 0c runs android so if you were looking for something of the windows phone persuasion there was the blu win hd . now it’s been updated with the added goodness of lte, let’s check it out: . alcatel onetouch idol 3: . if you can swing it, the idol 3 costs $50 usd more . if you’re a budget, this is a lot of dough . still, i suggest you double and triple check your sofa crack for any extra change . the idol 3 is worth the extra dough . unless you need dual sims or windows phone, the idol 3 one or two-ups the blu across the board . the display, performance, storage capacity, camera, speakers are all better .  . zte grand x plus: . in canada, another competitor is the zte grand x+ which you can pick up on fido for $199 . 99 cdn locked . on paper they’re quite similar: 5” high def ips displays, 8gb of storage, 8mp cameras, lte, etc . the grand x+ has double the ram while the blu counters with a slightly larger battery, space for 2 sim cards and a newer snapdragon 410 soc (zte has a 400) . nokia lumia 635: . if you’re looking for a windows phone and are on a budget, you might consider the nokia lumia 635 . specs-wise, the blu is one class ahead of the 635 . it has a newer processor, larger higher resolution display, more ram and more megapixels, a camera flash, dual sim card slots . however, for the money, the 635 is a pretty competent phone . while it’s cheap there’s nothing inherently terrible about it . it’s just a well rounded package - just make sure you pick it up when it’s on sale . they go on sale for a wallet friendly $99 - $109 unlocked every now and then . body: . the front of the phone really reminds me of a blackberry z10 . i really love how blu makes their phones available in crazy colours like neon yellow . it’s also great that they bundled a matching clear yellow tpu case and a screen protector . unfortunately, i wasn’t able to photograph the brushed metal look on the top and bottom of the front of the phone . there’s a soft touch finish on the removable back cover . if you’re planning on putting the blu in the back pocket of your jeans watch out, the dye in the denim will rub off onto the phone and is very difficult to remove so make sure you use the included case . i wish the rear cover required just a tiny bit more force to take off . while i wouldn’t go as far as to say it feels cheap, i found that removing the case often caused the back cover to come off too . taking the cover off reveals that the battery is actually taped in place . note the 2 microsim slots along with the microsd . notice the interesting finish on the buttons . while i wouldn’t say the the blu looks cheap, aside from the terrific colour, it doesn’t look terribly special either . i think a lot of it has to do with the thick black frame around the screen . i upsets the design a little . display: . there’s something funny about about the screen, when you scroll the screen slowly, it stutters . the fact that windows phone requires a lot of scrolling up and down exacerbates this issue . i’m not sure if it’s a wonky digitizer or maybe a function of the poor oleophobic coating but the problem is really noticeable . if you pick one up, for the love of god, don’t put the included screen protector on, it makes the stuttering much worse . i found this out the hard way, because before i started using the blu i thought i’d put the screen protector on . if you do decide to use it, make sure your screen is very clean before once you put it it’s very difficult to remove without causing bubbling . this happens because the oleophobic coating on the screen is not very effective . you won’t be able to use tape to take it off to remove pieces of dust after the fact without having to lift it with your fingernail first and creating a spot where it won’t stick . this happened to me on the top right corner of the screen . the screen is an absolute fingerprint magnet . since the coating isn’t up to snuff, cleaning the screen is not a trivial task . you’ll need to apply a lot of pressure when wiping it or you’ll have to use a liquid cleaner . as far as resolution goes, i’ve tested a couple of 5” android phones with hd (1280x720) displays and i’ve always said that they’re plenty sharp . most people won’t notice that their 290ppi is just short of the 320ppi or so that you need for a really sharp display . however, in the case of the blu i do notice the jaggedness more . windows phone’s skinny white text on a black background is really brutal for screens and makes the steps in the letter “a” and “v” more noticeable . while the blu has an ips display, it’s more of a midrange panel . it looks fine straight on, but it loses a bit of light off-angle . all in all though, aside from the lousy coatings, the blu offers a decent display for the money . input: . i don’t normally say much about input . these days, it’s very rare to find a phone with a bad on-screen keyboard . the default ios/android/blackberry and windows phone keyboards are all excellent and it’s been a long time since i’ve had any reason to complain . however, while the default windows phone keyboard is awesome, for some reason it works horribly on the blu . i think the source of this problem is the same as why the blu screen stutters when you scroll . if you’re a slow typist you probably won’t notice it but if you’re typing really quickly, half your key presses don’t register . it’s bad enough that the normally very capable windows auto-correct can’t work its magic with the blu . camera: . it used to be that all windows phones came with a dedicated camera button . it never occurred to me how important this feature was until models that lacked this started to hit the market . on android and ios this isn’t a big deal because both allow you to launch the camera quickly - even when the screen is locked . however, in the case of the blu, you’ll need to turn the phone on, unlock and and then look for shortcut to the camera app to launch it . this is really, really annoying and i suspect it may even be a deal breaker for some windows phone users who are used to this . otherwise, it’s relatively fast for a windows phone in terms of both launch time and capture speeds .  . to be honest, i wasn’t expecting much from the camera, blu’s known for making colourful, affordable phones that don’t take themselves too seriously, not for packing incredible cameras . as it turns out, i was completely wrong . while it doesn’t compare with a flagship i was shocked by how capable the blu’s camera is . it can’t freeze action indoors but if you hold it very still you’ll get pretty decent results . the software is smart too so it knows when to push the sensor and when it doesn’t need to . for example, when lighting is really bad it will max out the iso but since the sensor is decent, it doesn't always need to do this indoors . noise is nicely controlled so that it balances colour, detail and grain . i don’t have the idol 3 around right now to compare with but the blu camera blows the motorola moto g 2nd gen’s camera out of the water . video quality looks good but there doesn’t appear to be any image stabilization (digital or optical) so you have to hold the blu really, really still . the microphone sounds alright but it picks up a lot of handling noise so again, you have to be really careful how you hold it . software: . the last few windows phones that i’ve tried were all nokia/microsoft lumia models, all of them came with nokia’s exclusive extras like their pro camera along with a bunch of camera related apps, mix radio and a few others . you might miss them if you’re coming from a nokia windows phone and use them regularly . it’s worth mentioning that the blu is not able to download these apps from the microsoft store either . still, the only really important apps that aren’t pre-installed are here maps and here drive which you can download from the store . otherwise, microsoft doesn’t allow oem’s much latitude when it comes to customizing the software on their windows phone so in that sense, the blu is just like any other windows phone . this also means that the blu will receive timely updates microsoft when releases them . this is very different from android where you typically have to wait and see if you’ll get updates if ever . performance: . i already mentioned this earlier but it’s worth repeating . the blu has a strange problem where it stutters when you scroll . this makes for a really bad first impression . i usually run the peacekeeper benchmark in chrome on android and ios to compare different devices across the 2 platforms . since chrome isn’t available for windows phone i’m stuck using internet explorer . since we’re not doing an apples to apples or should i say, an apple to android comparison, i wouldn’t make any buying decisions based on the results . still, i’m a bit surprised at the blu’s poor showing . does it mean that it ships with a really slow browser? i didn’t do side-by-side comparisons but i do find myself waiting more than i’m used to . recently, i noticed that gfx bench, one of my favorite graphics benchmarks for ios and android is also available for windows phone . however, while the ios and android versions use the opengl api, the windows phone version uses microsoft’s direct x . for some reason the windows phone directx scores are drastically lower than the opengl scores on an android phone with similar hardware . is this because directx for windows phone isn’t as mature as opengl is on and android? possibly . does the directx test have higher quality? maybe . is gfx bench not as optimized for windows phone as it is on ios or android? perhaps . anyways, i hate to say it but windows phone isn’t the greatest choice if you’re a gamer . sure, they have a few titles that integrate with the xbox but overall, you’re better off on ios or android if you game a lot . in general, it feels like gaming titles come to ios and android first . windows phone only gets it after microsoft pays the developer to port it .  . in that sense, the gaming benchmark scores are more of a curiosity than anything else . media capabilities: . the built-in speaker it has limited range and distorts when you turn it up . it’s one of the worst i have tried in recent years . the headphone jack has slightly boosted bass . audio isn’t terrible but it’s not as clear and crisp as most other phones i’ve tried . that said i think most will find the headphone jack to be adequate . you get 8gb of storage which can be expanded using microsd cards . as a phone: . the speakerphone is pretty loud but it sounds over-driven so it sounds pretty annoying when you turn the volume up . the earpiece is also pretty loud and fortunately, sounds much better than the speakerphone . i tested the blu on telus and found that its hspa performance was below average . the 2500mah battery is well sized for the screen and soc and should last most users a day . conclusion: . if you’re looking for a fun windows phone that doesn’t take itself too serious you should take a look at blu win hd lte . the bright case is interesting and unique plus its display and camera are both surprisingly good . if the bright colour isn’t enough, the fact that it’s only available at the microsoft store means there’s a good chance you’ll have something different . that said, it has some significant drawbacks; the built-in speaker is mediocre at best and the display has some strange problems which cause it to stutter when you touch which also makes the keyboard difficult to use . the blu faces some stiff competition both north and south of it’s $199 usd/$229 can price tag . if you’re looking for a windows phone then the blu is well priced but if you’re willing to consider an android competitor then there are better options . if you’re familiar with alcatel onetouch, recently their portfolio has had 2 parallel families of devices . the idol x line had beefier specs like full hd displays but no lte, plus they utilized mediatek soc’s . the idol s line used qualcomm soc and some include lte but they’re less attractive on paper . now we have the idol 3, which appears to consolidate the 2 lines . it has a full hd display and is the first device i’ve tried with qualcomm’s 64bit octa-core snapdragon 615 processor . looking down the spec sheet, you’ll find many features from last year’s flagships like the 5 . 5” fhd display i mentioned, along with a 13 megapixel camera, 2gb of ram, stereo speakers and a large battery that approaches 3000mah . however, one thing that’s decidedly un-flagship about the idol 3 is the price . you can pick it up for only $249 . 99 usd unlocked direct from alcatel onetouch . it occupies a part of the market that is currently not very crowded . while there are bunch of less capable phones that cost less than $200 and many flagships that cost $500 and up, $250 is a pretty lonely place . when i was trying to think of competitors, flagship alternatives like the oneplus one and nexus 5 cost a bit more than the idol 3 while budget stalwarts like the moto g 2nd gen and zte grand x plus are a bit cheaper . i guess right now, the idol 3 is competing with the the used and refurbished market . what about the alcatel oneplus idol x+ . off the top of my head, the only phone i can think of that costs similar money is it’s predecessor, the idol x+ . the x+ has an octa-core mediatek mt6589 soc . it has 32bit arm cortex a7 cores running at 2ghz . this allows it to beat the idol 3 in certain benchmarks . however, its graphics performance is weaker which makes the idol 3 a more balanced phone . the idol 3 also has a much better camera and screen . it also comes with android 5 . 0 whereas the x+ is still running 4 . 4 . i’ll be frank, aside from some benchmarks, the idol 3 is far better and balanced phone in every aspect . body: . i’m not sure if all idol 3’s will come with the same packaging but mine came in a pretty cool box . in case you’re wondering, the case doesn’t actually have a lock on it . one of the idol’s signature features is that the front has a symmetrical design so it doesn’t matter which way you’re holding it . it’s an interesting idea but it’s kind of the answer to a question no one asked . i guess you could argue that you don’t need to think as hard when you pick up the idol but the thing is, the power button isn’t in the ‘correct’ spot if you hold the idol upside down . further, the camera isn’t in the greatest spot when you hold it upside down so your fingers might be blocking it . the same goes for the front facing one too .  . the transition from different orientations is pretty cool . otherwise, it’s telling that this feature is turned off by default . alcatel must have learned about making a fuss about a new feature but turning off by default from samsung . to be honest, the symmetrical front isn’t terribly interesting to look at either . i love minimalist design as much as the next person but the idol is a bit bland looking - too much symmetry is boring - there’s no tension in the design to help draw attention to any of the detailing . still, the sides are quite intriguing . the curved chrome bezel blends seamlessly with the grooved finish . there’s a brushed metal looking finish on the back . for some reason, the power button is all the way on the left side near the top . since the idol has a large-ish 5 . 5” screen this puts the power button way out of reach for right handers . the buttons themselves aren’t bad . they stick out just enough so that they’re easy to find and they have a good but not great tactile response . the bezel is very narrow so using the idol with one hand is trickier than usual . it’s more of a 2- handed device . i don’t usually mention sim card trays but the idol’s is a really great idea; there’s room for both the micro sim and a microsd . the machined finish around the speaker holes is classy but i found they attracted a lot of dust which was hard to remove without a microfiber cloth . if you look carefully at my pictures i wasn’t able to get them completely clean . if you use a generic charging stand, the microusb port is oriented towards the user like a samsung phone but it’s offset to the side . attachment 124716 . if you don’t know what i’m talking about, nexus and htc devices have a microusb port which is facing away so often times, they face backwards when you put them on a charging stand that wasn’t specifically designed for them . while the details look pretty convincing, when you touch the idol there’s no doubt its made of plastic . it’s a well finished phone but you won’t mistake it for a flagship because it’s not terribly tactile . that said, reasonably solid phone, there’s very little flexing when you twist it . i don’t see any screws on the body so i’m guessing you’ll need to melt a lot of glue if you ever have to change the battery . display: . you get a 5 . 5”, 1920x1080 ips lcd display . with a pixel density of over 400ppi, it’s plenty sharp . keen readers will notice that these are the same specs you’ll find on the iphone 6 plus and oneplus one . alcatel onetouch boasts that the screen has been tuned by technicolor . straight on, the display looks great . alcatel resisted the temptation to oversaturate it so colour is pleasant and looks reasonably accurate . blacks are excellent for an lcd display . off-angle the display is quite good - there’s some brightness loss but contrast shift is minimal . it’s very bright and works well outdoors in direct sunlight . the idol 3 just might have the best screen for any phone under $500 . i can’t think of anything cheaper that has a better screen . it’s not just a nice screen for the money, it’s a nice screen, period . camera: . the back has a 13 megapixel camera with autofocus and a led flash . it’s actually a sony imx214 imager which can also be found on the nexus 6 and oneplus one . in front is a 8 megapixel unit . that’s not bad considering that the nexus 6 and oneplus one both cost more than the idol . to be fair, no one buys the nexus 6 or oneplus one because they think they have awesome cameras but then again, the 6 and the one’s are what i’d consider adequate . the lens has a fairly wide angle - i’m guessing around 28mm with a somewhat slow aperture of f/2 . 65 . compared to the nexus 6 (i don’t have a oneplus one handy), the idol lags by quite a bit . the nexus 6 has a much faster f/2 lens and image stabilization so it’s able to use lower iso values indoors which results in cleaner looking pictures . this also makes the idol a bad choice if you’re trying to stop motion like when you’re chasing kids around . then again, the nexus is pretty bad at that too . the result is that the idol has to use high iso values, this results in noisy pictures . however, it also uses really strong noise reduction algorithms . the result is that images can sometimes look splotchy . the splotches also eliminate a lot of fine details from pictures . to be fair, you probably won’t notice this unless you zoom in a little bit . this limits your flexibility because you can’t really crop them without losing a lot of detail . video is also severely over-processed, so everything has a mild watercolor effect . in addition, there is overly-aggressive digital image stabilization so things get fuzzy whenever the phone detects movement . the microphone picks up very clean audio but it also captures a lot of handling noise . given that the same imaging sensor is capable of serviceable photos in the oneplus one and nexus 6, i was expecting a little more from the idol’s camera . if anything, the idol is a bit of a reminder; having a decent sensor isn’t enough, lens, stabilization and tuning play a large role in helping it reach its potential . a good analogy is that of a car, there’s more to it than just the engine . i don’t think the front-facing camera has autofocus (most don’t have af) . the lens is a bit wider than normal . what i didn’t like is that the fixed focus lens can’t focus on anything closer than 18” away . it will give you out of focus images if you hold it close enough that your face fits in the frame . i guess you’re supposed to use the digital zoom if you want to do this so that you can hold it further away . otherwise, i got serviceable images from it though, i wish they put a lower resolution sensor that’s more sensitive . indoors, it uses relatively slow shutter speeds so you have to make sure you’re holding it very still . software: . out of the box, the idol comes with android lollipop 5 . 02 . android is up to version 5 . 1 now so i’m mildly disappointed that it didn’t come with 5 . 1 but then again, the difference between 5 . 02 and 5 . 1 is minor . i like how you can double tap the screen to turn it on or off . for some reason, this feature is turned off by default . alcatel includes their own browser (what’s wrong with chrome?), music player and image viewer along with the google mandated versions of those apps .  . alcatel’s android overlay blends in well with android l . it’s mostly a few tweaks here and there . this includes some extra shortcuts on the home screen, a close all function on the task switcher, some extra switches on the pull down, etc . still, i’m a bit confused as to why there’s only 11gb of storage available . while it’s definitely not stock, it doesn’t feel particularly bloated either . performance: . powering the show is a 64bit qualcomm snapdragon 615 soc . in case you’re wondering, right now qualcomm has 3 classes of 64bit soc’s on the market . there’s the entry to mid-range snapdragon 410 which has four arm cortex a53 cores paired with an adreno 306 gpu . the snapdragon 810 occupies the high-end with four cortex a53’s, four higher performance cortex a57 cores and an adreno 430 . the idol has a snapdragon 615 which targets mid to upper-midrange phones with eight cortex a53 cores . half run at 1ghz while the other half at 1 . 5ghz along with an adreno 405 . to me, all 3 soc’s provide adequate performance for everyday tasks, the real difference between them lies in how well they’re able to drive different display resolutions . the 810 is meant for 1920x1080 and up displays . the 615 handles up to 1920x1080 while the 410 is best at 1280x720 or less . in that sense, the 615 is well matched with the idol’s 1920x1080 display . the idol 3’s predecessor, the idol x+, has a mediatek mt6589 soc which has eight 32bit arm cortex-a7 processors clocked at 2ghz . i’m also going to compare it to the moto g 2nd gen (a bit cheaper) and the nexus 5 (getting hard to find and more expensive) . i’d include the oneplus one but i don’t have one lying around .  . i’ll also toss a samsung galaxy s5 into the mix since its snapdragon 801 is something you’d find in many of last year’s flagships . here's a comparison of how powerful the cores are in each phone: . the top part are single core scores while the bottom half is how powerful all the cores together are . benchmarks slots the idol between a snapdragon 800/801 and the 400/410: . it does well in futuremark’s peacekeeper browser benchmark running in chrome . like i mentioned earlier, graphics is where the differences in their socs really shows up . the gap between the high end and everything else is quite pronounced . note that i ran the benchmark using each device’s native resolution . i didn't include the idol x+ because it won't run the manhattan benchmark because it has an older gpu that only supports older versions of opengl . to accommodate the idol x+ i also included the on-screen t-rex benchmark . here you can see the gap between the idol x+ and idol 3's gpu . here are the antutu scores . subjectively, most of the time the idol is very smooth but it occasionally stutters a little when you’re switching tasks, more so than a snapdragon 800 series . again, qualcomm has done a good job of differentiating their offerings . media capabilities: . these days, companies have been emphasizing the sound quality of their phone’s speakers . whether they give it a name like htc’s boomsound, sony’s x-loud or they just install a kick-a$$ pair of front-facing speakers like the moto g2/x2/nexus 6 everyone’s been upping their game . with that in mind, the idol has a pair of front-facing stereo speakers . i’ll be honest, given the idol’s price point, i was skeptical about how good they’d sound . turns out my skepticism was completely misplaced . they’re one of the best pair available on any phone at any price point . they’re about as powerful as the nexus 6’s . they have good range too (for a phone) . if i’m going to nit pick, i wish alcatel reigned in the treble and reverb just a little bit . but overall, they’re pretty damn impressive . the headphone amp sounds just fine . while it’s not as powerful as some recent flagships, i thought they were more than adequate for my needs . included with the alcatel music player is the ability to scratch your music using an on-screen record . i’m not sure how often anyone is going to use this but i thought it was a fun feature . while the idol has 16gb of storage, only around 10gb of it is available for use . still, considering the idol’s price tag and the fact that it ships with android l, this is perfectly acceptable . you can add microsd cards if you need more space . as a phone: . incoming audio is clean . maximum earpiece volume is average . maximum speakerphone volume is also average . rf performance is slightly below average . there is support for lte bands 2/4/5/7/12/17 along with volte (voice over lte) . you get a 2910mah battery which is well sized for a 5 . 5” phone with relatively low power a53 cores . even power users probably can leave their external batteries at home . if that’s not enough, i like how you can choose which programs are able to run in the background to save power . this option is in settings -> apps . conclusion: . all in all, the alcatel idol 3 acquits itself well even before you take the affordable price tag into account . the screen, speakers and battery life are all top notch plus you get lte . the idol 3 proves you don’t need to break the bank or sign a contract to get a solid phone . that said, not everything is perfect, the body and build aren’t very inspiring, the camera needs a lot of work and the rf is slightly below average but the affordable price tag assuages these shortcomings . the lumia 830 is marketed as an affordable flagship here in canada . for around $400, you get a phone with a slick metal frame, a 10 megapixel camera with image stabilization, running windows phone 8 . 1 . it’s tailor made for people on a “lite” type contract, who only want to spend slightly more than they used to, but also don’t want to drop too much on a new handset . what about the google nexus 5 . off the top of my head, the first competitor that comes to mind is the google nexus 5 . it’s priced at about the same level and also comes with a 5” display . both, also receive regular updates from their respective os providers . both have built-in qi charging, both have roughly the same sized batteries (2200 vs 2300mah) and both are endowed with image stabilization . each also comes with 16gb of built-in storage . the nexus 5 has a few key advantages: first off, it comes with a considerably more powerful snapdragon 800 display . it also has double the ram, a slightly sharper, higher resolution display . these are important, noticeable differences . the 830 counters with a slightly higher resolution camera (10mp vs 8mp), a metal frame, microsd card slot and a removable battery . really, the big story here is that the nexus comes with double the ram, a faster processor and a higher resolution screen .  . while i do like the 830’s metal frame, removable battery and storage and think that the camera is marginally better, the 830 is a few classes behind in the processing power department . if you can pick up both for about the same price, you should definitely consider the nexus unless you absolutely, positively must have a windows phone . what about the zte grand x plus . a more intriguing comparison would be how well the 830 handles itself against a low cost android competitor like the zte grand x plus . spec-wise, it compares more favorably: both have 5” 1280x720 displays, snapdragon 400 processors, removable batteries and memory card slots . you get a slick metal frame with the 830 along with a higher-resolution image stabilized lens . the zte gxp is endowed with double the ram . while i think that the 830 has a slightly better display and camera, the difference isn’t large enough to justify the price difference . you can pick up a gxp for $200 locked on fido which is just a phenomenal deal . the nokia canada site states that the lumia 830 supports lte bands 1, 3, 7, 8 and 20 . i have serious doubts that this is aside from a few phones from rogers, most lte phone sold in canada support at least band 4 . also, on telus, they only have lte on bands 4 and 2 right now . body: . one thing that does scream flagship is the body, specifically, the edges . it’s a square metal frame with slightly rounded edges to make it comfortable to hold . it’s much nicer than the exaggerated hard metal chamfered edges on the samsung galaxy alpha/note 4 . heck, i think its slicker than the an iphone 6/6 plus or even a htc one m9 . a lot of it is due to the minimalist design - sometimes less is more . while the edges are metal, the back is plastic . you can peel it off to reveal the sim card slot, microsd and battery . the cover fits just fine but gap it leaves is a little bigger than i'd like to see . i wish the buttons stuck out a little more plus they could be a tiny bit stiffer . unlike the 635, its less expensive brother, the 830 uses separate menu buttons instead of on-screen ones . i just love the way connectors look on the metal body . minimalism at it's best . display: . the 5” display has a resolution of 1280 x 720 with a ppi 296 . in terms of sharpness, i’d say it’s reasonably sharp - you’d rarely notice any jaggedness which is important because windows phone uses skinny fonts which are really tough on displays that don’t have enough ppi . colour is decent . viewing angles are quite good, there’s minimal contrast shift and the brightness drops gradually . black levels aren’t very deep . overall, while it’s not as sharp as a true 300+ ppi flagship, in terms of colour and view angles, it’s a step up from a budget 5” hd display like you’d find on a zte grand x plus or a motorola moto e 2nd gen . camera: . there is a camera shutter button on the side of the phone . if you're thinking of lumia 830 or 635 i need to point out that the 635 lacks this feature . noise reduction and sharpening are like 2 sides of a coin; sharpening things too much emphasizes noise while removing too much noise can make images looks soft . i had a bit of trouble making up my mind about the 830’s image quality . it looks like the camera processing philosophy on the 830 is a bit different from the other phones on the market . most phones tend to favour heavier handed noise reduction - that’s why most look kind of splotch when you look up close . the 830 is different - instead of trying to get rid of as much noise as possible, it favours sharpening things up instead . this results in more visible noise . the 830 isn’t afraid to use slow shutter speeds - this can result in better, cleaner looking pictures but the problem is that it usually just result in blurry pictures because i just can’t hold the 830 still enough . it also means that the 830 is horrible for capturing anything with movement . of course, all of my observations are with the camera’s default settings . if you’re an expert user the 830 actually comes with 2 different camera applications . the default windows camera app and a nokia camera app . the nokia one has many more features but it takes a couple of seconds to launch . i don’t know about you but i use my camera to chase my kids around and those few seconds feel like forever . the thing is, when i take pictures i usually want it to happen as quickly as possible and the 830 just doesn’t do a good job when you use it like this . it’s too bad, lumias have sort of built a name for themselves with their camera chops but my experience is that they’re all way too slow for me to get any keepers . i guess the 830 is better if all your doing is taking pictures of food and other static subjects . software: . when you choose the lumia 830 over an android competitor, you also have to jump in with both feet and use windows phone . windows phone is a little different to use than android . while microsoft claims that the windows phone store has 100,000’s of apps, chances are you won’t find anything useful while the rest of the stuff hasn’t been updated in a few years . yeah, the most popular apps are there but if you want to do a bit of exploring you might get frustrated . otherwise, the lumia 830 is just like any windows phone but it has some nokia extras . what’s funny about that is that with the exception of some lesser known windows phones from the microsoft store, most windows phone sold here are from nokia . i won’t go too in depth into the extras but there are lot of them . lots of choice is good but when you turn the 830 on, you get the feeling that every single extra gets it’s own icon in the menu . lumia cinemagraph, lumia creative studio, lumia refocus, lumia selfie, lumia storyteller, do you really need a separate icon for each one? then there’s here drive+, here maps, here transit, is it really necessarily to split a mapping program into 3 . performance: . unless you’re comparing with other windows phones, there’s not much point comparing the performance of the 830 with other phones . i also don’t test a lot of windows phone so i’m the first to admit i don’t have a lot to compare against aside from an old lumia 920 i have lying around . there also aren’t a lot of cross-platform benchmarking programs available for it . there is antutu but it’s a very dated version and since scores seem to rise with each newer version, there’s no point comparing the 830 with anything else . with all that out of the way, i’d say the 830’s performance feels similar to that of an android with similar specs . while it seldom feels fast, it can usually handle whatever you throw at it so it’s adequate . the only time it feels slow is when you’re launching the nokia camera app and using it to take pictures . compared to the 920, even though the 830 only has half the ram, it does feel noticeably more spry so it’ll definitely feel like an upgrade . media capabilities: . i noticed a dolby logo on the 830 box but there’s no logo on the phone itself . the rear-facing speaker is pretty loud but it sounds horrible - maybe that’s why the dolby logo was left off the phone . aside from a tiny bit of hiss and the fact that its not as brutally loud as some recent phones, the headphone jack sounds fine . included is 16gb of storage, of which a surprising 14 . 5gb is available to use . if that’s not enough you can toss a microsd in . as a phone: . incoming sound quality is very good but there’s a tiny bit of hiss . the built-in speaker phone isn’t powerful plus it has a lot of hiss . rf performance is average . conclusion: . in the end, while i do like the $400 lumia 830’s screen and the metal frame, it doesn’t do much else to stand out in a sea full of android based competitors . really, the point of the lumia 830 is that it’s a nice phone for carriers to offer on a “lite” type of plan where the subsidy isn’t as high . the problem is that you can choose from phones like the nexus 5, or if you’re looking to purchase outright, something like a oneplus one . however, the biggest problem is that for less, you can purchase a zte grand x plus . when you think of phones, each manufacturer has carefully created a set of expectations that customers like us can look forward to in their devices . htc tries to make phones that are all metal with no gaps and an emphasis on the camera and multimedia experience . sony’s are all about their water resistant with glass and metal bodies and integration with their media services . that sort of thing . samsung is all about lots of features - they try to give you as much choice as possible . 2 years ago, when the industry trend was to move away from memory cards, samsung stood firm and had one of the only flagships that still included this useful feature . ditto for removable batteries . however, that was then and now, samsung seems set on redefining their brand . witness their newest flagship, the galaxy s6 which is quite a departure from previous galaxy s models . the removable battery and memory card slots are now a thing of the past as is the practical plastic body . those have been traded in for an elegant glass and metal body . edge or flat . this time around, there are 2 galaxy s6’s . one is the regular gs6, which we’ll call the flat in this section, and a variant called, the gs6 edge, which has a screen that curves into the edges . while phones with curved glass are nothing new, the edge’s screen actually bends over the sides . pictures don’t do it justice, it’s quite striking in person . otherwise, aside from the edge having a slightly larger battery, the gs6 and gs6 edge are more or less identical . if you want the edge, you’ll need to pay an extra $100 . the gs6 edge is really cool in person but if you’re a power user you’ll probably prefer the flat version . after getting over the curved sides, you may get tired/annoyed of having a screen that curves over the edges . don’t forget that that your palm is going to be touching the screen all the time with the edge . while it has decent palm rejection software, it doesn’t always work . yes, the edge comes with a little bit of extra functionality but if you ask me, the functionality falls in the gimmick category - the only reason why you should get the edge is because you think the curved sides are cool . do you want function over form (and save $100) or form over function . 32/64/128 . the s6 and s6 edge each come in 3 different storage configurations; 32, 64 and 128gb . kudos to samsung for making 32gb the lowest configuration . it’s much more generous and usable than the stingy 16gb you get with the most basic iphone 6 and 6 plus configurations . since the gs6 doesn’t come with a microsd slot, you can’t get out of buying a fancier configuration if you want more space down the road . it’s hard to put a price on extra storage . as i’m writing this in march 2015, a samsung or sandisk brand 128gb microsd goes for around $120 cdn while a 64gb is $50 . granted, built-in storage tends to be higher quality and faster but for most, once you go past a certain amount, you’re probably just using it to store stuff that doesn’t require huge amounts of speed . you do the math . still, 32gb is enough to hold 1000’s of photos, a bunch of videos and 100’s of apps . it should be enough for almost everyone . the 64 and 128gb configurations are probably more for users who want to actually store videos from their computer on the phone, those who want to use the gs6 has a very expensive flash drive or those who want to futureproof and think that coming versions of touchwiz will consume 30gb+ . the only way you can really get around that is to pick up an otg flash drive or maybe use a flash drive with an otg adapter . remember, 32gb gives you enough breathing room that you probably won’t have to rely on the drive constantly . what about the galaxy s5 . while each new galaxy s generation brings improvements, one thing that hasn’t really changed much is the price tag of around $650-$700 cdn . along with the edge variant, the s6 brings more than one storage configuration which approach and breach the psychological $1000 barrier . the worst thing about the galaxy s5 is that it only comes with 16gb of storage . sure, you can add microsd cards but out of the box, you’re almost at single digits of free space . considering that flagships are all about not making compromises, the stingy amount of storage is a pretty horrible compromise . the gs6 fixes this by coming with a minimum of 32gb of storage . however, if you’re coming from a gs5, you’ll need to make some compromises too . first off, as i’ve already mentioned, you lose the microsd slot which was previously one of samsung’s signature features . pretty much everyone from lg (the optimus g), to sony (xperia s), motorola (moto x) to htc (htc one m7) have all experimented with losing the microsd but until now, not samsung . while not everyone feels the need to pop in a microsd, it’s nice to have that option . secondly, another samsung signature feature; a removable battery is also mia from the gs6 . again, everyone else has already ditched it or experimented with it but until now, not samsung . the removable battery was a great feature if you kept your phone for a few years (battery life usually starts to shorten after 2 years) or if you plan on handing the phone to a family member or a friend after you’re done with it . to make matters worse, the gs6 doesn’t have any screws on the exterior so swapping out the battery will not be a trivial matter . the battery is almost 10% smaller than the gs6 so it’s probably going to see more cycles (wear out faster) than the gs5 one . you also lose the gs5’s water resistance . with the exception of sony, water resistance is not very common feature but losing this feature is losing something that gives users peace-of-mind . still, losing this feature also means that you won’t have to deal with the gs5’s annoying usb port cover . while the gs6 screen pixel count has almost doubled, it doesn’t really look any sharper than the gs5 . the only difference is that blocks of solid colour on the gs6 screen looks\ slightly cleaner because the graininess from the pentile arrangement are less noticeable . one thing that is improved is the colour which has been reigned in a little so it’s even more natural looking . however, the screen has gotten worse because it turns blue when you view it off-angle . all screens have some shifting when you view them off-angle but the gs6’s is very noticeable because it happens even at ‘normal’ viewing angles . one more minus with the gs6 is that it runs hot . i’m not sure if it’s the pre-production unit i’m using or what but it always get noticeably warm after i use it for a minute . this doesn’t happen with my other phones - even the lg optimus g takes a while . fortunately, everything else about the gs6 is an upgrade from the gs5 . both front and rear cameras are noticeable better, you get more ram, about 25% more performance, the speaker is more powerful and sounds better, but the best thing about the gs6 is its glass and metal body . from a tactile standpoint, it just takes the galaxy line to another level . what about the galaxy note 4/note edge . in a way, i think one reason why samsung backed off on the gs6’s battery size is to create more breathing room for the note series - they reached a point where adding larger screens would start to cause trade-offs with regards to portability . if you’re someone who likes how samsungs have always come with a removable battery and memory card, then you’ll want to stick with the note 4 and the edge . while their screens aren’t exactly the same, it’s hard to pick one over the other . the note 4 looks like it has purer whites, but i noticed it also has some banding in the yellow area of the screen mode page - it’s very minor so i’m not sure if you can really see it . both have a powerful built-in speaker but the gs6’s sounds much better . the cameras on both are quite similar . the gs6 has a newer, more powerful soc . both have fingerprint readers but the gs6’s is much easier to use . the gs6’s glass and metal body is scrumptious but the note 4’s metal frame is no slouch . you get samsung’s s-pen stylus with the note 4 . if you can handle the larger size, i’d say removable battery and memory card make the note 4 smarter choice - especially if you want to add storage down the road . what about the iphone 6/6 plus . not surprisingly, the first question you have to ask is: “do want coke or pepsi, i mean, do i want android or ios?” or if for many; “galaxy or iphone?” .  . if you plan on buying lots of accessories, then the iphone is unmatched in this regard . still, out of all the non-iphone devices out there, the gs6 will be the next best choice . then there’s the app question, both android and ios have lots of apps and both will probably have all the popular ones . some may disagree but i usually prefer the ios app store to google play when it comes to gaming . i also find that you can buy more ios games, in case you’re allergic to freemium type games or ads . of course, if don’t have a buck or two to spare and are allergic to paying for apps, than android is probably a better choice . after that, there’s the hacking and customization question . it’s generally easier to do deep customizations to android phones . the gs6 is probably going to be very popular so there will probably be many custom roms for it . with ios, you need to make sure you can jailbreak and if you want to stay jailbroken, you need to keep on top of the scene . once you get past all that, there’s also the user interface question . do you like android’s widgets, home screens and app drawers or do you like apple’s flatter interface?  . if you still don’t have a preference then it’s time to move on to the the gs6/gs6 edge vs iphone 6/6 plus question . looks matter and if you ask me, all 4 phones are lookers . if that’s the only thing that matters to you, you might find the gs6 edge’s curved screen interesting . in a way, it will make your phone unique but then again, samsung will probably sell millions of edges so you really won't’ be . out of all 4 phones, the gs6 has the sharpest screen though i think the 6 plus has the cleanest looking display . the gs6 and gs5 both have pentile displays and while you don’t really notice it normally, they’re slightly graining looking if you look at them closely . at 326ppi, the iphone 6 is still very sharp, but you can see it’s individual pixels clearly if you look closely . the samsungs have much deeper blacks which makes their colour pop . colour is a really personal thing - i’ll just say that all 4 are fairly natural looking so you can’t go wrong with any of them . all 4 phones lack a removable battery and storage . however, if you have to change the iphone’s batteries it’s important to point out that it’s relatively easy because there are screws on the bottom of the phones which makes opening them easier . the gs6 has no screws so it’s probably glued together and will probably be difficult to open . the gs6’s have 16 megapixel imagers which capture 16:9 ratio photos so they’re quite bit wider than the 6/6 plus . their sensors are noticeably less sensitive than the iphone’s so indoors, the iphone’s pictures tend to be cleaner looking . i prefer the iphone’s cameras and tend to get more keepers with them . that being said, i love how fast the gs6’s can launch their cameras . it’s only a fraction of a second faster than the iphone’s but when you have kids, those fractions of a second can make all the difference . out of the bunch, the iphone 6 is the only one without image stabilization . you’ll notice this when you’re shooting static objects or video . speaking of video, the iphones only record video with the center of their displays so things will look more ‘zoomed in’ . this way, they can use the extra pixels on the edges to help stabilize video further . the gs6 doesn’t do this as much so videos will be more ‘zoomed out’ . both approaches have their merit - there are times i wish the the iphones didn’t zoom in and there are times i wish the gs6 was a little tighter . the gs6 can also record 4k/uhd video while the iphones only record at full hd . then again, the iphones can record at 240 frames per second plus their sensors are sensitive enough to actually pull this off . one area where the gs6 clearly wins is the built-in speaker . it’s much louder than either iphone and sounds just as good as the 6 plus’ which in term makes it better than the 6 . despite the smaller battery, i’d say battery life on the 6 is similar to the gs6 . the 6 plus however, is on another level and should last quite a bit longer than the gs6 . i also noticed that the iphones run quite a bit cooler than the gs6 . it could just be my pre-production gs6 but i find it heats up very quickly . some may find it alarming and may not appreciate the sweaty palms it might cause in the summer . i do like how the gs6 base model comes with a generous 32gb of storage . the iphone’s base models come with a really stingy, heck i’d say irresponsible, 16gb of storage . it fills up really quickly . all in all, you can’t go wrong with either of them . both of them cost more than the competition but as usual, the apple tax is a higher than the samsung tax . body: . in past galaxy s reviews, this is the part where i tell you about how the cheesy plastics samsung used to make make their latest flagship do a decent job of not looking like plastic . my recent galaxy s reviews usually had a paragraph where i’d inadvertently become a samsung apologist for their decision to use plastic instead of metal . with that in mind, i’m happy to say that the first thing you’ll notice about the gs6 is its aluminum frame and the glass back . some metal phones like the note 4 and last year’s sony xperia z1 also had metal frames but they had hard edges which emphasize the fact that they’re not plastic but also make them uncomfortable to hold .  . the frame is unmistakably metal yet at the same time, it is sculpted such that it’s comfortable to hold . there’s a very small chamfered edge where the metal frame transitions to glass on the front to the back . the glass has a very gentle curve so that it appears to go underneath the frame . the execution is just fantastic . one thing i didn’t expect is that the gs6 runs pretty hot and that it heats up very quickly . it can go from normal to hot in less than a minute . is this because samsung underestimated how much heat a 64 bit, octa-core soc would put out? or is the metal frame just very efficient at cooling the processor . i did do a bit of stress testing and found that even though the gs6 can get worrisomely hot, i didn’t notice any throttling the speed of the soc due to heat . in my hand, the gs6 curved edges make it feel quite a bit smaller than the gs5 - more so than the dimensions say . if you opt for the gs6 edge, then the curved sides make it feel dramatically smaller . i love how the glass on the back has a slick satin effect when you look at it from an angle . it adds a bit of flare to the design without making it gaudy . samsung has ditched the removable back cover which allows it to be slightly thinner than the gs5 . its minimalist back cover (as opposed to the gs5’s overdesign cover) makes the camera bulge more noticeable pronounced . of course, since the back cover is now fixed that means the battery is not user removable . behind the back is support for both qi and pma charging standards . speaking of charging, if you opt for a regular usb charger, the gs6 supports charge rates of up to 14 . 67 watts . this is a bit faster than the competition which usually top out 10 to 12 watts . good riddance to the gs5’s cheap, mushy buttons . all of the gs6’s buttons have been upgraded so that they have a nice click when you press them . after using the gs6, you’ll swear that the gs5’s buttons are broken . the home button still doubles as a fingerprint reader but now all you have to do is place your finger on it to unlock . you don’t have to slide your finger anymore . it works well most of the time and is just as easy and intuitive to use as apple’s fingerprint reader . i like how it unlocks the gs6 faster than the reader on the iphone 6 does . i noticed that the home button protrudes out quite a bit . most people won’t encounter this problem but what happened to me was i was double carrying the gs6 in my pocket with an iphone 6 plus . since the home button sticks out, a lot of the time the screen would turn on because my iphone 6 kept pressing it in . by default, the gs6 has a fairly bright colour scheme and a super bright, power-sucking super amoled screen . this combination along with the constant button pressing had a devastating effect on the gs6’s battery life . while the build quality is top-notch, i couldn’t help but notice that like the htc one m7 and m8, the gs6 has no screws on the exterior . does this mean that the gs6’s is glued together and that the battery is virtually impossible to replace like the htc one’s or microsoft surface pro or is it just difficult . thanks to andrew for pointing out this link . turns out swapping the battery is somewhat of an ordeal: . heat front to soften glue . pry the sides loose . pull screen off with a suction cup . remove screws . remove buttons (i’m not joking) . remove wireless charging coil . remove motherboard (i’m serious) . then you can get to the battery . just in case you’re not aware, removing the gs5 battery goes something like this: . remove battery cover . remove battery . i’m just sayin’ . another thing to consider is that unlike the gs5, the gs6 isn’t dust and water resistant . you could argue that most users are careful enough that their gs5 has never even gotten wet but the water resistance is more about piece of mind . if your phone ever does have an accident and gets wet it has a higher chance of survival . i’m not shattered that the gs6 loses the water resistance but i am mildly disappointed . on the bright side, you also don’t have to deal with the gs5’s annoying usb port cover anymore .  . display: . the screen resolution has had a substantial bump from 1920x1080 to 2560x1440 . while the resolution on the gs6 is much higher, after spending a lot of time with the gs6 i can safely say that there’s no difference in sharpness unless you look really, really closely and are extremely nearsighted like me . text looks identical on both even when they’re so small that they’re barely legible like results page after you run the sunspider benchmark using chrome . here the text is so small i can’t read it unless i’m standing still and even then, there’s no difference is sharpness . it’s easy to get caught up in numbers the what gets lost is that the gs5 already has an extremely high ppi display . if ppi were cheeseburgers then the gs5 would have 5 patties while the gs6, 10 . no one’s gonna notice the extra meat . the difference is so small, i have to wonder whether it’s worth the graphics performance and battery life hit, having such a high resolution screen brings . in a way, ppi is analogous to megapixels or horsepower, it’s important to have enough as opposed to having as much as possible . don’t forget that the gs6 runs hot and has a smaller battery than the gs5 so the price to paid may be higher than we realize . initially, the gs6 display really reminded me of the gs5’s but after comparing them side-by-side, i can see some minor differences . while some amoled displays are criticized for being over-saturated, the gs5 wasn’t too bad in this regard . that said, samsung has reigned in the gs6 even more so that it’s even more natural looking and isn’t annoying to look at . the reds have been pulled in a little more and whites are cleaner looking . blacks are just as deep as ever . maximum brightness is about the same as the gs5 as is outdoor performance (it’s acceptable) . the only area where the screen is worse than the gs5 is that it turns blue at moderate angles like the note 4 does . it’s especially noticeable if you have a white background . i have talked to a few note 4 owners about this and they either don’t notice it or get used . to me, it’s dramatic and just shouldn’t happen on such an expensive device - especially since the gs5 doesn’t do this . i think the reason why i notice this so much is because i rarely look at my phones straight on . i don’t want to bend my neck too much while at the same time, i don’t want to hold my phone right in front of me . call me crazy but my phones are usually at a 15 or 20 degree angle from my line of sight . overall, the gs6 screen has more pleasing colour than the gs5 but it introduces noticeable off-angle colour shift so all in all, it’s just a mild upgrade - resolution isn’t the end all be all of screen performance . camera: . thankfully, samsung has resisted the temptation to increase the pixel count so the camera still only has 16 megapixels . more megapixels are great for marketing but as many consumers realize, packing extra pixels into the same space usually results in noisier pictures, reduced dynamic range and generally speaking, worse looking pictures . it now has optical image stabilization which is a boon if you take a lot of video or photograph a lot of still subjects in low light . the lens is also a little bit wider than the gs5 . the best thing about the camera isn’t the camera itself but the fact that you can now launch it by double pressing the home button . previously, double pressing the home button would launch s-voice which i don’t think anyone actually used so this is a much better use of this function .  . it gets better, most of the time the camera launches extremely fast - noticeably faster than the gs5 and the iphone 6 . this is awesome if you’re like me and use your camera mostly to chase your kids around . the optical image stabilization, slightly bigger (f/1 . 9 vs f/2 . 2) lens and wider angle lens means the gs6 doesn’t rely as heavily on it’s low light mode as much as the gs5 . since you can’t turn the ois off it’s hard to compare, but it looks like the gs6 sensor is also slightly more advanced . shadows are a bit cleaner with more detail: . the gs6 and gs5 look very similar here but if you look closely, the gs6 captures a lot more detail . look at the seat: . colour is nice and accurate - no complaints here . the gs6 is very well behaved in this regard . the gs6 has a special low light mode which does a lot of processing to bring details out . i suspect it also snaps multiple exposures . it’s a good compromise . if you take a lot of close-ups, the gs6 has an outstanding macro mode able to focus on an area approximate 68 x 36mm . to compare, the iphone 6 plus can only manage around 75 x 55mm . i tested these areas by hand so i might be off by a few mm and keep in mind that the gs6 captures a wider 16:9 aspect ratio so even though the horizontal measurement is only off by 7mm, vertically the difference is close to 20mm so it’s a big difference . at 5 megapixels, the front-facing camera has received a big bump in resolution from the gs5’s 2 . asides from the resolution, the new sensor and lens are a big improvement . it’s noticeably more sensitive and cleaner . that said, while the sensor can record 5 megapixels of information, the effective resolution (the actual detail captured) is no where near 5 . it barely captures more information than the iphone 6’s 1mp front-facing camera . a lot of this may be due to how the gs6 processes images from the front camera . since selfies are all the rage now, having a camera which reveals every blemish on your face isn’t . so, the gs6 will always try to smooth things out which results in weird looking images (and happy owners) . the angle of the lens is noticeably wider so you can capture more - if you need more it also has a panorama feature so that you can move it side-to-side to capture even more . this feature has one big caveat - while you can now fit more friends in your selfies, it also has a tendency to stretch things out on the sides if you hold it close . so, while the gs6’s front camera can capture more, it can sometimes also add 10lbs to your pictures . video quality is very good . don’t forget that there’s a 4k video mode which is capped at 5 mins per clip . the optical image stabilization is really useful if you shoot 4k since it disables the digital stabilization . i don’t have a way to test the effectiveness of ois but my feeling is that it’s more effective than the stabilizer on the iphone 6 plus though this probably just an effect of the gs6’s much wider angle when capturing video . the microphone is excellent . it sounds great and doesn’t pick up any handling noise . samsung has over-hauled the camera app on the gs6 . gone is the giant ‘chart’ of camera options . instead there’s now an auto mode and pro mode (along with selective focus, panorama, slow motion video, fast motion video and virtual shot) . here’s a list of functions: . auto: . flash . self timer . hdr . effect . pro has the same features as auto plus: . metering (center weighted, matrix, spot) . exposure (-2 to +2 in 0 . 1 increments) . iso (auto, 100 - 800) . white balance (auto, cloud, incandescent, fluorescent) . focus (macro to infinity) . colour modes . the selective focus only works if the subject you want to be in focus is fairly close . you can download other camera modes - this feature is also available for older samsung phones . overall, i’m happy with the camera app though i wish it would remember that i was using pro mode last rather than always starting up in auto mode . i also wish there was a way to disable the night mode . sometimes i don’t want my shadows to be dark . software: . out of the box, you get android 5 . 0 lollipop . it used to be that samsung’s touchwiz software gave them an advantage over the competition . back then android was really raw and lacked a lot of polish . however, that was 5 or 6 years ago and since then, android has slowly matured to the point that it doesn’t need heavy customization .  . in fact, for some people, touchwiz is now just a vestigial feature that serves little purpose . i have one very gripe that annoys me to no end . it used to be that one of my favorite touchwiz features was that you could scroll through when you were moving between pages of apps . back then, android wouldn’t do this . however, in the gs6, samsung has actually removed this feature . i like how stock android now lets you pull down once to see your notifications and twice to see your switches (or you can pull down with two fingers) . the gs6 still insists on showing your switches and keeping them at the top so they eat up about 25% of the screen space . then again, i love how the notification area disappears when you adjust the brightness . one new feature is that samsung has taken a lot of the icons in the user interface and either labelled them or replaced them completely with text .  . i like how you can press backspace on the keyboard to un-autocorrect what the phone thinks is a typo . sometimes i want to intentionally misspell a word without having to add it to the dictionary . there’s a lot of duplication of built-in programs because google and samsung are sort of fighting over which one they want you to use . you get 2 browsers, 2 picture galleries, 2 email apps, 2 music players, 2 video players, 2 app stores and 2 voice recognition programs . these days, samsung’s emphasis is less on trying to add little nicknacks to android - remember air view or whatever-the-heck samsung called it? neither do it . now their they spend a lot more time talking about how well their phones play with business . i’m no expert in this regard so i’ll just leave it at that . samsung is also has a payment system for the gs6 . while it’s compatible with nfc payment systems like the competition, you can also use it on magnetic swipers . i’m not sure how much of this functionality is coming to north america . overall, while it’s not perfect, touchwiz doesn’t feel as top heavy as it used to be . indeed, with 25 . 4gb of free space, the gs6 isn’t too bad an offender . here’s a random sample of how much space you get with some other 32gb phones i have lying around: . note 4 (kitkat) 24 . 2gb . note 3 (kitkat) 24 . 2gb . lg g2 (kitkat) 24 . 1gb . lg g3 (lollipop) 24 . 7gb . galaxy s6 (lollipop) 25 . 4gb . nexus 6 (lollipop) 25 . 9gb . performance: . starting with the galaxy s3, north american galaxy s’ all used qualcomm soc’s so many people were a little surprised that the gs6 didn’t use qualcomm’s snapdragon 810 soc . the rumor is that the snapdragon 810 had some heat issue so samsung opted for their own soc instead . if the rumor is true, then part of the fault may lie with the gs6’s design . even with their own soc, the gs6 can get pretty hot . according to my infrared thermometer, the back can reach 120f . while that’s not hot enough to burn, it can be alarming . i guess the gs6 would have been handy this past winter . the gs6 does really well in the peacekeeper, besting all android phones i’ve tested by a comfortable margin and approaching the iphone 6 . it also does well in graphics benchmarks, it’s able to edge out the note 4 by quite a bit . and here’s the antutu score if you just want to compare a single meaningless number . now if you know me, you’ll know that i hate benchmarks because they don’t really tell us anything useful . the way i see it, i want a fast device so that i don’t have to wait as much . for me, i want a phone to launch my camera as fast as possible and in the case of the gs6, it’s able to launch the camera super fast . i’m talking noticeably faster than an iphone 6 and it’s predecessor, the gs5 . multimedia: . previous samsung phones like the gs5 and note 4’s have powerful built-in speakers that don’t sound very good . the gs6 has a single, really powerful speaker that may be the loudest i have ever tested . sound quality is an improvement too though it overdrives the treble a little - in that sense the moto x and htc one m8 sound a little better . i guess that’s usually the compromise, do you want extra volume or do you want to trade it for better sound quality . the headphone amp is pretty awesome . by default it sounds incredible . bass is strong without sounding bloated with clear highs . i don’t have a htc one m8 around to compare but the gs5 amp may be even more powerful . it’s so ear-burstingly loud that it can overdrive many headphones easily so take it easy with the volume . there’s a “sound alive” feature which allows you to destroy sound quality by adjusting an equalizer or by adding horrible effects like 3d or a tube amp feature . sound alive is off by default for a reason . one great thing about galaxy s’ is that they always came with a microsd card slot . even when the industry trend was to ditch the microsd card samsung still stuck with this awesome feature . unfortunately, the galaxy s6 breaks this tradition by ditching the microsd . you have to decide, ahead of time, how much storage you need and be prepared, it’s going to cost you . still, the base gs6 comes with 32gb of storage which is by no means, skimpy . it does mean though that a) you can’t expand the storage after the fact and b) you won’t be able to use your existing memory card unless you get an inconvenient otg reader . you do get faster built-in storage on the gs6 but that’s more to benefit performance (programs load faster) rather than multimedia which doesn’t typically require insanely fast speeds . if you like copy a lot of multimedia to and from the gs6, you’re probably disappointed that the gs6 downgrades the gs5’s usb 3 . 0 connector to a 2 . 0 one . don’t worry though, while not slow, the gs5’s 3 . 0 port was no faster than a good 2 . 0 port - that includes the gs6’s 2 . 0 port . so while the physical connector is a downgrade, you don’t lose any performance at all . as a phone: . incoming sound quality is very clean . the noise reduction on the gs6’s incoming is very effective . the earpiece is one of the loudest on the market . ditto for the speakerphone . both also have a volume boost feature which is very useful if you’re in a noisy environment . rf performance is excellent . previously, each new galaxy s would bring a larger removable battery . the original had a 1500mah battery, next came a 1650mah in the ii, and then 2100mah, 2600mah while the 5 got a fairly large 2800mah battery . so, it’s very puzzling that the gs6/gs6 edge bucks this trend . the 6 comes with a fixed 2550mah (smaller than even the gs4!) while the 6 edge’s fixed battery only matches the gs4’s 2600mah . don’t forget that while the gs6 has many power saving features, it has a larger, and brighter screen . while the gs6 will last most users the day, people who were hoping that the gs6 would come with a battery that seems to last forever, like the oneplus one, will be disappointed . i’ve seen gs6 advertising talking about how quickly it charges but to be honest, it almost feels like an apology for downsizing the battery . i already mentioned this earlier, but it’s worth repeating . the gs6’s battery is smaller and not removable - that means the battery is going to see more charging cycles than a larger one . so, what happens when the gs6’s battery wears out and needs replacing? the gs6 doesn’t have any visible screws on the outside (or in the sim card holder slot) so i’m guessing that opening it is going to be quite an ordeal . like the note edge, the gs6 and gs6 edge both support the carrier aggregation (ca) and rogers and bell (telus doesn’t have this feature at this time) are using . ca allows you to combine the resources of 2 lte bands . on rogers, you can combine their band 4 (up to 75mbps download) and band 7 (up to 150mbps) for speeds of up to 225mbps . while you could point out that no one really needs such high speeds, i’m guessing that marketing aside, ca could be useful if you’re experiencing low speeds on both lte bands . indeed that’s the case in my subterranean lair, i mean basement office where i have almost no signal . i did notice one problem with ca . right now, ca only works on the downlink (it doesn’t combine upload speeds) and indeed, it appears that that the gs6 won’t support ca on the uplink even if rogers and bell add that to their networks . the problem is that on rogers, the uplink on their band 7 is quite a bit faster than on band 4 . however, when ca is active, it only uses the uplink on band 4 . so, if you’re uploading something large (like a bunch of photos or videos), you’ll actually get slower speeds with ca . is it carrier aggregation or carrier aggravation . it costs how much . another big change is the price, the top spec gs6 edge commands a 50% price premium over the gs5 . it used to be that flagships had a ceiling of around $700 can before subsidy . there are 3 reasons why the gs6 costs dramatically more than the gs5 . first off, the gs6 is just packed with cutting edge hardware; a 64bit octa-core processor, stabilized lens, ddr4 ram, at least 32gb of storage, etc . don’t forget that you now get a slick metal and glass body . sure, it’s no longer water resistant but my guess is that the gs6 costs a little more to make than a gs5 did when it first came out . secondly, after several years of being around par, the us dollar has appreciated dramatically in a short period of time . after hovering around par for a few years, the canadian dollar is now worth 25% less . last year, it was perfectly acceptable to price a $700 usd phone at $700 can even though after conversion, it $700 usd is actually $735 cdn . now, a $700 usd phone is worth $875 cdn so something has got to give . don’t forget, many of a phone’s components are priced in usd . generally speaking, whether you love or hate apple, their products usually indicate the maximum a company can charge for that type of product . there aren’t a lot of android tablets that cost more than an ipad, there aren’t many pc notebooks which cost more than a macbook pro, that sort of thing . so, when apple raised prices for the latest generation of iphones it gave other companies breathing room to raise their prices too . do you want to get sued . you know what’s funny? when samsung introduced the original galaxy s, it was criticized by many for being a copy of the iphone . since then samsung has refined their galaxy s line and given it its own identity . however, the galaxy s6, moves back in the direction of the iphone and embraces some of the iphone’s strengths (metal body) and weaknesses (built-in battery, no memory card, different storage points, higher price) . heck, the other day i woke up and was confused for a split second when i saw the bottom of the gs6 - it really reminds me of an iphone 6 with the speaker holes of a 5s . conclusion: . no doubt about it, the most important upgrade that the gs6 brings to the table is its wonderful glass and metal body . however, the price to pay for the new body is high; the gs6 lacks the removable battery and storage that the galaxy s line was previously known for plus it loses it’s predecessor’s water resistance along with the piece of mind that it brings . since it no longer has removable storage, you have to figure out how much space you need ahead of time and you have to pay an apple-like tax to get it . however, the gs6 brings some other improvements including a powerful speaker that finally sounds good . the processor is quite a bit more powerful though some of that is wasted on driving the much higher resolution screen which doesn’t look any sharper . 3gb of ram is an incremental upgrade - i doubt most users will notice it over 2gb but it does add some piece of mind from a future-proofing perspective . having support for both wireless charging standards is another nice extra but you still have to go out and pick up a wireless charger if you want to use this . then again, telus and rogers are giving away wireless chargers if you pre-order and upgrade to one of their newer over-priced plans . in the end, the gs6 is a great phone and a worthy upgrade to the gs5 . just be aware that it also forces you to make some compromises . when motorola released the original moto g, it really turned the industry on its side . before it came out, all the brand name phones at its price point where not very good . the moto g was really one of the first affordable phones that didn’t make any serious compromises . motorola followed it up with the original moto e . with an even more budget friendly price tag, many hoped it would bring the cost of getting a decent phone down even more . however, when it launched it was clear it had some serious compromises . the 4 . 3” screen was too small and cramped, it came with very little storage (4gb) and while it had plenty of megapixels, the camera was terrible . now motorola has a new moto e that addresses most of the original’s shortcomings plus it comes with an unexpected extra - lte support . let’s check it out: . pricing: . the new moto e with lte launches in canada later this month for $150 locked on telus and koodo . it’s also available in the us unlocked for $120 for the hspa version and $150 for the lte . boost and sprint have a locked version for $100 . no carriers here picked up the original moto e here but here in canada it was $179 unlocked or around $120 unlocked in the us . what about the first gen moto g . just to clean the air, i’m comparing the moto e 2nd gen with the original moto g variant which supports hspa with 8gb of built-in storage and no memory card slot . they can be picked up for as low as $120 on prepaid, while in the us, they can go for under $100 . both have 4 . 5” displays . the moto g rocks a 1280 x 720 screen with a ppi of 329 . the e2 has to make do with just 960 x 540 (40% less pixels) and 245ppi . to me eyes, there’s a noticeable difference between 329 and 245ppi . don’t forget that the 4 . 5” display is a bit small and most people will tend to hold it a little closer so the sharpness or lack there of is easier to see . both also use on-screen menu buttons so the usable screen area is a little bit smaller than 4 . 5” . the moto e2 hides this weakness by making text a bigger than it is on the moto g by default . you also get a little less off-angle colour and contrast shift with the moto g . there’s a 1 . 2ghz snapdragon 400 soc in the moto g while the e2 gets a newer, 64bit 1 . 2ghz snapdragon 410 . as it turns out, clock-for-clock, the 410 offers around 20% more browsing performance . i’m not sure if part of this difference is because the moto g i’m comparing it with is running android 4 . 4 . 4 while the moto e2 has android 5 . 0 . in case you’re wondering, the only moto g i have lying around is an xt1040 variant with lte which is standing in for the original g . as of right now lollipop isn’t available for it yet . however, the adreno 306 in the e2 is actually slower than the 305 in the moto g . the e’s lower resolution display sort of balances things out . when you boil things down, the moto g has the screen advantage while the e2 gets points for having a microsd slot, lte, a faster soc, a bigger battery, a better sounding and a front-facing speaker . you’d think the e2 takes it but guess what, when you use your phone you’re usually staring at the screen so choosing between the 2 is very difficult . what about the zte grand x plus . to me, i reckon the e2’s biggest competitor right now in canada isn’t the moto g1 but actually the zte grand x plus on fido . unless you’re budget is so strict that you can’t spend a penny more than $150, you should really consider forking out another $50 and getting a gxp . the only areas where the e2 beats the gxp are that it has better battery life and a slightly faster processor . the gxp biggest win is that it comes with a 5” 1280x720 display which really makes it a much nicer phone to use . digging deeper, the 2gb of ram vs 1gb makes the gxp a better multi-tasker plus its camera is better . what about the moto e1 . unless you’re getting an obscenely good deal on the first gen moto e, there’s no reason to get one over an e2 . the 4 . 3” screen is too small, it doesn’t come with enough built-in storage and the camera is awful . what about the moto g second generation . the moto g2 is a really nice phone but in canada it’s currently $250 unlocked which is considerably more than the e2 . what about the rest . other competitors include the htc desire 510 and nokia lumia 635 . the lumia 635 is especially tempting since they go on sale for $99 unlocked . if money is tight you should look at that . otherwise, while the desire and nokia are not bad phones, they come with lower resolution 854 x 480 displays which aren’t as sharp as the e2’s . remember, when we use our smartphones most of the time is spent staring at the screen . body: . in my hand, the e2 is a little thicker than i’m used to but it does make it feel substantial . the back is covered with a soft-touch finish that really attract a lot of dust .  . the edges of the back can be removed and swapped with different coloured edges . i like how they’re ribbed, it makes it a pleasure to grip . my e2 came with black, red and blue edges . removing the edges reveals the microsd and microsim slots along the right side . is that an extra microsim slot behind the cover . the slot on the other side holds documentation for the e2 since there’s no where else to put a sticker with the serial number . you get a 5 megapixel camera and a microphone on the back but no flash . while the back edges are removable, the back itself isn’t . this makes the e2 feel much more solid though you can’t easily swap out the battery . then again, the moto g, e, x and nexus 6 all have built-in batteries too . notice the divot where the motorola logo is . motorola says you can rest your finger there but i find i end up putting my finger over the camera instead . go figure . the long silver speaker in front resembles the moto g 2nd gen (and moto x/nexus 6) though the e2 only has one of them . there's a microusb slot at the bottom . nothing to see on the left . the volume and power buttons on the right have an excellent feel to them . headphone jack on top . display: . you get a 4 . 5” 960x540 ips display . at 245 ppi it’s not tack sharp - you’ll definitely notice some jaggedness from time to time . that said, it’s usually good enough to get the job done . as you move off-angle, the display goes dark at around 30 degrees off-angle . it’s quite annoying . otherwise, it’s an adequate display . it’s not super bright but it should be bright enough to use outdoors . colour is pleasant . my problem with the display is that it’s only 4 . 5” . these days, android needs at least 5” . since the e2 tries to cover up the lower ppi by making text larger, it really makes the screen feel cramped . i think this is the e2’s biggest weakness as a lot of the competition are now packing 5” and it really makes a big difference . camera: . while the resolution is unchanged, the rear-facing camera is a huge improvement over the first gen e . if i were to describe the first gen e’s camera in one word it would start with the letter “s” and rhyme with “hit” . the original e camera was so horrible it was basically unusable . the fact that it didn’t have autofocus was the least of its problems . the e2’s camera has autofocus and it works fairly quickly and has very good shot-to-shot speeds . it’s a little on the noisy side and sometimes could use a little more dynamic range (blows out sometimes) but all-in-all, you’ll get the occasional keeper from it so it’s a huge step up . it can capture hd video but watch out, while the microphone sounds fine, it picks up a lot of handling noise . software: . the e2 i’m reviewing has android 5 . 0 . 2 lollipop - this is great since most competitors are still on 4 . 4 . based on previous experience, i’d expect motorola to release updates soon after new versions of android drop . motorola doesn’t mess around with android so the e2 is mostly stock android . motorola just includes a few extra applications; moto alert, an fm radio, moto migrate and moto . moto is automation software . it will periodically show you notifications even if your phone is locked and the screen is off . i’m not sure how useful this is since my phone is usually in my pocket when i’m not using it plus it tends to light the screen up at night . the screen is mostly black when it does this but since the e2 has a lcd display it still creates a lot of light . it can launch the camera automatically if you hold the e2 and make a twisting motion like you were turning a door knob . this works even when the screen is off . you can also tell moto to keep your screen turned off at night when you’re sleeping (a must because of the notifications) . if you’re in a meeting you can have it automatically send replies to numbers whose calls you’ve ignored . one of my favorite lollipop features; the notification area flashlight shortcut, is missing from the e2 because it doesn’t have a flash to double as a flashlight . performance: . this is first phone that has come across my desk that is rocking qualcomm’s new snapdragon 410 soc . if you’re keeping track, it’s a chip that’s powered by arm’s new 64bit cortex a53 core . most of qualcomm’s older snapdragon 400 soc’s were powered by arm’s older 32bit cortex a7 . you’re probably wondering if the new core brings any additional performance or if it’s unchanged . as they say; the bottle has change but is the wine any different . turns out, clock-for-clock . the 410 brings around 25% faster browsing performance than the 400 which is a nice improvement: . however, the 410’s gpu, the adreno 306 is actually slightly slower than the adreno 305 found in the 400 . still, since the e2 only has a 960x540 display, so in tests that run at the e2’s native resolution it’s still more than up to the task . media capabilities: . compared to the moto g, the second e2’s speaker sounds like it has been tuned more . as such; while it sounds better, it’s not quite as loud . the fact that it’s now front-facing is a welcome improvement over the original e . the headphone jack is extremely powerful with good sound quality . seems almost every phone i try these days has an excellent headphone amp . you get 8gb of storage which is much more useful than the original’s 4gb . if you have a lot of media you can add a microsd card . as a phone: . battery life is excellent; let me put it in perspective for you, the e2 has a 4 . 5” display and a 2390mah battery . the just announced samsung galaxy s6 is endowed with 5 . 1” and a 2550mah battery . so, the s6’s display is nearly 30% larger but the battery is less than 7% bigger . don’t forget that the s6 has a super bright, power sucking amoled display while the e2 has a more pedestrian display that has average brightness . with a battery that’s large for its screen size the e has excellent battery life . pretty much every one will make it through the day . less demanding users may even see a second . rf performance is very good . maximum earpiece volume is average . the speakerphone isn’t very powerful plus it has this annoying tendency to take a second or 2 to actually activate when turn it on . when i turn the speakerphone i usually end up turning it off right away because the lag makes me think it didn’t get turned on . sound quality is nice and smooth . you also get support for lte . you’d think a budget phone like the e would get very basic lte support but according to the motorola webpage it supports bands 2, 4, 5, 7, 12 and 17 . that’s pretty comprehensive and remember, 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17 are all used here in north america . it includes lte cat 4 support so you can get speeds of up to 150mbps (up to 112 . 5mbps on telus) . conclusion: . when motorola released the original e last year it was their attempt to make an affordable phone for the lowest possible price . however, their cost cutting resulted in a phone that wasn’t up to snuff . for the price, the new moto e is tough to beat . the fact you get lte with a snapdragon 410 soc, 1gb ram and 8gb of storage in a phone for only $150 makes it a positive steal . more importantly, it fixes a lot of the original e’s show-stopping weaknesses . it’s only real weakness is that it comes with a smallish 4 . 5” screen . i guess people who find 5” phones too big will disagree but these days, android phones with screens smaller than 5” just feel really cramped . if you’re in canada and thinking about picking up the moto e2 there is another problem - for only 50 bucks more you can swing a zte grand x plus . pretty much everything on the zte is a big step up from the e: you get 2gb ram (double the e’s 1gb and the same amount as many 2014 flagships), a decent 8 megapixel that has a flash and most importantly, a 5” high definition display . either way, one thing’s for sure, you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get a great phone . to android users, the nexus brand stands front and center . it stands for freedom from manufacturer crapware . unlike other android phones, nexus are usually unlocked plus their boot loaders are easily unlocked so you can easily throw on a custom rom . they also receive android updates the moment google releases them, and not 6 months later if ever like other android phones . most importantly, a nexus phone meant you were getting a great phone at a great price . here's the latest nexus from google which this time around, is made by motorola: the nexus 6 . like previous nexus (nexuses? nexii?), the 6 lacks manufacturer crapware, it has an easily unlocked boot loader and it receives timely updates . however, the nexus 6 is $750 which makes it the most expensive nexus ever . however, it’s also the most speced out nexus ever . is it still a great deal . pricing: . the nexus 6 comes in black (with a blue back) or white . each colour is available with 32 or 64gb of storage . don’t forget, you get 6 months of unlimited music from google play if you order a nexus 6 from google before december 31st . in canada, the 32gb is available direct from google play for $749 . as of 12/15, the nexus 6 ships in “3-4 weeks” . the 64gb is not yet available but will be $799 when it is . google play in the us has it for $649 . 99/699 . 99 for the 32/64gb versions . rogers has the nexus 6 32gb for $299 . 99 on contract or $749 . 99 off . bell has it for $279 . 95/749 . 95 while telus has it for $280/780 . in the us, at&t has the 32gb for $682 . 99 off contract, $22 . 77 x 30 months or $249 . 99 on contract . note that the at&t nexus 6 is carrier locked . sprint has if for $249 . 99 on contract, $27 x 24 months, $249 . 99 on contract or $648 off contract . what about the samsung galaxy note 4 . i’ll be honest, discussing the pros and cons of the nexus 6 vs the note 4 is pointless . the nexus 6 has one fatal flaw which makes it so i can’t recommend it to anyone . the nexus at maximum brightness is similar to the note 4 or iphone 6 plus when their brightness sliders are only at 50% . here’s what funny, if the nexus 6 was priced similarly to the nexus 5 (around $400 unlocked), i would absolutely say you can overlook the brightness . but since the 6 has a no-compromises $700+ can price tag, it’s a disgrace . it’s about as bright as a samsung galaxy s iii or a note ii . while i still think they’re nice phones, they’re also 2 generations old and substantially cheaper . if you can look past the brightness (and i don’t suggest you do), the nexus 6 compares well with the note 4 . the 6’s screen doesn’t turn blue like the note 4 does off angle . indoors, the 6 display is actually quite nice . performance on both is similar as is the battery life . while the 6 has a larger display, it’s not as bright . this is good for battery life . while the nexus 6 will receive updates faster and more frequently than the note 4, it remains to be seen what version of android each device will be on when they stop receiving updates . the note 4 does have a few extras like a microsd and removable battery . don’t forget the s-pen stylus, finger print reader along with the heart-rate and uv monitors . if you find those features useful, then they’re a big plus . with the exception of the at&t version, the nexus is sold by most places unlocked with no carrier or manufacturer crapware plus its speakers have much higher sound quality . even though the 6’s speakers sound better, they’re not as loud if you’re using them to make a speakerphone call . both have optical image stabilization . i’d say the note 4’s camera is a bit better but the nexus’ isn’t too bad . both also have fast charging . between the 2, i’d pick the note 4 mostly because it’s a more balanced device . also from a branding perspective, i’d be hesitant to drop so much money on a nexus device . what about the oneplus one . you’re probably wondering why i’m comparing the nexus 6 with with the oneplus one when it only costs half as much . after all, the opo has a smaller, lower resolution display, an older processor, no image stabilization and inferior speakers . while the opo screen is smaller than the nexus 6, it’s brighter and thus more usable . even though the resolution is lower than the 6, most people aren’t going to notice the difference because the pixel density on the opo is so high that the 6’s extra pixels don’t make it appear any sharper because of diminishing returns . as for the older processor, the nexus’ extra performance is wasted on the extra resolution which isn’t really noticeable so both have similar performance . one area where the opo pulls ahead is in the battery department . while the opo’s display is 20% smaller, it actually comes with a larger battery . in fact, the opo has stunning performance with many users getting 2 days of heavy usage out of it whereas the nexus battery will make it through a long day but nothing more . like the nexus, the opo takes custom roms just fine, it comes with no carrier crapware, is unlocked and receives updates quickly . the thing is, since the nexus 6 costs twice as much as the opo, the opo has actually become a spiritual successor of sorts to the nexus 5 . if a nexus device used to stand for a great deal, then the oneplus one out nexuses the nexus 6 in this regard . i’ll be honest, there’s no reason to buy a nexus 6 unless you want the awesome front-facing speakers or you can’t get your hands on a oneplus one . what about the google nexus 5 . if you already have a nexus 5 and are thinking about upgrading to a nexus 6 should you? i’ll be honest, the question you should actually be asking yourself is if you should upgrade to a oneplus one . in one word; “yes” . aside from the fact that the screen works better in direct sunlight and the smaller screen makes the nexus 5 easier to handle, everything about the nexus 6 is an upgrade . it’s available with more storage, the camera is an upgrade, the speakers sound better, the screen looks nicer . but the thing is, the nexus brand has become synonymous with a good deal for a solid phone . while the nexus 6 is unquestionably a solid phone, it’s also unquestionable not a good deal . if you want a good deal on a solid phone get the oneplus one . body: . if you’ve used or seen the second gen moto x then the nexus 6 doesn’t hold any surprises . it feels exactly like the x only it’s bigger . you get the same front with symmetrical forward facing speakers while the back has the same curves in 3 dimensions complete with slightly mismatched corner gaps . the back is metal and very solid . i’d say it’s more solid than the htc one . my nexus 6 is the black version which actually has blue painted back . the back really shows oil from your fingers and is difficult to clean . i think it makes the back look cheap . overall though, it’s a very nice looking design, the corners are a bit too hard so the 6 isn’t very comfortable to hold for long periods of time . then again, the fact that the 6 is a two handed phone mitigates this a little since you don’t need to grip it as tightly . when you have it next to the moto x, besides the nexus logo on the back, there aren’t a whole lot of differences . the grills over the speakers are smooth unlike the x’s which are machined . i also noticed that the microusb port on the 6 is upside-down like the nexus 5 and some htc phones . the bezel at the bottom of the screen is very narrow so i was curious if they would make the 6 harder to use because i find that the palm of my hand sometimes accidentally touches the corner of the screen . while my palm does touch the bottom of the screen, the 6 is set up so that you have to tap the picture on the on-screen buttons to activate them . just pressing the bottom right corner isn’t enough . it goes without saying that the nexus 6 with its 6” display is a huge phone . i already mentioned that the 6 is a 2-handed device . still, it has decent ergonomics so as long as you don’t have to reach across the screen you can sometimes get away with using it with one hand . if you want to carry the 6 in your pocket be aware that it’s fairly tall, so it might stick out if you put it in the back pocket of your jeans or in a coat breast pocket . when i wear jeans it jabs into my hips when i sit down . nothing to see on the left side . power, volume buttons . headphone jack, nano sim slot . microusb . display: . in front is a 6” 2560x1440 amoled display . at first i thought it had nice colour because the stock lollipop ui looked pretty natural . however, when i’m looking at pictures anything bright looks un-natural because it’s oversaturated . it’s a really annoying display to look at . while it has deep inky blacks like most amoled displays, the whites are a bit too restrained . the reason is because the screen isn’t as bright as some other amoled equipped phones like the note 4 or even it’s relative, the moto x . next to my iphone 6 plus, the nexus 6 at max brightness is similar to the note 4 or iphone 6 plus when their brightness sliders are at 50% . i tried to capture this with my camera but it didn't really turn out . i don’t have a tool to measure screen brightness but when i compare the nexus with some phones i have lying around, i’d say the maximum brightness is similar to a samsung galaxy s iii or a galaxy note . just to be clear, the nexus 6 is bright enough to look fine indoors - you don’t normally need a super bright display when you’re inside . however, maximum screen brightness is especially important with amoled displays because from my experience, they’re more susceptible to washing out when you’re outdoors . the latest generation of superamoled displays from samsung are insanely bright and while they’re not outstanding in the direct sunlight, they’re definitely usable . i couldn’t figure out how to capture this with a camera but the nexus struggles outdoors . it’s worse than the note 4 and the older nexus 5 in this regard . maybe motorola had to turn down the maximum brightness since the 6 only comes with a 3220mah battery which is a bit small for a 6” display . off-angle, the nexus doesn’t turn blue when you move slightly off center like the note 4 does . when it comes to phones, especially flagships, the display is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle and unfortunately for the nexus 6, its display comes up short . camera: . the 13 megapixel rear-facing camera has optical image stabilization . colour is reasonably accurate and google has resisted the temptation to oversaturate colours . just to clarify, while pictures viewed on the display are oversaturated, when you stick them on your computer or another device they have fantastic colour . like the moto x, the 6 has a ring flash . if you missed my moto x review, i talked about how ring flashes are used to create rings in the eyes of your subject plus they help with close-up (macro) photography since they help to light subjects more evenly . the problem with the 6’s ring flash is that the led’s are too small and bright . if you’re trying to make rings in someone eyes it won’t work because all you’ll see are 2 bright led’s . as for macros, since the led’s are so bright all they do is blast out your subject . while the ring flash is a cool feature, practically speaking it’s just a gimmick . a dual led, colour adjusting flash would be more useful . in terms of sensitivity, it’s maybe a generation or 2 behind market leaders like the apple iphone 6 plus . that said, if a picture turns out too dark, the 6’s photos handle brightening very well .  . shot-to-shot and focusing times are a tad slow for a flagship . the stabilized lens really makes a difference . when i hold the 6, sit down and bounce my leg, i can really see how much more stable the video is compared to when i try this with the moto x which is a similar phone that doesn’t have optical image stabilization . i managed to shoot close to 14 minutes of 4k video before the 6 overheated and tossed in the towel . that’s 4 more minutes than the x . the metal body really helps to cool the processor because it really heats up very evenly . the microphone sounds fine . it doesn’t pick up too much handling noise . my only complaint is that i’d like to have it bias a little more to the subject . software: . like all nexus devices, the 6 is one of the first devices to run the latest version of android 5 . 0 aka lollipop . the biggest change is that lollipop gets a completely new flat look . it takes some getting used to but personally, i don’t mind it and i’m an old fart that normally doesn’t like change . on one hand, until lollipop, the android ui hadn’t been overhauled since android 3 . 0, on the other hand, google has been honing the ui since 3 . 0 to the point that many android oem’s just use it instead of their own custom ones . i will say that i don’t really like the new menu icons . not because they’re ugly but because it feels like they ripped off a sony playstation controller . it’s important to look original . rather than give you a list of everything that’s changed, i’ll just mention what i’ve noticed . the default android keyboard now has a new look . there are no lines between the keys in keeping with the flat look . i’m not sure i really like it personally . even though there is less ‘stuff’ on the keyboard, at times i felt lost without the dividers between each key . when you pull the notification area down, you can now pull down a second time to reveal the phone’s switches . if you’re used to pulling down with 2 fingers to get to the switches, you can still do that too . one new switch which i don’t remember seeing before is that there is now a flashlight feature (finally) . unlike the old android holographic interface (3 . 0 and up) which is very dark, lollipop is pretty bright with a lots of white . i think it’s much friendlier looking . you know those cards that google now uses to organize information? now those cards are available in the notification area and lock screen . you can tap the cards to open the app or you can press the corner to configure when they notify you . when you switch tasks, the different apps you have running show up as cards along with chrome’s browser tabs . the built-in easter egg when you view “about phone” in the settings is now a flappy bird clone which is much harder than flappy bird . i had to look this up but under the hood, lollipop uses a new runtime called android runtime (art) instead of dalvik . dalvik is a just-in-time compiler which sort of puts programs together just as you’re about to run them . art puts the programs together when they’re installed so that they run faster . performance: . under the hood is a 2 . 7ghz quad-core qualcomm snapdragon 805 processor . performance is comparable to a 1080p, snapdragon 801 android flagship . while the 805 is a more powerful soc, it’s graphics processor isn’t powerful enough to offset the extra pixels in the display . as a result, gaming performance suffers a little bit . here's the antutu score: . practically speaking, the nexus 6 is very fluid and smooth . programs load quickly . the greatest comment is that you don’t normally think about how fast or slow the 6 is when you use it because it has sufficient performance . that said, when i put the nexus 6 next to my nexus 5, i found that the 5 was usually a hair faster . one of my favorite tests is to see how quickly a phone can launch the camera since i take a lot of pictures . the nexus 5 launches the camera faster, has faster shot-to-shot speeds plus it launches the browser and brings up the settings menu faster . media capabilities: . the front-facing stereo speakers rock . they’re just as loud as the note 4’s but you get 2 of them . in terms of sound quality, the note 4 sounds like an am radio next to the 6 because the 6 has much more range plus it just plain sounds better . like every other flagship i’ve tried recently the nexus 6 headphone jack is powerful and sounds great . while the 6 doesn’t come with a micro sd slot, you can spec it with either 32gb or 64gb of storage either of which should be enough for most users . as a phone: . incoming sound quality is a bit disappointing . everyone sounds like they have a cold . this is probably the result of over-aggressive noise reduction . maximum earpiece volume is a little on the quiet side . i’m not sure if this is due to the large front area preventing me from placing the earpiece closer to my ear . the built-in speakerphone volume is average . i noticed that when you activate the speakerphone it actually takes a second or 2 before it starts working . i’m not sure if this is a bug or by design but it’s really annoying . i made a call on the nexus 6 and moto x and compared their rf performance in hspa mode on bell . i actually found that the x has superior rf performance . the nexus 6 supports a staggering number of lte bands plus it supports lte carrier aggregation . here’s a partial list of support bands: . in addition to all these bands, the nexus 6 supports carrier aggregation . carrier aggregation allows a phone to use 2 different lte bands at the same time to increase speed . rogers is currently aggregating bands 2 and 17 with their lte advanced rollout . while i’m not sure of how extensive their band 17 rollout is and i have questions of how dense the coverage is, i have been pretty impressed with how large the coverage has grown in a short time . the non-removable battery has a capacity of 3220mah . while 3220mah sounds big, the 6 also has a big power sucking amoled display and a very bright ui . while the nexus should make it through the day for most users, you’ll have to remember to plug it in at night . if you play a lot of games or shoot a lot of video, you’ll be happy that the nexus supports fast charging . if you need to charge quickly, the 6 supports a fast charging mode which is able to charge the battery at up to 14 . 4 watts . the fastest ‘regular’ charging i have seen are devices which are able to handle 11 or 12 watts so the 6 is able to charge a full 20% faster . in case you’re wondering, the note 4 can do even better by charging at 15 watts . check out the picture of the included fast charger, it's not a very power outlet friendly shape because there's a good chance it will block the adjacent plug . in case you're wondering, the note 4's charger doesn't block other outlets . conclusion: . it used to be that picking up a nexus phone meant a few things . think of these as my rules for a nexus . unlocked - even if you got it from a carrier . no carrier crapware - even if you got it from a carrier . no resource sucking manufacturer crapware . receives updates whenever a new version of android comes out . receives updates directly from google without approval from your carrier . unlocked boot loader out of the box so you can flash whatever software you want . comes with the latest hardware . as andrew mentioned, the at&t version of the nexus 6 is locked . fortunately, the nexus 6 which i have here was supplied from rogers and they didn’t mess with it . the boot loader is unlockable, and while the nexus does install rogers’ apps when you activate it with a rogers sim, you can remove them or just activate it without the sim if you don’t want to see them at all . most importantly, the 6 they sent me is unlocked so you can use it on any carrier you want . so in this case, rogers deserves a high five for leaving the 6 alone while at&t deserves five across the eyes of making their version of the 6 suck . okay, it’s time for me to put my flame suit on but one other ‘feature’ of nexus devices is that they’ve always had one hardware flaw . the original nexus one had wonky menu buttons that didn’t always respond . the nexus s didn’t have a memory card slot even though the galaxy s it was based on had one . ditto for the galaxy nexus . the nexus 4 lacked lte while the nexus 5 only got a 5” display, a small battery and only a 8 megapixel camera . while the nexus 6 is the most ‘no compromises’ nexus yet, it’s been cursed with a dim screen and thus maintains the family’s flawed history . there’s one more nexus rule i forgot to mention: . priced so it’s a great deal . while having an affordable price wasn’t always a nexus hallmark, to me it’s become the most important one . the nexus really fails my final rule . if you want a great phone for that’s a steal, the nexus 6 is not the android you’re looking for . it's hard to figure out a rating for the nexus 6 . on one hand, it's a very solid phone, on the other hand it has a dim display and it's very expensive . at the nexus 6 price point, a phone should have no serious weaknesses so with that in mind i can only give it 3 . 5 out of 5 howies . i'd give it 4 but i took off half a howie due to the high price tag . it's been out nexused by the oneplus one . right now if i had to choose, the samsung galaxy note 4 would be my pick for favorite android phone . you can imagine how pumped i was when i found out that the samsung galaxy edge was coming here to north america . it’s just like the note 4 but the display has been swapped out for a curved, slightly higher resolution display that spills over the right side of the phone . if you’ve never seen one before, the effect is quite striking . let’s check it out: . availability: . in canada, the edge is available on rogers and bell for around $400 on-contract and $900 off which makes it more expensive than the 16gb iphone 6 plus .  . in the us, at&t has it for $945 . 99 straight up, $399 . 99 us or $31 . 54 for 30 months . verizon has it for $399 . 99, $33 . 33 for 24 months or $799 . 99 off-contract . t-mobile has it for $870 or $36 . 25 for 24 months . it’s $35 for 24 months on sprint, $840 off-contract or $429 . 99 on a 2 year . what about the samsung galaxy note 4 . is the edge really worth an extra $100 or so over the note 4? the quick answer is definitely not . the only reason to buy the edge is if you can appreciate the techo lust that the curved screen inspires . i mean when people see it, they’re definitely impressed . still, once they get past it, the next question is “what does the curved screen do?” . unfortunately, it doesn’t do much and worse yet, it makes the edge harder to use than the note 4 . samsung has tried their best to utilize the curve side’s extra space by migrating the notifications and app drawer there . it’s a sound idea in theory, but in practice, i found those 2 features constantly fighting over the same space . worse yet, since i usually use my phone in portrait mode, the landscape-oriented notifications are always at a 90 degree angle . if that’s not enough you can also put all sorts of other information on the side to clutter things even more . one other problem that i didn’t think about is that the edge’s extra width over the note 4 means it won’t fit in most car cup holders . i guess the nexus 6, passport and even the note 4 in a case have this problem too so i’m not sure how big a deal this really is . another problem is that the edge has a slightly larger display than the note 4 but it comes with a smaller battery . while i do think that most users will find the edge’s battery sufficient to make it through the day, i did notice that it drains a little faster than the note 4 . really, there’s no reason to pick up the edge unless you absolutely, positively must have a phone with a curved display at all costs and can overlook the problems that it causes . what about the google nexus 6 . in my nexus 6 review, i said that the note 4 is a better phone than the nexus 6 . while i still think than the nexus 6’s display needs to be brighter, i think that the edge’s inconvenient curved screen and smaller battery are enough to tip things in the nexus 6’s favor even when you consider the 6’s lack of a memory card and removable battery . while it’s no deal, the nexus 6 32gb is also $150 less than the edge . what about the iphone 6 plus . when apple introduced the iphone 6 plus with it’s plus-sized price tag, it sort of raised the ceiling on what manufacturers can charge for their phones . love or hate apple, their products usually dictate the most that a company can charge for their for non-niche products . while the edge has a more powerful speaker, removable battery, removable storage and it’s wacom powered s-pen stylus, the curved display is awkward to use which makes it a worse device . if you’re looking at dropping 900 bucks on a phone do yourself a favour, spend a little more and pick up the 6 plus 64gb . body: . the body is pretty similar to the note 4’s . screen aside, the edge is missing some of the fine details on the 4 . for example; the chamfering isn’t as pronounced on the note edge plus is lacks the built-up corners . speaking of the curved screen, i don’t know about you but the non-symmetrical design creates some tension when you look at it . it’s not a harmonious look . then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder so you can decide whether it makes the edge more striking or just kind of strange . i usually use my phones by holding them in my right hand than using my thumb to interact with the screen . the problem is that when i hold the edge like this, my palm is all over the right side .  . samsung has done a good job of knowing when i have my palm on the side of the screen but occasionally it gets fooled and unexpected things happen . since the design is asymmetrical i also found that i made more typos than i would on a note 4 - then again, maybe i just need to get used to it more . the back cover has a faux leather finish . it’s not a bad attempt . since the right side has the curved portion of the screen, the power button that samsung typically puts there has been relocated to the top . this really annoyed me because a) having a right-mounted power button is a samsung paradigm b) my finger has to make its way to the top since the edge is a large phone . further, the power button feels cheap and doesn’t stick out as much as the one on the note 4’s . i’m not going to go too in-depth but the fingerprint reader works well . you do have to swipe it which makes it less convenient to use, but your finger can be at any angle so it’s still usable . i don’t imagine most people use the rear-facing uv sensor and heart-rate monitor but if you do then you’ll be happy to know that there aren’t many other phones which have this feature . the microusb and s-pen silo are at the bottom: . volume buttons are where they're supposed to be on the left side: . notice that the battery cover doesn't cover the entire back: . the included battery has a capacity of 3000mah vs the 3220mah included with the note 4 . display: . i have no idea if the edge has a glass or plastic display but it feels different from the note 4’s . while most phones including the note 4 have 16:9 ratio screens, the edge’s has a more square 16:10 aspect ratio . what this means is even though the edge’s screen measures only 5 . 6” diagonally, it’s actually larger than the note 4’s 5 . 7”, 16:9 display . the resolution is also slightly higher, 2560x1600 vs a mere 2560x1440 on the regular note 4 . that’s about an extra 11% more pixels . since the right-most part of the curved display is harder to see when you’re using the phone straight on - that area of the screen is reserved for the dock and notifications . the idea is that you can now fit more icons and widgets on your home screens plus the notifications no longer pop up at the top . the problem with moving the notifications on the side is that now you have to read them at a 90 degree angle . further, when you get notifications, the pop up sometimes covers up the rightmost part of the screen . talk about a horrible answer to a question that no one asked . then again, i guess some would say that pretty much sums up touch-wiz in general at this point in time . as for the dock, it sometimes fights the notifications for the same space . that mean’s it’s actually worse than just having the dock at the bottom like every other android phone . viewing angles are very good - just like the note 4, but the problem is that the display turns blue unless you’re looking at it straight on . the curved display really accentuates this problem . as for the display itself, it’s quite similar to the note 4’s . it’s really, really bright . it’s so bright that even though it’s an amoled display (which normally struggle outdoors), it kind of works in bright sunlight . blacks are extremely deep so contrast is off the charts . aside from the off-angle colour shift, i have no complaints about the display itself - it’s top notch . camera: . the camera is similar to the one in the note 4 . i compared some shots side-by-side and i think the edge has a slightly improved sensor . it’s a tiny bit cleaner . i found that it sometimes won’t focus, it’s not because the sensor isn’t capable of finding focus but it’s some sort of bug . samsung has moved the shutter button to the curved part of the screen . i think the idea is that by moving the shutter button out of the way, it’s no longer blocking your view . the problem with this is that generally speaking, shutter buttons are usually placed where they are so that you can trigger the shutter without causing your phone to shake too much . i had a much harder time holding the edge still while triggering the shutter . the location of the shutter button also makes it virtually impossible to take shots while holding the edge with just one hand . i found that the edge tends to take worse pictures because i got more blurry shots because of the shutter button placement . software: . like the note 4, the edge ships with android 4 . 4 and not android 5 - at least in canada as of february 18th 2015 . since lollipop has been available for a few months now and given that it’s a cutting edge device, i’m a little disappointed they didn’t toss android 5 in the mix . in terms of software, the edge is similar to the note 4 with a few key differences . first off, you know how i go on and on about how great samsung’s multi-window feature is in each samsung review i write? before you had to launch it by pressing and holding the back button and then selecting which windows you want . while you can still do this, now you can pop windows out by just swiping from the top left diagonally onto the screen . it’s a much more intuitive way to hover windows - just remember that it’s not support by most apps . since the edge has a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the more traditional 16:9 ratio, it’s screen is ‘wider’ . since part of the screen goes over the edge, the edge never uses the right part for apps . that area is reserved for what samsung calls their “panels” features . normally, the right side shows panels for the notification area along with icons from the dock . in case you’re wondering, you can still pull down from the top of the screen to access your switches and to view notifications, it’s just that notification toasts show up on the right side . you can cycle between the panels by swiping left or right . if that’s not enough, you can also add more panels . included are panels for the weather, stocks, how many steps you’ve taken today, twitter feeds, sports scores, quick dials and even a game . if that’s not enough, you can download another 12 from google play . the problem with all this is that the panels themselves are quite small so they can’t display too much information . it can also get very cluttered if you’re trying to use more than one or two panels . however, the worst thing about the panels is that i tend to use my phones in portrait mode and the panels themselves are landscape so you have to read everything at a 90 degree angle which is much more annoying that i thought it would be . don’t get me wrong, the panels are very cool but the problem is that they’re not particularly useful . certain built-in apps like the video player also use the panel to show the video scrubber and controls . again, it sounds like a cool idea since you don’t have controls overlaying what you’re watching but in practice, it makes the edge awkward to use . the rest of the software including samsung’s s-pen apps are present on the edge . performance: . no surprises here, the edge’s performance is very similar to the note 4’s and is in the same ballpark as the nexus 6 too . media capabilities: . media capabilities are identical to the note 4 . the headphone jack sounds great and is powerful . the built-in speaker doesn’t sound as nice as the nexus 6’s speakers but they are quite loud . if 32gb (gb usable) isn’t enough storage for you can add a microsd . as a phone: . if you're wondering how it handles as a phone it’s just like the note 4 meaning it has a powerful, above average earpiece, good sound quality and strong rf performance . where the edge sets itself apart is that bell and rogers are marketing it as the first phone sold by either that supports their carrier aggregation which they’re calling lte advanced . this means that the edge supports speeds of up to 225mbps on rogers and 183mbps on bell . rogers was kind enough to send me a demo sim to use with the edge . oh and in case you're wondering, i don't think you need a special sim card to use carrier aggregation . all you need is one that supports lte . in order to get speeds of 150mbps, rogers has to use their 20mhz of spectrum on band 7 . to get 75mbps they have to use 10mhz of their band 4 spectrum . with carrier aggregation they’re able to combine the 2 bands for a total speed of 225mbps (150 + 75) . here’s what i’m talking about . while carrier aggregation didn’t appear to be on everywhere, hc “no - i” figured out a way to force it on the edge . i found a decent spot and ran these tests: . here’s the result on band 4: . the result on band 7: . and here’s the result with carrier aggregation turned on (notice the “lte+”) . yup, the result is more-or-less the sum of the first two tests . by the way, if you look closely you’ll notice the time stamp for the ca test is earlier in the day, rest assured i was getting similar results when i ran the separate tests at night, i just forgot to take a screen grab then . 225mbps is a mighty impressive number and great for marketing purposes but some of you are probably wondering what use this is in the real world . i gave it a lot of thought and marketing aside, one scenario where carrier aggregation would be useful is if both bands are congested and you’re only able to get 2mbps on one and 2 on the other, well with ca you could get a usable 4mbps . here’s another more interesting observation: if you look carefully, while the download speed is very high, the upload speed is not aggregated and just appears to be using band 4 only . if you look at the band 7 upload speeds you’ll notice that they’re much faster . so, if you’re uploading videos from your phone, this is one scenario where carrier aggregation would actually cause things to run more slowly - at least until they’re able to aggregate the uplink also . conclusion: . while samsung deserves praise for bringing such an interesting device to the market, it’s really too bad they weren’t able to make the curved screen useful . technology for the sake of technology is cool but in the case of the edge, it doesn’t make it a better phone . while i gave the note 4, 4 . 5 howies, i’m taking off 0 . 5 howies from the edge’s score because it’s a actually worse phone . *update* the grand x plus z826 actually comes with 2gb of ram, not 1gb like i stated originally . in late 2013, an interesting trend emerged in the marketplace; motorola released the moto g which was the first relatively inexpensive phone that didn’t suck . the bar was raised in 2014; for the same money you could now pick up something with a quad-core processor, 5” hd display and a 8 megapixel autofocus camera: i’m talking phones like the zte grand x (z933 - canadian version) or the blu studio 5 . 0c hd . later in 2014 we got different permutations on this formula; the htc desire 510 and nokia lumia 635 added lte but they forced you to give up the 5” hd display and 8 megapixel camera . lte makes these phones more attractive to carriers but as far as i’m concerned, trading these 2 features to get lte is just not worth it . now we have the zte grand x plus (z826) . with the plus you get a 5” display, 8 megapixel camera, quad-core processor and lte . you don’t have to make any compromises! you get all this for $200 from fido . what about the motorola moto g 2nd gen . compared to the plus, the moto g has similar specs but you actually have to pay $50 more and give up lte . raw deal right? not so fast, while it’s not the most solid phone around, the g definitely feels more solid in my hand . it also has a louder earpiece, better sounding headphone jack and much better speakers . also, given motorola’s (and zte’s) track record, the g will probably receive android updates more frequently than the plus . if you can look past the plus' weaknesses, the real clincher is that the plus comes with 2gb of ram . off the top of my head, i can't think of any other phones that comes with 2gb of ram for this price . what about the zte grand x (z933) . just to clarify, i’m talking about the canadian version of the zte grand x, the z933 which has a 5” hd display, quad-core qualcomm snapdragon 200 processor, 1gb of ram and a 5 mp camera . don’t let the higher model number fool you; z826 > z933 . the grand x plus has a much better camera, 2gb of ram, lte and most importantly, a qualcomm snapdragon 400 instead of the grand x’s 200 . the 200 just isn’t up to the task of driving a 1280x720 hd display which results in a choppy user experience . body: . at a glance, the plus looks pretty similar to grand x (z933) . both have 5” displays and have similar curves . however, upon closer scrutiny, the plus’ body has a couple of improvements . first off, the power button has migrated from it’s perch at the top of the phone to the right side . i also like how the microusb has moved from the side and is now centered on the bottom . this makes the plus much easier to plug in at night . as for the build quality, like the x, the plus’ body and finishes feel a half step behind the competition . the back cover feels thin and has a bit of give to it . when you remove and attach the cover, it doesn’t snap on like most other phones . while i didn’t try it, it gives you the feeling that it’s going to fly off if you drop it . the paint job on the back doesn’t fill me with confidence . it gets dirty very easily and is hard to clean off . it feels like it won’t take much to scuff it up . i was kind of surprised that the volume and power buttons have a nice feel to them . ergonomics are good, most people will be able to use the plus with one hand . the menu keys are placed closer to the middle so you don’t hit them by accident . it also makes the screen bigger since the bottom part isn’t covered up with menu keys . behind the battery cover are a 2300mah battery along with the microsd and microsim slots . check it out, the plus is “designed in canada” . was the phone designed from scratch here? or did a product manager from fido specify that the plus needed to have support for a certain lte band? who knows but the “designed in canada” aspect is interesting . power button on the right . volume buttons on the left . microusb port on the bottom . headphone jack on top . display: . like it’s competitors, the plus has a 5”, 1280x720 ips display . ditto for the quality of the display . it’s not as bright as a flagship phone but it’s definitely bright enough for everyday use . colours look nice and view angles are good enough . we’re now at the point where the choice between an inexpensive phone and a flagship is whether you want a nice display or an awesome one . screen sharpness clocks in at just over 290ppi . these days flagships have ppi’s of over 400 but to my eyes, the difference between 400+ and 290ppi is a lot smaller than you’d think . the plus’ display is very sharp . compared to the moto g, the saturation on the plus is dialled back a tiny bit (not a bad thing) . when you’re viewing black, the plus screen is slightly more evenly lit . i did notice that the plus had 2 lit sub pixels . one was red and the other was red . i only noticed this when the screen was all black . under normal circumstances i didn’t notice them . camera: . on the back is an 8 megapixel, autofocus camera with led flash . i have a confession; i wasn’t expecting too much so in that sense, i was pretty impressed with the plus’ camera . no, it’s as good as the iphone 6 plus (which concidently costs 4 - 6x what the grand x plus costs) but it’s capable of taking decent pics . it doesn’t blow out pictures like the moto x 2nd gen does nor does it over-saturate to the degree the alcatel idol 2s does . it’s not bad in the dark and manages to do so without excessive noise . focusing is pretty fast and shot to shot speeds are good for the class . the lens had a fairly wide angle, i’m guessing it’s the equivalent to around 28 or 30mm on a 35mm camera . despite the $200 price tag, this isn’t some budget basement 8 megapixel sensor - it’s surprisingly good . the camcorder can record at 1080p (moto g only does 720p) . video quality was acceptable but the digital stabilization wasn’t very effective and the microphone picks up a lot of handling noise . software: . the plus makes do with android 4 . 4 . it’s not the latest version but i guess there aren’t that many phones shipping with lollipop at this point so this should be no surprise . i’m not sure if the plus will receive any updates, i have a grand x from a few months ago and it’s still on 4 . 3 so manage your expectations accordingly . you get zte’s custom launcher which isn’t too heavy . the most noticeable features are that the lock screen has been changed so that you just have to press and hold it to unlock or press and hold the lock screen apps to launch them . hc - “no i” noticed that the home screen has a background picture blur feature (press and hold the back button and then swipe up) . you can “bokeh” up your pictures . you get google’s apps and then zte’s versions of them . so, you get 2 browsers, 2 music players, 2 image viewers . while the plus doesn’t feel too bloated, i noticed that it only has 4 . 5gb of usable storage vs 5 . 5gb on the moto g 2nd gen so there’s something using up an extra gb of space . hmmm… . like other android phones, there’s a hotspot feature so you can use the plus to get other devices connected . i could be wrong here but i haven’t seen plus’ wps feature on other phones . you can use wps to easily connect other devices to it . performance: . powering the show is a quad-core 1 . 2ghz qualcomm snapdragon 400 soc . you’ll find the same soc in the moto g 2nd gen and the alcatel idol 2s along with many other mid-range phones a lot of which cost more than $200 . benchmarks are pretty much what you’d expect from a 400 . there’s really nothing to see . the snapdragon 400 is perfectly adequate to the task of driving the hd display . in the plus it offers reasonably smooth performance . apps load quickly and i never got the feeling that it was struggling (except when running very high-end benchmarks) . media capabilities: . there’s a single speaker on the back . while i wouldn’t say it’s terrible the best thing i can say about it is that its serviceable - the front facing speakers on the 2nd gen moto g blows it away . unlike many of last year’s sub-$200 phones, the plus comes with 8gb of storage instead of just 4gb . you can expand the storage with microsd cards . the headphone jack sounds awful . there’s some sort of signal processing going on that over-emphasizes the bass and pretty much ruins everything else . everything except the bass sounds muddy like there’s a blanket covering it . as a phone: . sound quality is good . rf performance is average . maximum earpiece volume is average - it’s slightly quieter than the moto g 2nd gen . mxximum speakerphone volume is also slightly quieter than the g . you get a 2300mah battery on a phone with a 5” display and lte . i think regular users (normobs)  . can get a full day while power users will have to top off halfway through the day . conclusion: . let’s get this out of the way, i’m floored at what a good deal the zte grand x plus is . aside from the back cover which feels a little cheap, there’s nothing really wrong with it . it’s got all the features most users want and for the most part, the features work just fine . one problem if you could call it that is that phones in general have reached a point where we don’t really need to wait for the next flagship to get a phone that can do everything you need it to . okay, that’s not really a problem for us consumers but it’s a problem for manufacturers like samsung who want to charge you $700 for a phone . and guess what, phones like the zte are the source of that problem . yes, a flagship is better, but the zte is good enough . since flagship phones displays have been increasing in size over the past few years, new segments in the market have opened up for phones which have slightly smaller displays . one interesting segment are smaller versions of flagship phones . one of the first was the gs3 mini; which was really a budget phone named after the gs3 . this trend continued the following year with the htc one mini and gs4 mini . however, earlier this year sony added a twist to this trend when they released the z1 compact . unlike the competition, the z1 compact was not a budget phone in expensive clothes; it was the first ‘mini’ phone with full-sized specs . here’s their follow up, the z3 compact . let's check it out: . what about the samsung galaxy alpha . since the z3 compact was released, samsung has jumped on-board the small phone, big spec bandwagon with the samsung galaxy alpha . the samsung galaxy alpha is basically the ‘mini’ version of the gs5 . like the compact, the alpha makes very few compromises to fit into its more svelte form factor . that said, compared to the z3 compact, samsung has left more on the table with the alpha . to be honest, there’s no comparison between the two . there’s one spec which really stands out that demonstrates how serious sony is with the compact . the compact is packing a 2600mah battery while the alpha has an embarrassingly small 1860mah . battery-wise, samsung brought a knife, to a gun fight . you do get a removable battery with the alpha and guess what; if you’re a power user you might actually have to use this feature since the battery is so small . don’t forget that even though the battery is removable, the alpha lacks the compact’s microsd . if that’s not enough, the compact has the same camera as the z3 while the alpha has to make due with a different lower quality camera compared to what you get with the gs5 . the alpha does have sexy metal sides but the edges . just remember, samsung is still kind of new to the metal phone game so they made the rookie mistake of making the sides too hard, so the alpha is not very comfortable to hold . sony made the same mistake last year with the z1 . i do like the fingerprint reader on the alpha which is genuinely useful since most people have to unlock their phone many times a day . then again, the z3 compact counters with water and dust resistance which is also a very practical feature . while the choice between z3 and gs5 is difficult, if you have to choose between the alpha and z3 compact it’s not even close . compact all the way . what about the sony xperia z3 . if you’re a sony fan, then you have to pick between the z3 compact and its larger brother, the z3 . while both have very similar specs, there are a few subtle differences between them . first off, the z3 has a larger 5 . 2” display while the compact’s is only 4 . 6” . practically speaking, there is a difference when you use them . these days, android seems to be optimized for screens that around 5” in size so when you use the z3, everything feels right . on the compact, everything on the screen feels a little more cramped . while the z3 has a larger footprint than the compact, the compact is noticeably thicker . it doesn’t bother me at all but it does feel a bit chubby when you have them side-by-side . the z3 has exposed metal sides which feel very classy . the compact has metal sides too but they’re covered with a round layer of cheap-feeling soft plastic . the z3’s stereo speakers are more powerful and have better sound quality . between them, it’s a tough choice . unless you really need a smaller phone, i’d probably lean towards the z3 myself but it’s really a personal decision . one thing i can say is that you really don’t sacrifice anything meaningful with the compact . pricing: . in canada, the z3 compact can be picked up for $149 . 99 can on contract or $549 . 99 off-contract on bell . if you get it from the sony store, it’s $599 . 99 can or $529 . 99 usd unlocked . spoiler alert; the z3 compact is an awesome phone and it’s a bit of a crime that it’s not more widely available . then again, since it’s only $100 less than the full sized z3, i think many people would rather just opt for that . i don’t know about you but it seems sony is constantly putting out new flagships . indeed, recently they’ve had a policy of releasing a new flagship every 6 months . the problem with this is that that newer versions often don’t differ much from previous versions . the upside is that this helps to really put downward pressure on the prices of their older models which are almost as good as the newer ones . of course, if you end up buying the latest model you might feel burned when rumors of its replacement start making the rounds a week later but i guess that’s part of the sony xperience . here’s sony’s latest, the xperia z3 . what about the xperia z2 . right now, the z2 can be found for $100 less at the sony store or much cheaper if you look for a used one . is the z3 worth another $100? i’ll have to say a very definite maybe . for you extra money, you get a slight smaller phone with a brighter display and much better speakers . the performance is more or less identical as are the cameras . actually, the best thing about the z3 is that it really helps to clobber the z2’s resalel values . before the z3 came out, the z2 sold for $699 canadian at the sony store, now you can pick them up for around $400 canadian . if you want a sony that’s almost as good as the z3 then just think about getting a z2 . what about the xperia z1 . if follow the ‘just get a z2’ reasoning, then what happens if you take it one step further and just get last year’s z1 . while the z1 doesn’t do anything better than the z2 or z3, used ones can be picked up for less than half what a brand new z3 costs . so what do you give up? first off, the z1 has much harder corners so it’s not that comfortable to hold for long periods of time . the display has quite a bit of colour and contrast shift so that’s something else to think about . it has an older snapdragon 800 soc vs the 801 in the z2 and z3 but it’s probably not something you’d notice . i checked out kijiji and you can pick one up for around $300 . i’d say spend the money and just get the z2 . what about the samsung galaxy s5/s5 active . while there are plenty of flagships, the only others which are water resistant are samsung’s gs5 and it’s more durable brother, the gs5 active .  . the z3 has a slightly bigger display, an extra gigabyte of ram, larger battery, stereo speakers, plus its metal and glass body are a classier package . with the gs5, you get a removable battery, infrared blaster, a heart rate monitor on the back plus the regular version comes with a fingerprint reader . if you opt for the active, you give up the fingerprint reader for some extra durability and an extra software button . as a gs5 owner, while i think the fingerprint reader is a genuinely nice thing to have, the rest of the samsung features are just fluff . i never use the heart rate monitor, the infrared blaster is crippled with completely useless software . the active on the other hand is a bit more competitive simply because there’s nothing else on the market that blends the active’s toughness with it’s high-end feature set . last year, motorola’s flagship, the moto x kind of got lost in the shuffle . while it was a solid effort of motorola’s part, some of the features they gave it to differentiate it from the competition didn’t really catch on . the specs weren’t up to, well, they weren’t up to spec and one of the most important differentiators, the customizability wasn’t even available in canada! to be honest, i’m surprised they sold any here . this time around, let’s see if the second gen x fares any better: . pricing: . like last year, motorola has priced the x’s srp slightly lower than the competition ($600 vs ~$700), this carries over once subsidies have been taken into account; the gs5 goes for around $200 while the moto x is only $100 . in the us, the x starts at $499 . 99 direct from motorola . the 32gb variant adds $50 while getting a leather or wood back tacks on another $25 . after subsidy, the us x starts at $99 and goes up to $174 . 99 if you opt for 32gb and wood or leather . what about the gs5 . with the gs5, you get a removable battery, microsd card slot, fingerprint reader (a useful feature), heart rate monitor (not a useful feature) and water resistance . the moto x has a slightly larger display, more frequent updates and a metal body which makes it feel more special in my hand . is the gs5 worth $100 more than the x? i’d say yes, simply because it comes with a microsd slot though the fingerprint reader is also a nice feature . what about the lg g3: . the g3 has a larger display, stabilized lens, microsd and a larger removable battery . note that i didn’t mention the higher resolution display because practically speaking, it doesn’t make any difference . the x counters with a very stylish metal body . when you put the g3 next to the x, the x looks sleek and stylish while the g3 and feels like it’s trying to apologize for being made from plastic with it’s vulgar looking faux finishes . the x also gets more android updates . to be honest, i don’t really have strong feelings one way or the the other between the x and g3 . what about the oneplus one: . in a way the oneplus one is the closest competitor to the x because of its cost . while the opo is still close to $200 less, the x is still $100 closer than the other flagships . the opo is available with 64gb of storage, plus has a larger display, more ram, a much larger battery and most importantly, a lower price . both receive many updates to the point that it may annoy some less demanding users . both displays have minor flaws, the opo is slightly washed out, while the x is a little over saturated . here’s the htc desire 510 . it’s a new entry-level-ish phone with lte from htc that costs $180 canadian off-contract . currently, the under $200 market in canada requires you to make a choice . you basically have to choose between having a high definition display or having lte . you can’t have both unless you’re willing to spend another $50 . the problem with this is that both high def screens and lte are awesome features . if a phone were ice cream, a hd display would be chocolate sauce while lte would be peanuts - it’s not a choice you want to have to make . when you have lte, apps download faster, webpages pop up more quickly, and in general, you do less waiting . on the other hand, high definition displays are usually nicer to look at . there’s no blockiness or jagged edges to distract you . so where does the desire fit in? it has lte which is great and a 854x480 display which isn’t so great . let’s check it out: . what about the nokia lumia 635 . the first competitor that pops into my head is actually a windows phone . the nokia lumia 635 also has a 4 . 7” 854x480 display, 8gb of storage a 5 megapixel camera and lte . if you can look past the fact that it comes with windows phone, the 635 has a better camera and a much better screen . while the 635 also has a low resolution display, it has nice colours and respectable viewing angles . i can live with a low resolution display if it looks nice but unfortunately, that’s not the desire’s . ditto for the camera, the 635’s camera is only 5 megapixels but it actually takes pretty decent photos for a budget shooter . that’s really the choice you have to make between these 2; if you can deal with windows phone and it’s somewhat boring app ecosystem, you’ll be rewarded with a better camera and display . what about the 2013 moto g . when it comes to budget phones with a hd display, last year’s moto g (not to be confused with this year’s moto g which i’m currently reviewing) is the poster child for an affordable phone that doesn’t suck . when it was announced, people were awestruck that moto managed to stuff a high definition display into a phone at it’s price point . that said, with 5” fast becoming the new standard, it’s 4 . 5” display is starting to feels really cramped . don’t forget that the moto g’s uses on-screen buttons which effectively shrinks the display further . to be honest, while the moto g is nice and sharp, it’s small screen has kept it from aging well . that said, while the desire’s display is a smidge larger at 4 . 7”, overall the display is pretty awful . i suppose it looks good enough straight-on but if you’re not directly in front it has all sorts of colour and contrast shift . it also uses on-screen buttons which shrinks the effective size of the screen . you do get a microsd slot with the desire which is one of the moto g’s biggest omissions - at least on the 8gb hspa variant . still, the moto g is considerably cheaper than the desire - i’ve seen it go for as low as $110 canadian and it’s even cheaper south of the border . unless you can find the desire on a big discount, the choice is easy here, pick up the moto g . what about the alcatel pop icon . the pop icon has a large 5” display plus hardware menu buttons so it’s quite a bit larger than the 510’s 4 . 7” display . unlike pretty much every other phone on the market, the pop has a matte display which is really great indoors because it’s much less reflective . the problem is that it’s almost impossible to see when you’re outdoors which explains why every other phone on the market has a glossy display . that one feature alone is why i’d avoid the pop icon and choose the desire . aside from lte, the desire pulls head in the processor department with a beefier snapdragon 400 soc vs the more humble snapdragon 200 in the pop icon plus the htc also comes with 8gb of storage vs 4gb on the pop icon . what about the zte grand x . the grand x which is available from bell and different from the grand x available in the us, pulls ahead with a nice-for-this-segment 5”, 1280x720 high definition display that also has separate menu buttons . the desire has a faster processor (snapdragon 400 vs 200), more storage (8gb vs 4gb) a newer version of android (4 . 4 vs 4 . 3) and of course, lte . in a way, the desire looks better on paper but the larger 5” high definition display is a really nice feature . having only 4gb of storage isn’t that practical because many apps will only install in the built-in storage . as for the android 4 . 3 vs 4 . 4 issue, i don’t think it’s that big a deal . the difference between 4 . 3 and 4 . 4 isn’t that big . the bigger question is if either of these phones will receive updates . zte doesn’t really have a history in canada but i will say that if they chose to launch with 4 . 3 when 4 . 4 is currently available that says a lot about how many updates it will probably receive . with the desire, it’s a little trickier; htc keeps their flagship devices updated but i’m not sure how they are with their midrange and entry level devices . this is a tough choice, the zte has a nice big display but it also only comes with 4gb of storage . the desire has a faster processor and lte but an ugly screen . what about the blu studio 5 . 0c hd . finally, we have the blu studio 5 . 0c hd . the only phone i’m comparing that doesn’t come with a qualcomm processor . in terms of power, the mediatek soc in the blu ranks somewhere between a qualcomm snapdragon 200 and 400 so it’s a little slower than the desire’s, at least in terms of graphics performance . the blu’s has the following features going for it: dual sim, support for hspa 850/1700/1900 (works on all hspa carriers in canada and i think the us), a better camera and 5” high definition display that looks much nicer than the desire’s . with the desire you get lte, 8gb of storage (vs 4gb) and stronger rf performance . if you can find a blu and get a deal on it, i’d pick that over the htc . disappointing yet sexy .  . that's how i'm describing this "new" samsung phone . as a disclaimer, having this phone will not increase the owner's sex appeal so i wouldn't make any rush decisions . but the bottom line for the samsung galaxy alpha is that this is the biggest tease on the market . it truly is the alpha male in the smartphone arena making it that grey dude in that fifty shades of something-or-other . [and yes, i would say if the blackberry z10 and htc one shacked up, the galaxy alpha would pop out] . hardmetal: . as much as carbon fibre is stronger than steel, there is something beyond the scientific properties of a substance that communicate strength and confidence . a big grievance that i've had with samsung's smartphones is the cheap plastic materials used . in a marketplace where apple has produced great strides in the manufacturing process of aluminum/aluminium, there doesn't appear to be any reasonable explanation for any lagging from samsung . even though this galaxy alpha metal is limited to the aluminum frame, it's feels far more polished and precise than what the iphone 5s has . i only had 5min with the iphone 6 but the brushed finish doesn't have the flare of a reflective, glossy polish .  . the frame and the front glass meet with a degree of accuracy on par with apple's products . it's impressive how the transition from the two materials is rather transparent making it feel as one . again more sex-language to insert here: two become one . furthermore, the galaxy alpha feels rock solid - nice and hard and substantial in your hand . the weight distribution is typical samsung but because of the materials, there's a sense of intention or deliberateness to the assembled product . well done, south koreans!  . the big tease ends with the let-down: the rear plastic cover . it's flimsy and the extreme antithesis to the metal frame . understandably, this is the compromise you make for a removable battery (yet oddly no expandable microsd slot - see the complaints list below) . i think samsung should have gone all the way with this phone and stick out from the galaxy of galaxy's and wrap the whole thing up in aluminum or something other than plastic . flimsy and sexy don't go together for some reason .  . hardware: . because i'm the resident apple guy, i had to do some research to get the specs but as you should know by now, technical specs are rubbish in my opinion . and the public is well aware of the futile battle processor speed and core count is . the critical question to answer at the end of any spec sheet is this: does it work? and we have become like the spoiled child that wants it all even though we only really use less than a third of it's capability . my final note about this hardware stuff is that the software is where the rubber hits the road . just like the relationship between driver and automobile or photographer and camera, power/capability is only as good as what controls it .  . the samsung galaxy alpha has a snapdragon 801 soc quadcore processor running at 2 . 5ghz and 2gb of ram . it is the opinion of this reviewer that it really isn’t relevant because there isn’t anything you can do about it . maybe one day processor swaps will be commonplace but i don’t see that being a viable business model . what really is important is available storage . there is 32gb of internal storage and no microsd expansion slot like that galaxy s5 has .  . as an apple guy, i don’t have any grounds to complain about this considering i was able to thoroughly enjoy the nexus 4 with 8gb of memory . but the rest of you iphone haters should be outraged and take to social media to express your disappointment at this oversight . when i heard that you could stick a 128gb card in the galaxy s5, i was comprehensively impressed . why did samsung omit expandable memory from the alpha? it’s another tease . want another thing to complain about? display . at 4 . 7”, the super amoled display on the alpha is gorgeous . the colours are accurate and backlighting is fantastic . outdoor performance is right on par with the 5s . however, the resolution is 1280x720 – that’s right, not 1080 . granted, the iphone 6 isn’t 1080p either but it is indeed possible to fit that many pixels in a 4 . 7” phone: htc one . now that is a great phone with the whole metal thing going on too… i just couldn’t describe it sexy like the alpha . it’s just seriously annoying that samsung of all companies missed the mark with this resolution battle . whoever was picking the parts for this phone must have grabbed the wrong bucket because i’m certain samsung already has the world’s first 4 . 7” display with 4k resolution .  . the final thing i will say about hardware is the battery . in the alpha, it’s rated at 1860mah which samsung claims will provide up to 9hrs of talk time . who cares? my real world experience was equal to my 5s which means i get about 12hrs of battery life considering the poor cell signal in my office cubicle and a decent volume of emails/messages i get daily . so the battery is adequate but has the clear advantage of being replaceable .  . one side note that got me thinking… if it’s possible to easily remove the battery from the phone, is there a ‘dark’ market out there for stolen batteries? but i guess it’s also easy to steal your simcard or microsd card . hmmm… . to sum up the hard stuff in the galaxy alpha, my opinion is that samsung could’ve (no, should’ve) done better . put the best, most powerful and efficient processor in it . throw in a wicked battery and that magic 4k display . and samsung could price it accordingly and there would still be a preorder list for the preorders . unfortunately, there isn’t much hope for the innards . not so hardware: . i’ll be upfront and honest with my dislike of android . i’ve tried to like it and can see what it does well . i could imagine a pure, virgin version of kitkat is great but when it’s customized by samsung, it gets bulky like dragging other stuff behind you . there isn’t any lagging but it behaves like a heavy os . there have been some samsung apps that i’ve appreciated like the s-pen stuff in the note series .  . because the os is essentially the same as found in the galaxy s5, you can refer to steve’s awesome in-depth review . because i’ve got nothing more to add here . without a doubt, the phone can make calls like a phone should . emails and messages do what they need to do .  . a couple things to take note of is the fingerprint scanner . you have to swipe your digit across the home button . this is disappointing as i find the iphone’s solution much better . admittedly, i’ve almost dropped the alpha when swiping my thumb while holding the phone with one hand . furthermore, i found that it is very picky with what angle you swipe down from . in the end, i turned it off because it was getting really annoying and i didn’t want to drop this tester phone . the other thing is the camera . i’m a big fan of samsung’s customized camera app and the actual results from the lens . it’s a 12mp cmos sensor that does remarkably well with adequate available light . but like all phone cameras, it struggles in low light . i like the added functions like dual camera and surround shot . and selective focus is very quick to respond to user input . i believe the galaxy s5 has a 16mp sensor but i don’t see a difference in image quality . but keep in mind that there isn't any expandable memory… fortunately, there are more solutions available like dropbox, onedrive and so on to mitigate memory anxiety .  . my constant complaint with samsung is the soft buttons for ‘multitask' and ‘back’ – i can’t stand these . they get in the way of almost everything . like i’m trying to watch a video, pick up the phone and my thumb grazes the back button . it also happened frequently when taking photos the correct way (holding the phone in landscape orientation) . as much as i can see their convenience value, it’s just annoying and something that isn’t specific to this galaxy alpha .  . phonesex . i haven’t reviewed as many phones as the other veterans here but last year i noticed the change in audio quality in my iphone 5s for cellular based calls . it was clearer and the frequency range was wider . while i realize this feature is dependent on your carrier’s capabilities, it also needs the phone’s hardware/software to support it . this was the first samsung phone that i’ve tested call quality with and it was about the same as the iphone . what lagged behind was voip based calls – i found the audio to be rather thin and on the treble end of tone . granted, i compared this using skype on the alpha and iphone so it could very well be a limitation of the app and not necessarily the phone hardware .  . as far as cellular reception goes, this particular test phone was connected to the bell network and i had no complaints here . but when it comes to data over cellular, lte signal strength was either full or weak with nothing in the middle . the alpha does support bands 1-5, 7, 17 and 29 . i’m not an expert in this field but the best i could manage off speedtest was around 40mbps download and 26mbps upload . i’m sure there are many factors interplaying here but i’d at least like to share my real-world experience .  . one final note on this whole phone functionality on the galaxy alpha is with a feature i tried called “noise reduction” . bottom line is that i didn’t notice any difference with it on or off . it’s difficult to define what “noise” is but i tried it with a fan in the background thinking that the software should be able to handle that type of constant hum but it didn’t . then i tried it with wind noise in the car with the windows slightly open . it just didn’t do anything . but i’d like to think that this should be on by default anyways as a phone function, and perhaps defined differently when using speakerphone or a headset . it’s a good idea but better if it actually did something material to audio quality rather than teasing the user into thinking it will be like those headphones people wear on airplanes . hardstop: . how do i conclude this review in a manner that doesn’t get me into too much trouble? perhaps a story about my wife will be the compromise . when my wife started to read the fifty shades of grey series like almost every other woman on the planet, i had to go through the mental exercise of determining what it all means for me and my manhood: was it the end or the beginning? would i be compared to a fictional character or feel shame for not having ‘this’ or being ‘that’? now that the movie is coming out, i’ll have to decide whether i want that to be our date night activity . there’s a lot at stake here and what i am absolutely certain of is managing expectations . i don’t want to misrepresent myself by trying to be someone that i’m not . i don’t want to mislead my wife into thinking that i’m interested in sharing this fictional novel experience with her .  .  . my opinion about the samsung galaxy alpha is centred around the idea of misrepresentation and titillation . imagine being blindfolded and having this solid phone in your hands . your mind takes off into assuming it is the best galaxy smartphone yet . even the name is misleading you to picture it as finally whipping the iphone into submission and dominating the market .  . the dream ends when the blindfold is removed and you’re left disappointed in a seemingly unfinished product . what the hell happened? you’ll have to wait for the sequel to get a wee bit closer to the real thing . i am left feeling disappointed with this phone yet unwittingly hopeful of what is yet to come from samsung . i give the samsung galaxy alpha 3 christian grey howies out of 5 . here’s my samsung galaxy s5 active review . since i’ve already reviewing the gs5 and *spoiler alert* it’s basically the gs5 with more plastic on it . i’m not going to go as in-depth with the active . it’s more a comparison of the active with the regular gs5 . since the gs5 active is the “active”, does that make the regular gs5 the “galaxy s5 couch potato” . what about the samsung galaxy s5 . the active is the ruggedized version of the gs5 . make sure you check out our gs5 review . if it were a car, you could think of it as an off-road version of an existing car . it’s been raised, has taller tires, 4 wheel drive and thicker, more rugged looking plastic on the body . while you can’t put taller tires and 4wd on a gs5 (not really anyways), the active is clad with more plastic . the corners have been reinforced with extra padding plus their more rounded . this helps to dissipate energy when you drop it and it lands on a corner but it also makes it a little thicker and increases the gs5 active’s footprint albeit only slightly . i like how there is a lip that extends around the screen which makes the screen slightly recessed . that should help protect the screen when you drop it accidentally . on the back, the battery cover has been reinforced with beefier latches which makes it harder to remove .  . it's also smaller and doesn’t extend to the edges . these changes make the cover less likely to fly off when you drop it . the cover on the charger has a deeper, gasket . it’s easier to pull off compared to the gs5’s because the part where you stick your fingernail in to pop it out is on the top and bottom instead of on the side . in front, the menu buttons are all actual physical buttons which you can press . you also get an extra button on the left side of the phone which you can map to your favorite application . it can differentiate between short and long presses . by default, short pressing it brings up samsung’s activity zone app while a long press launches the push-to-talk app . i also noticed the finishes on the phone are hardier and aren’t glossy so that they’re more resistant to scratches . when you squeeze and twist the active you’ll find that it flexes less too so it appears to have a reinforced frame . the amount of padding and bracing seems to be a trade off between making the active more durable without making it too heavy and bulky - it is unquestionably going to be more durable than a regular gs5 but it’s not as idiot proof as a sonim xp7 . it probably won’t show as much damage like a gs5 would when you drop it but it will likely show some . you gain a lot of ruggedness but do you have to give up anything . most noticeably, you give up the fingerprint reader . as a gs5 owner i can honestly say that the fingerprint reader is a great feature . while it’s not as convenient to use as apple’s touchid, it’s still easy enough to use . you also lose the gs5’s usb 3 . 0 port but from my experience, this is actually a good thing . i’ve noticed that the gs5/note 3’s usb 3 . 0 port isn’t really any faster than a good usb 2 . 0 port (like the htc one m8 or note 4) plus a usb 3 . 0 port is harder to plug in at night . other then that, i don’t see much difference between the 2 phones . the added padding doesn’t really change how you use the gs5 active . in fact, i’d argue that the extra thickness and rougher surfaces makes it a little easier to hold and use since the regular gs5 is a bit thin for my taste . otherwise, the screen appears to be identical as is the camera, battery, processor, etc . i suppose as the flagship device, the gs5 might receive firmware updates for a longer period of time but that is purely speculation . consider this, 2 . 5 years ago samsung brought out the galaxy s iii . at around the same time they also brought out the galaxy rugby lte which was similar to the s iii . the gsiii is currently running android 4 . 4 while the rugby lte only has 4 . 0 . then again, compared to the rugby lte, the active is not as rugged and i think of it as being more of a mainstream device so the chances of it receiving updates is greater . as far as pricing goes, the active is $250 on a 2 year contract on all 3 carriers . the off-contract pricing is $700 on bell, $730 on rogers and $750 on telus . on contract, the regular gs5 is $200 and is sometimes discounted . in the us, both have been on the market for about the same amount of time and while on at&t the active costs $10 more than the regular, they both cost the same on contract . it only took 5 years but apple is now back to parity with samsung when it comes to screen-size . with that in mind, samsung is now under even more pressure to make sure that they deliver a hit with the galaxy note 4 . did samsung deliver the goods? let’s check it out: . what about the note 3 . on paper, the difference between the note 3 and 4 is minimal . the screen resolution is higher and you get a newer soc . both cameras receive a bump in resolution plus you get a fingerprint reader, uv sensor, heart rate monitor and fast charging . as it turns out, the note 4 is a noticeable upgrade from the 3 . while the extra screen resolution doesn’t really make any difference, the screen itself is a big improvement . it looks more natural and whites are cleaner though also introduces some noticeable off-angle colour shift . performance is more or less the same because all the extra performance is eaten up by the extra screen resolution . the camera is a big step forward in terms of image quality . you also get an optically stabilized lens . the fingerprint reader is usable and a nice thing to have . the uv sensor, heart rate monitor and fast charger are also nice but i think most people aren’t going to use them . however, the biggest difference between the 2 is how they feel in your hand . the 4 has an exposed metal frame which really makes it feel much more expensive . bottom line, if you have a note 3 and are happy with it, keep it . however, if you drop the money and upgrade to the 4, chances are you’ll be happy . what about the iphone 6 plus . the biggest problem with the note 4 is that while it’s a brilliant device with no significant weaknesses, you can now buy an iphone that’s more or less the same size . now let me give credit where credit is due; samsung has done a great job designing and marketing their galaxy line up . that being said, at least part of their success is because up until now, their phones are an alternative for people who want something bigger than an iphone . now that apple is also playing the size game, one of samsung’s major advantages is now gone . if you want a iphone with a large display, you can just buy an iphone . both have metal bodies so it’s hard to pick one over the other . i prefer holding the note 4 because it feels more substantial . the 6 plus is a bit too thin for my tastes . i’m also not a fan of of the curved edges on the plus’ display - it just feels really cheesy . the note 4 also has curved edges but it’s not as exaggerated as the plus’ . then again, if we’re going to talk cheese, the 4 has a faux leather back . it’s a toss up here . as for the displays, it’s also a toss up . the plus is better off-angle and has more natural looking colour . the 4 display has deeper blacks and more contrast . in case you’re wondering, why i didn’t mention resolution, that’s because for all intents and purposes, it’s not important when comparing the 2 because both are incredibly sharp . actually, when i look closely, i prefer the plus’ display because the 4’s is laid out in a pentile arrangement so solid colours looks grainy up close - not that you’d ever notice this unless you looked really hard . as for the cameras, i’d give the plus an edge . while it has lower resolution, i get more keepers when i use it . if you take a lot of selfies i’d also prefer the plus since the 4’s wide-angle front facing camera is weird to use plus it makes you look 10lbs heavier if you use it up close . on the software front, it’s an ios vs android and touchwiz decision . some people love ios and think android is the worst thing ever and others feel the opposite . i’m going to sit this one out not take sides . i guess, since we’re talking about samsung here i need to talk about the ‘extras’ . the fingerprint reader, uv sensor and heart rate monitor specifically . i prefer the plus’ fingerprint reader because it’s easier to use but then again, the 4’s isn’t exactly hard to use . as for the heart rate monitor - let’s just say that i haven’t used the one built into my gs5 in months . if i wanted to monitor my heart rate i would just buy a fitness band with one built in . some, will find it useful, i’m betting most won’t . as for the uv sensor, i also think that while some will use it, even more won’t . i don’t use the s-pen and i’m guessing those who do use it, can be served just as well with a regular capacitive stylus . performance-wise, it’s a toss up . while the plus does better in benchmarks, the benchmarks don’t reveal one big problem with the plus; it only comes with 1gb of ram . when you use a plus and switch programs, a lot of the time you have to wait for the program to re-launch when you switch back . it’s especially noticeable if you’re playing games and it really annoys the hell out of me . with 3gb of ram, the note 4 almost never has to relaunch anything . then there’s the fast charging . it’s a cool feature but you know what? the note 4 has a 3220mah battery - a lot of people aren’t going to need to charge it halfway through the day . i guess it could be useful if you forget to charge your phone regularly . price-wise, in canada the note 4 is going to be $799 unlocked or $299 on contract (on bell) while the 6 plus is $859 unlocked or $359 on contract . keep in mind that at that price is the note 4 comes with 32gb of storage while the 6 plus only gets 16gb . unless you're the type of user who doesn't load many apps on their phone, 16gb of storage is much too small . a more reasonable 6 plus is the 64gb variant that costs $969/484 . 99 . so now we're talking $969 vs $799 . i'll be totally honest, while the 6 plus is an amazing device, paying $170 more for it is a total rip-off . in the us, the pricing is a little closer . on at&t the note 4 is going to be $799/299 while the t-mobile 64gb 6 plus is $849 before financing while an at&t locked one is $399 on contract . paying $50 usd more for a 64gb 6 plus is much more reasonable . anyways, if you want an iphone and a big screen then you now have more choice . that being said, samsung is ready and has really upped their game with the note 4 . what about the galaxy s5 . back when the original note came out, the difference between it and the galaxy s ii was very pronounced . 5 . 3” on a 16:10 display is a lot bigger than the gsii’s 4 . 3” . however, since the note 2, the size difference between the note and galaxy s line has been shrinking . on top of that, phones in general have been increasing in size to the point that even $150 phones come with 5” high definition displays . while the gs5 is smaller than the note 4, the difference between them isn’t that big to the point that now they’ve become competitors . if you can afford it, go with the note 4 for its metal frame and extra storage . there are other differences between them but those are the 2 worth mentioning . i just reviewed the iphone 6 plus, now it’s time to check out its smaller brother the iphone 6 . i’m assuming you’ve already read my 6 plus review . if you haven’t already, please check it out now because i’ll be referring to it throughout the review . while most of this review is new, the 6 and 6 plus are very similar phones so a few passages have been lifted from the plus review . should i keep my iphone 5s . if you’re coming from a 5s, then you might be intimidated by the jump up to the plus . after all, going from 4 to 5 . 5” is a big difference . while the difference between a 4” and the 6’s 4 . 7” is also quite large, 4 . 7” is a happy medium . like the 5s, the 6 can be used with one hand though it’s a bit trickier . if we look beyond size, the 6 brings some other improvements like a slightly better camera, a better screen, a tiny bit more performance which you probably won’t notice, the availability of a 128gb variant that costs roughly what the 64gb 5s did last year, support for lte band 7 (up to 150mbps) and slightly better battery life . what about the iphone 6 plus . the 6 plus has 4 points which make it better than the 6 . first and foremost is the larger display . there’s a big jump when you go from 4 . 7” to 5 . 5” .  . remember; gaming, surfing the web, looking at pictures, reading email are all better on a bigger screen . the 6 plus display is also sharper but most people won’t notice this . you also get an optically stabilized lens with the 6 plus and in case you’re wondering; yes it does make a difference . battery life on the 6 plus is also superior, or at least it should be . my 6 plus has some problems so i haven’t been able to get a real handle on this . so, while you get a bigger, sharper display, better camera and more battery life on the plus, you have to sacrifice some portability . the plus is a massive phone . in the quest to make it as thin as a kate moss, apple has given the 6 plus the footprint of a sumo wrestler .  . now you’re probably wondering about the 6 plus and what’s been dubbed “bendgate” . some people have stuffed the 6 plus in the pant pockets and after sitting down for a few hours, have found that it has been bent out of shape . here’s my take . did the 6 plus bend because it’s poorly made with the strength of a wet noodle? no . the problem with the 6 plus, is that it’s too long . it’s so long that when people put it in their pant pockets it’s subject to greater twisting and bending forces than other, shorter phones . think about it, imagine you put a toothpick in your pocket - chances are that it will be fine even if you spend the whole day sitting because it’s short . now take a thicker, stronger toothpick that is twice as long and put it in your pant pocket . it’s going to get bent out of shape because the length causes it to be subjected to more forces . anyways, the 6 is a much shorter phone . even if it’s actually weaker (i have no idea one way or the other), it won’t be subject to the same level of forces that the 6 plus will be . this makes it a much more pocket-friendly phone . what size do i need . like the plus, the 6 is available in 16, 64 and 128gb sizes . if you’re a casual user who plans on snapping a few pictures, download the facebook app and making some calls, then 16gb is enough . however, power users should avoid the 16gb version at all costs - you’ll be constantly running out of storage . when ios 7 came out, i couldn’t install it because i needed more than 5gb of free space . out of the box, the 16gb iphone 6 has around 14 . 7gb of usable space . if apple releases a new version of ios, how much free space will it need? it will drive you nuts because you’ll be constantly performing memory management to free up space . instead, consider the 64gb version . the jump from 16gb to 64gb is so big that i think most people don’t really need to consider the 128gb version . what about an android phone . one of the phones i carry around is a samsung galaxy s5 . its 5 . 1” screen makes it a direct competitor to the iphone 6’s 4 . 7” . first off, if you have $100’s worth of iphone apps and movies, own an apple tv, ipad and other apple products then there’s a big financial incentive to stay . if that’s the case then you should stay put . however, if you’re like me, and just like iphones but nothing else that apple offers then check out android . spec-for-spec, they’re quite close . i guess you could say that the samsung galaxy s5’s 5 . 1” 1920x1080 display has a lot more resolution than the 6’s 1344x750 but to be honest, in everyday usage, the difference is minimal . camera-wise they’re also close . i’d say the 6 is better in this regard but the s5 camera is also outstanding . the s5 pulls ahead with a louder earpiece and speakerphone . as far as lte bands go the 6 has more but again, the difference to most users is minimal . you do get more storage options with the 6 but then again, you can add memory cards to the s5 . memory cards are a much cheaper way to add storage . i will say though that the flash memory used in memory cards is usually much lower quality than what you’ll find inside a phone . memory cards are usually slower and less durable so while it’s cheaper, in a way you’re getting less . hardware-wise, they’re so close it really boils down to an ios vs android thing . android is now a really mature ecosystem and you just might like it . android also offers more freedom . you can root your phone and install apps that google doesn’t want you to install . it’s also easier to get media onto an android phone . one other thing to think about is that there are many lower cost options on android . be it a nexus 5 with a 5” screen for ~$350 (screen isn’t as nice, camera is terrible), or a $420 oneplus (much bigger, hardware isn’t as nice but it’s close enough), or a used android flagship (used htc one m8 for $425 anyone?) . is paying that much more for an iphone 6 worth it . since the original iphone came out, they’ve all been about the same width . that is till now; the lineup has bifurcated into 2 new iphones; the 4 . 7” iphone 6 and the 5 . 5” iphone plus which are both significantly larger than their predecessor the 5s . while over the past few years, android oem’s have been gradually increasing the size of their phones, apple just took a huge jump increasing the screen size a not insignificant 0 . 7” on the iphone 6 and a massive 1 . 5” on the iphone plus . so let’s take a look at the plus model first . should i keep my iphone 5s . the most obvious difference is the size; the 5s has a tiny 4” screen while the 6 plus’ 5 . 5” screen is almost double the size . the extra size completely changes how you use and carry the plus around with you . there’s a reason why apple also offers the 6 which has a medium sized 4 . 7” screen . other than the size, the plus is a slightly improved version of the 5s . it’s a little bit faster, the camera is a little bit better, the speakers are a little louder, that sort of thing . however, there’s only one feature which is a big improvement . i’m talking about the battery which is almost double the size of the 5s . and in case you’re wondering, the double sized screen is more than mitigated by the double sized battery . you also get nfc but it isn’t that useful here in canada yet since apple pay isn't available here yet . the other big difference is that the plus is available with up to 128gb of storage which is nice if you take a lot of pictures or download a lot of movies . what about the iphone 6 . if you’re thinking of getting the 6 plus, then you’re probably considering the 6 also . the 6 has less battery life than the plus but more than the 5s . the 6’s screen is also less sharp at 326ppi vs 401ppi but to be honest, i don’t think many users will notice this unless they look really closely . you also lose optical image stabilization which is a shame . other than those points, the 6, with it’s 4 . 7” screen is a much more pocket friendly phone . it also doesn’t hurt that the 6 is $100 cheaper than the plus . what size do i need . the plus is available in 16, 64 and 128gb sizes . the difference between each is $100 - so the cost per gigabyte drops dramatically if you choose to jump up a size . then again, the 6 plus starts off at $859 cad unlocked so you’re already spending a lot to start . to me, the 64gb unit is the sweet spot . 16gb only gives you about 14 . 7gb to play with . the problem, is that when apple releases new versions of ios, sometimes it requires a lot of free space . for example, on my 5s, the upgrade from ios 7 to ios 8 required over 5gb of free space on my device . so, in order to install it i needed to delete a bunch of apps . if you opt for the 128gb version i don’t doubt that you’ll fill it up eventually but chances are, all you have to do is exercise a tiny bit of discipline when it comes to managing your content to be satisfied with 64gb . if i may segue for a moment; the $249 ipod classic with it’s 160gb hard drive is no longer available . i guess it’s been replaced with the 128gb iphone 6 and 6 plus which have almost the same capacity . of course, now instead of spending $249 you have to spend an arm and 2 legs . what about an android phone . if you’re hooked on ios and locked into the apple eco-system then sorry my friend, you’re stuck . still, if you’re willing to try something new, you can get a brand new one plus one with 64gb of storage for just under $500 canadian including all taxes and shipping . and come october, you won’t need to beg them for an invite to purchase one . spec for spec, it’s similar to the plus . 5 . 5” 1920x1080 display? check . the plus comes with a 8mp camera while the opo’s has 13mp .  . 64gb of storage costs just under $500 with the opo vs over $1000 for the 64gb plus . while the plus’s screen is much better than the opo, and the camera is no match for the plus’ camera and you forgo the convenience of the fingerprint reader, is the plus really worth paying more than double? it’s not that the opo comes with bad hardware, it’s more a case of the opo coming with better hardware while the plus has the best . let’s not forget that the opo doesn’t bend as easily as the plus does . even if you love iphones, the $600 gap really provides a lot of incentive to at least see if you like android + having $600 to spend on other stuff enough to forgo the plus . the under $200 prepaid market in canada has been heating up . between the moto g, zte grand x and now the alcatel onetouch pop icon we’ve got some really great choices . the pop icon is available from telus for $200 on a plan or $130 pre-paid with a $10 credit while on koodo prepaid you pay $200 and get a $20 credit . if you’re getting one, i recommend picking it up on telus prepaid . what about the zte grand x . in the canadian market, the pop icon’s closest competitor is probably the zte grand x . spec for spec, they’re almost identical . the biggest difference, other than the fact that the zte is only available from bell while the alcatel is from telus, is that the grand x has a higher resolution 1280x720 display while the pop’s is only 960x540 . on the other hand, the pop comes with android 4 . 4 . 2 while the zte only comes with last year’s 4 . 3 . while both have similar specs, the pop is also noticeably shorter and a tiny bit narrower which makes it a little easier to use . the clincher is that the pop comes with a 2 year warranty . what about motorola moto g . first off, motorola recently announced an update to the moto g called the moto g . yup, they kept the same name . anyways, the moto g i’m talking about here is the original one that only has hspa, 8gb of storage and no microsd .  . that moto g has 4 things going for it over the pop . first off, it has a faster processor and secondly, motorola has been very good about keeping it on the very latest version of android - even 0 . 0 . x type updates . there are very few companies that are this pedantic about updates . it also has a higher resolution screen and 8gb of built-in storage vs 4gb on the pop . otherwise, the pop has a bigger display which i’d argue is more useful than having a higher resolution display plus it has a slightly better camera, a microsd slot and a 2 year warranty . i think more people will prefer the pop just because it has a bigger display . body: . the only complaints i have about the body are that the seams in the corner don’t install confidence .  . i also wish that the part of battery cover near the usb connector wasn’t so thin - i wonder whether it might crack if you use that part to peel the cover off . there’s also a gap around the screen where it meets the body - this is also typical for this class of phone . if you have a lot of lint in your pocket you may find that dust gets trapped in this gap . still, overall, build quality is good . it’s similar to other ~$150 phones like the zte grand x and motorola moto g . the paint job also feels fine .  . right: power and volume buttons . left: nothing to see . top: headphone jack . bottom: microusb . removable battery, microsim and microsd . display: . you get a 960x540, 5” ips lcd display . these days, even phones that cost around the $100 mark have decent displays and the icon is no different . the first thing that i noticed is that the pop’s display is matte! you can’t really tell from the pictures but it’s not reflective like pretty much every other phone . indoors, it’s wonderful because it reflects glare . the problem is that the display pretty much disappears when you try to use it outdoors in bright sunlight . viewing angles are reasonable as is the amount of colour/contrast shift off angle . the screen coatings are decent too .  . there are a few other areas where the icon’s display needs work . first off, while it’s quite large at 5” (the size is roughly the same class as many android flagships), it’s stretched a bit thin when it comes to resolution . 1280x720 on a 5” display looks fantastic while 960x540 can look a little rough at times . text can sometimes look a little jagged - it’s especially noticeable when you’re zoomed out of a web page . the other problem is when the screen is mostly white (like when you’re looking at many webpages) . when you do this you can see the screen back light on the sides if you’re looking at screen off-center . normally i wouldn’t care about this but it’s very noticeable once you move about 20 degrees off-center which isn’t typical of most phones . while checking out the display i found one more small problem, the display actually has a dent on it . i doubt most users would even notice it but if you ever try to put a screen protector on the pop you’ll find that it will show up as a bubble . camera: . the pop is a $150 phone and for that price, you get a camera that’s pretty typical of this class of phone . you might get some good pictures outdoors in the bright sunlight but indoors you’ll have to manage your expectations . video doesn't look very good . the microphone actually records decent audi but the problem is that it picks up a lot of handling noise . i could be wrong but i didn't notice an option for the pop to save photos on a microsd .
