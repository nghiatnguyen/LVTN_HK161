I am very pleased with <0,-1,2 the phone> we received.  <1,0,2 It> is <2,0,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <3,0,2 this> for <4,0,1 my wife>, she took <5,0,2 it> to <6,0,1 the ATT store> where <7,0,1 they> plugged in <8,0,1 a sim card> and set <9,0,2 it> up within 5 minutes.  <10,0,1 No problems> at all.  <11,0,2 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <12,0,1 our tile floor>. I even like some of <13,-1,0 the displays> better than <14,-1,0 my S4> <15,14,2 which> is probably associated with <16,-1,0 the S3 operating system>.  <17,-1,0 The price> was in <18,0,1 line> with <19,0,1 other sellers>. <20,0,2 The phone> is shipped right away. I had read a number of <21,0,1 reviews> on <22,0,2 this product> advertised elsewhere on <23,0,1 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <24,-1,0 a clone> or refurbished <25,-1,0 phone> as described by <26,0,1 some other buyers>.  However, I think that <27,0,1 reviews> may get bundled under <28,0,1 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure <29,25,1 what> is being advertised for <30,0,1 sale> by <31,0,1 the specific seller>.  <32,0,1 This ad> was for <33,0,0 a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone> and <34,0,2 that> is exactly <35,0,2 what> we received.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,2 one> of <2,0,1 the best phones> I've ever used. I absolutely love <3,0,2 the phone> and <4,-1,0 the photo quality> <5,0,2 it> has.
I've had <0,-1,0 my N8100> for about two years.  Dropped <1,0,2 it> on <2,0,1 pavement>, <3,0,1 concrete>, <4,0,1 wood floors>, etc. at least 30 times so <5,0,2 it> has a ton of <6,0,1 scratches> but <7,0,2 it>'s held up very well.  <8,0,0 My 2-year old> has chewed on <9,0,2 it>, licked <10,0,2 it>, smacked <11,0,2 it>, <12,0,1 etc.> -- still <13,0,1 no problems>.  <14,-1,0 Signal> has been solid, <15,-1,0 intuitive usability> is very good.  <16,-1,0 My standard battery> was great for the first 20 months (several hours of <17,-1,0 talk time>, a week of <18,-1,0 standby>) and just now is needing <19,0,1 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <20,0,0 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,-1,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <1,0,1 Sprint> for about 14 months.  After <2,0,2 my phone> got to be about a year old, <3,0,2 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <4,0,1 much care> on <5,0,2 my part>. I have not dropped <6,0,2 the phone> or done <7,0,1 anything> else to warrant <8,0,1 all the damage>.  <9,0,1 The hinge> to flip open <10,0,2 the phone> has completely broken, <11,0,1 first just one side> broke and pretty soon <12,0,1 the entire thing> broke.  Then just <13,0,1 yesterday> <14,-1,0 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <15,0,1 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <16,0,1 a new phone> for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get <17,0,2 a new phone> <18,0,2 that> will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <19,0,2 This> is <20,0,2 the first phone> I've had <21,0,2 that> has been so cheaply made.
I know <0,-1,2 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,0,0 this Sanyo 8100> is <2,0,2 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <3,0,1 my adult life>. From day <4,0,1 one> I had <5,0,1 problems> with <6,-1,0 reception>, with <7,-1,0 the volume> and with <8,-1,0 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <9,0,2 It> only got worse over time. <10,-1,0 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <11,0,1 sunlight or even interior light> brighter than <12,0,1 a 60-watt bulb>. <13,-1,0 The photos> are awful. I've had <14,0,2 the phone> barely a year and <15,0,2 it> has essentially stopped working now. <16,0,1 It>'ll be a cold day in <17,0,1 hell> before I give <18,0,1 Sony Ericsson> <19,0,1 any more> of <20,0,1 my money>.
<0,-1,0 This Sanyo 8100> is <1,0,2 an excellent phone>.  <2,0,2 It> has <3,-1,0 a very good color screen>, <4,0,2 it> is well designed, <5,-1,0 the camera> is pretty good for <6,0,1 a phone>, and <7,0,2 it> has <8,0,1 numerous features>.  For <9,0,1 example>, if you have <10,0,1 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <11,0,1 an IR sensor>, you can transfer <12,-1,0 phone numbers>, <13,-1,0 to-do items>, and <14,0,1 more>.  You can also record <15,0,1 sound>, apply <16,0,1 themes> to <17,-1,0 your background>, and <18,0,1 surf> <19,0,1 the web>.  <20,0,2 The phone> has a very nicely laid out <21,-1,0 case> and <22,-1,0 menu> <23,23,2 that> is easy to navigate.  <24,0,2 It> also has <25,-1,0 a very quality feel> when you hold <26,0,2 it> in <27,0,1 your hand>.  <28,0,1 The only very minor problem> with <29,0,2 this phone> is that <30,22,2 the case> smudges easily.  <31,0,1 Sony> includes <32,-1,0 a nice cloth> to wipe <33,0,2 it> down with.  Besides <34,0,1 that>, <35,0,2 this phone> is incredible.  I got <36,0,1 two> of <37,0,1 them> under <38,0,1 a family plan> with <39,0,1 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <40,-1,0 The price> is ok, so I would give <41,0,2 this phone> <42,0,1 a 5> out of <43,0,1 5>.
<0,-1,0 The E105> looks amazing, and works even better. <1,0,1 What> I like most about <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,1 the ease> of <4,0,1 use>. I do not have the time to tinker with <5,0,1 a gadget> for an hour to find out how <6,0,1 a particular thing works>. With <7,0,2 this phone>, <8,0,1 it> is really easy to browse through <9,-1,0 the menu> and find out <10,0,1 what> I am looking for. <11,-1,0 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <12,11,2 your PDA> strictly for <13,0,1 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <14,12,2 it> as <15,0,2 the phone> keeps <16,0,1 track> of <17,-1,0 all your appointments and phonebook> just fine. <18,-1,0 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also works fine and if <19,0,2 the device> is on, <20,0,1 any call> is transferred to <21,18,2 the headset> automatically. Overall, <22,0,2 the phone> is <23,0,2 a good purchase> but I am <24,0,1 a little skeptical> about <25,0,1 AT&T service>. From <26,0,1 what> I have seen, <27,-1,0 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <28,0,1 the customer service> for <29,0,1 any reason>, expect to be on <30,0,1 hold> for a long time - about 10-20 minutes).
Previous to purchasing <0,-1,0 the E105> I was <1,-1,0 an S105 owner>.  I loved <2,1,2 that phone>, but I had <3,0,1 my pet> peeves about <4,1,2 it>, <5,-1,0 the keys> being connected on <6,-1,0 the keypad> made <7,1,2 it> difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving <8,0,1 this> wasn't really <9,0,1 an issue>.  Yes <10,0,1 it> was hard to see <11,-1,0 the screen> in <12,0,1 daylight> but I don't expect to see <13,-1,0 a crystal clear picture> on <14,0,1 a cell phone>, <15,0,1 they> aren't <16,0,1 mini laptops folks>.  Although <17,0,1 it> was hard to read, <18,0,1 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately, I went to <19,0,0 a concert> and lost that <20,1,2 phone> and replaced <21,1,2 it> with <22,0,0 the E105>.  I have <23,0,1 no complaints>, I live in <24,0,1 a basement apartment> and <25,1,0 the S105> wouldn't get <26,0,1 service>, but <27,0,0 the E105> gets <28,0,1 one bar> and picks up <29,0,1 all my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <30,0,1 the caller> on <31,0,1 the other line> perfectly, <32,0,1 my boyfriend> has <33,0,1 one> as well and I can hear <34,0,1 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <35,0,1 a room> with <36,0,1 mild background noise>.  I haven't had <37,0,1 any problems> with <38,-1,0 the screen> going black, only when <39,0,2 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <40,0,1 option> from <41,-1,0 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <42,0,0 this phone> up to <43,0,1 date>, we'll see if <44,0,0 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,1 love> with <1,-1,0 this E105> because <2,1,2 it> was compact and lightweight.  <3,0,1 That>'s about <4,0,1 all> I love about <5,1,2 the phone> right now.  <6,1,2 It> has really <7,-1,0 bad reception>, not to mention <8,-1,0 weird background noises> on <9,-1,0 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,0,1 T-Mobile> sent <11,0,1 a replacement> after I told <12,0,1 them> of <13,0,1 the problem>, but <14,0,1 it>'s still <15,0,1 the same>.  I would buy <16,0,1 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,1 the money>.  <18,-1,0 The wallpapers> provided are not <19,0,1 the best>, and <20,0,0 neither> are <21,-1,0 the ringtones>.  Sometimes there is <22,0,1 a delay> for <23,-1,0 the screen> to show up when you flip for opening <24,1,2 the phone>. <25,1,2 The phone> is <26,1,2 a nice organizer> though.  <27,-1,0 Alarms> are loud as well as <28,-1,0 the ringtones>.  <29,23,2 Screen> is pretty bright.  <30,-1,0 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <31,0,1 That>'s about <32,0,1 all the good features> of <33,1,2 the phone>.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy <34,1,2 this phone>.
I've had <0,-1,0 the E105> for about 2 weeks now and I must say <1,0,2 it>'s <2,0,1 one> of <3,-1,0 the best phones> I've owned.  <4,0,1 The included ringers> are truly embarrassing to play in public, but <5,-1,0 it>'s easy to download <6,-1,0 new and free ringtones> with <7,-1,0 the free WAP access> <8,7,2 that> <9,0,1 T-Mobile> includes. <10,-1,0 The rings> are very loud though, and <11,-1,0 the sound quality> is superb... <12,-1,0 my ringer> is currently <13,0,1 a song> with <14,-1,0 the voice> and <15,0,1 all>! <16,-1,0 The sound quality> is great, but I guess <17,16,2 that> depends on <18,0,1 your location and service> in <19,0,1 your area>.  <20,0,1 T-Mobile> includes <21,7,2 free basic WAP> browsing <22,7,2 which> I use every day on <23,0,2 this phone>, and for the people <24,0,1 who> can't access <25,0,1 their favorites> in <26,0,1 T-Zones>... <27,0,1 all> you have to do is hold down <28,-1,0 the pound button> and <29,0,1 your favorites> will pop up. <30,-1,0 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <31,0,0 a call>, playing <32,-1,0 games>, or browsing <33,-1,0 the web>.  Overall <34,0,2 this> is <35,0,2 an excellent phone>. The people <36,0,1 who> complain about <37,0,2 this phone> really need to do <38,0,1 their research> before <39,0,1 they> blab. I downloaded <40,-1,0 new games>, <41,-1,0 backgrounds>, and <42,-1,0 ringtones> for free.
I just received <0,-1,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm <1,0,1 more> than impressed.  <2,0,2 It> is much smaller than <3,0,2 it> looks in <4,0,1 the pics> and has <5,0,1 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <6,0,1 a flip phone> and doing <7,0,1 extensive damage>.... <8,0,1 nothing> to worry about with <9,0,2 this baby>.  <10,-1,0 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  There aren't <11,0,1 the best song selections> for <12,-1,0 ringtones>, but <13,-1,0 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <14,0,1 a phone> with <15,-1,0 good reception>, <16,-1,0 a stylish look>, and <17,-1,0 a colorful screen>, <18,0,2 this> is <19,0,2 the one> for you. <20,0,2 It> doesn't have tons of <21,0,1 features> like some of <22,0,1 the other Samsung models>, but <23,0,1 who> uses <24,0,1 all that crap> anyway.  I'm very satisfied!
<0,-1,0 The E105> is <1,0,2 a great phone>, I used <2,0,2 it> with <3,0,1 my Cingular sim> and had <4,0,1 no problem> with <5,0,2 it>. I switched to <6,0,1 a prepaid plan> and <7,0,2 it> works great. <8,-1,0 The camera> is better than <9,0,1 some phones> I have seen. <10,-1,0 The 64MB memory stick> is good for <11,-1,0 pics> and <12,-1,0 music>. <13,0,1 The bad> is you can't get <14,0,2 it> from <15,0,1 any carrier> in <16,0,1 the states>, <17,0,1 only online>.
After <0,-1,0 my Motorola V180> had acted up on me and frozen all the damn time, I had to get <1,-1,0 a new one> and <2,1,2 the Samsung X495> doesn't disappoint. <3,0,1 The only bad thing> about <4,1,2 this phone> is that I can't access <5,-1,0 the internet>. <6,-1,0 Reception> is great, and <7,-1,0 the battery life> is long - <8,1,2 it> charges in two hours <9,0,1 which> is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have <10,6,2 excellent reception>. <11,-1,0 The speaker phone> is superb, not loud, <12,11,2 it> is so clear, but you have to use <13,11,2 it> with <14,1,2 the phone> open. <15,1,2 It> is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. <16,1,2 It>'s <17,1,2 the perfect girl phone>. If you are looking for <18,0,1 a basic phone> <19,0,1 that> actually works, <20,1,2 this> is <21,1,2 the phone> you have been waiting for!
I got <0,-1,0 this Samsung X495> because <1,-1,0 the price> was great, and <2,0,2 it> was easy to hold in <3,0,1 my hand>. <4,0,2 This> is <5,0,2 my first cellphone>, and I love <6,0,2 it>! I'd recommend <7,0,2 it> to anyone! <8,0,2 A must-have> for everyone <9,0,1 who> is getting <10,0,1 their first cellphone>. <11,0,1 Easy> to use, but you have to read <12,0,1 the instruction manual> first to learn about <13,0,1 all> of <14,0,1 its features>. <15,-1,0 Nice and bright screen> with <16,-1,0 a nice loud ringtone>. I hope you choose <17,0,2 this phone> if you're unsure of <18,0,1 which> <19,0,1 Verizon Wireless cell phone> to buy.
I am totally in <0,0,1 love> with <1,-1,0 this Motorola V300>. <2,1,2 This> is <3,1,2 the first phone> <4,1,2 that> I could use without worrying if <5,-1,0 the signal> is going to drop. <6,1,2 It> is so much more reliable and lighter than <7,-1,0 Z500>. You plus <8,1,2 it> when you change <9,-1,0 faceplates>, you don't have to worry about <10,9,2 all the dust and faceplate> slipping off. Sure <11,1,2 it> has <12,-1,0 a very sensitive camera button> but I find <13,0,1 it> entertaining to see <14,0,1 what pictures> I have taken by <15,0,1 accident>. <16,0,1 That>'s just me but oh well. You can't have <17,0,1 your cake> and eat <18,0,1 it> too.
I really like <0,-1,0 this V300>.  <1,0,2 It>'s cute, <2,0,2 it>'s little, <3,0,2 it>'s perfect for <4,0,1 a young woman>.  I had <5,-1,0 a Pocket PC> prior to <6,0,2 this> and <7,0,1 it> was so complicated just making <8,0,1 a call>.  I wanted <9,0,1 something> simple, <10,0,2 that> wasn't a mp3 player (i have <11,-1,0 an iPod>), <12,0,2 that> wasn't a professional camera (i have <13,0,1 a nice digital cam>), or a PDA (i have <14,-1,0 a PALM TX>) … <15,0,2 it>'s just simple and cute. <16,0,2 It>'s Bluetooth compatible... <17,0,1 although> doesn't work <18,0,1 that great> with <19,-1,0 my Bluetooth>, but I'm not sure if <20,21,2 it>'s <21,-1,0 the headset> or <22,0,2 the phone>. <23,-1,0 The ringer> on <24,0,2 it> is <25,0,1 super quiet>... almost to <26,0,1 the point> you can barely hear <27,23,2 it> in <28,0,1 your purse>.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for <29,-1,1 the vibrating feature> instead. I like how you can put <30,0,1 a person><31,0,1 's picture> next to <32,0,1 their name> in <33,-1,0 your contact list>. I can wear <34,0,2 it> in <35,0,1 the back pocket> of <36,0,1 my jeans> and <37,0,1 it>'s comfortable. <38,-1,0 Sound quality> is good, on <39,0,1 both ends> I dig <40,0,2 it>.  I'm sure you will too.
<0,0,1 ok>, I have had <1,-1,0 Verizon> for less than two years and <2,-1,0 this V300> is <3,2,2 my third phone>.  <4,2,1 It> is fairly new so I have <5,-1,0 no complaints> as of yet.  <6,-1,0 The reception> is a lot clearer than <7,0,1 the last one> I had.  <8,0,1 The fact> that <9,2,2 it> has <10,-1,0 a camera> is even greater.  I love taking <11,-1,0 pictures> so <12,2,2 this> was perfect for me.  <13,-1,0 The picture quality> isn't <14,0,1 the best>, but for <15,2,2 a camera phone> <16,13,2 it> is pretty good compared to <17,0,1 the others> I have seen. <18,-1,0 The buttons> of <19,2,2 the phone> are larger than some so I don't have <20,0,1 trouble> hitting <21,-1,0 the wrong buttons>.  I haven't had <22,0,1 any difficulty> with <23,-1,0 the battery> at all, in <24,0,1 fact> <25,23,2 the battery> seems to last quite a bit longer than <26,0,1 the last two phones> I had.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with <27,2,2 this phone>.
I got <0,-1,0 my V300> a few days ago and <1,0,2 it> is way better than <2,0,1 the other one> I had.  I do have to say that <3,0,1 the features> are awesome!  <4,0,1 They> are easier to use than <5,0,1 my old phone>. <6,-1,0 The camera> is easy as <7,0,1 pie> to use.  <8,0,2 It> has a lot of <9,-1,0 memory>. On <10,-1,0 the screen> you can put <11,0,1 pictures> that you take with <12,-1,0 the camera option>. Or you can download <13,0,1 wallpapers> for <14,-1,0 your background>.  <15,0,2 It> is <16,0,2 such a nice phone>. You can store a lot of <17,0,1 contacts> in <18,-1,0 the contacts list>. Basically I would recommend <19,0,2 this phone> for anyone.
I upgraded <0,2,2 my phone> two months ago from <1,-1,0 a Motorola V300> to <2,-1,0 this Nokia 6101> because I wanted <3,-1,0 a radio> and <4,-1,0 a larger keypad>. After one month, <5,3,2 the radio> no longer worked, <6,-1,0 the battery> dies when <7,2,2 it> claims to be fully charged, <8,0,1 it> takes <9,0,1 three> tries to get <10,2,2 it> to connect when making <11,0,1 a call>, and sometimes <12,2,2 the phone> <13,0,1 just freaks> out and resets <14,2,2 itself> while you're in <15,0,1 the middle> of <16,0,1 texting> or surfing <17,0,1 the web>. <18,2,2 It>'s flimsy. I've had <19,1,0 my V300> for two years and <20,0,1 everything> still works on <21,1,2 it>. <22,2,2 The Nokia 6101> has a lot of <23,0,1 issues>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the Nokia 6101> since <1,0,1 late October 2005>. I absolutely love <2,0,2 it>! I wouldn't trade <3,0,2 it> for <4,0,1 the world>. <5,0,1 My boyfriend> even wanted me to trade <6,0,2 it> to get <7,-1,0 a Motorola Razr V3> like he has, <8,7,2 which> does have <9,0,1 its own set> of <10,0,1 great perks>, but I love <11,0,2 my phone>. There are <12,-1,0 a few games> on there, <13,-1,0 the camera quality> has <14,0,1 great clarity>, <15,-1,0 the FM radio> works perfectly, and <16,15,2 it> has <17,-1,0 great reception> on <18,-1,0 T-Mobile><19,-1,0 's GSM network>. You can also use <20,-1,0 the recorder> to record <21,0,1 your own ringtones>. <22,0,2 It>'s great!
I recently purchased <0,-1,0 this N6101> and <1,0,2 it> is so much better than <2,0,1 the last one> I had! <3,0,1 The only problem> I've had so far is that <4,0,2 it> froze up once <5,0,1 which> can be fixed only by putting <6,-1,0 the battery> back in.
<0,-1,0 This N6101> is awesome and has <1,0,1 great features>! I have had <2,0,2 it> for a year and <3,0,2 it> hasn't given me <4,0,1 a problem> once! <5,-1,0 The ringtones> are awesome! <6,-1,0 The camera quality> is great and <7,-1,0 it> has <8,-1,0 cool games> <9,8,2 that> are <10,0,2 fun> that you can order. <11,0,1 This phone> really lets you show <12,0,1 your style> with <13,0,1 features> <14,0,1 that> let you pick <15,0,1 your phone colors> and <16,0,1 online shopping> for <17,5,2 ringtones> and <18,-1,0 wallpaper>! <19,0,2 It> lets you adjust <20,-1,0 the phone volume> and <21,-1,0 ringtone volume> to <22,0,1 your liking> and <23,0,1 the T-zones online shop> has <24,0,1 all the best artists and songs> <25,0,1 that> gets <26,0,1 everyone dancing>, like <27,0,1 Rihanna>, <28,0,1 Chamillionare> and a lot more! So, if you want <29,0,1 a reliable phone> <30,0,1 that> lets you personalize and just be you, with <31,0,1 so many cheap plans> to choose from, then you should get <32,0,2 the Nokia 6101 Phone (which> is <33,-1,0 T-Mobile> of <34,0,1 course>!) because <35,0,1 it> 's the <36,0,2 best!>
<0,-1,0 This Nokia 6101> is excellent.  <1,0,2 The best> I've had as far as <2,-1,0 reliability and signal> - may be partly because of <3,-1,0 Cingular>, too.  <4,-1,0 The buttons> are a little hard to get used to, but <5,0,1 it> doesn't take long.  <6,-1,0 The screen> is clear and easy to read, <7,-1,0 the battery> stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use <8,0,2 it> to call anyone), and <9,0,2 it>'s <10,0,2 just an overall good phone>.  I totally recommend <11,0,2 it>.
