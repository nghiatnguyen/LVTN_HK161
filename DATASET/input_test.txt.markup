I am very pleased with <0,-1,2 the phone> we received.  <1,0,2 It> is <2,0,0 a genuine Samsung S3>.  I purchased <3,0,2 this> for <4,0,1 my wife>, she took <5,0,2 it> to <6,0,1 the ATT store> where <7,0,1 they> plugged in <8,0,1 a sim card> and set <9,0,2 it> up within 5 minutes.  <10,0,1 No problems> at all.  <11,0,2 It> has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on <12,0,1 our tile floor>. I even like some of <13,-1,0 the displays> better than <14,-1,0 my S4> <15,14,2 which> is probably associated with <16,-1,3 the S3 operating system>.  <17,-1,3 The price> was in <18,0,1 line> with <19,0,1 other sellers>. <20,0,2 The phone> is shipped right away. I had read a number of <21,0,1 reviews> on <22,0,2 this product> advertised elsewhere on <23,0,1 Amazon> and was concerned about receiving <24,-1,1 a clone> or refurbished <25,-1,1 phone> as described by <26,0,1 some other buyers>.  However, I think that <27,0,1 reviews> may get bundled under <28,0,1 specific product names> so I suggest you just be sure <29,25,1 what> is being advertised for <30,0,1 sale> by <31,0,1 the specific seller>.  <32,0,1 This ad> was for <33,0,0 a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone> and <34,0,2 that> is exactly <35,0,2 what> we received.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S3> is <1,0,2 one> of <2,0,1 the best phones> I've ever used. I absolutely love <3,0,2 the phone> and <4,-1,3 the photo quality> <5,0,2 it> has.
I've had <0,-1,0 my N8100> for about two years.  Dropped <1,0,2 it> on <2,0,1 pavement>, <3,0,1 concrete>, <4,0,1 wood floors>, etc. at least 30 times so <5,0,2 it> has a ton of <6,0,1 scratches> but <7,0,2 it>'s held up very well.  <8,0,2 My 2-year old> has chewed on <9,0,2 it>, licked <10,0,2 it>, smacked <11,0,2 it>, <12,0,1 etc.> -- still <13,0,1 no problems>.  <14,-1,3 Signal> has been solid, <15,-1,3 intuitive usability> is very good.  <16,-1,3 My standard battery> was great for the first 20 months (several hours of <17,-1,3 talk time>, a week of <18,-1,3 standby>) and just now is needing <19,0,1 a charge> every other day. I'll definitely buy <20,0,2 a Sanyo> again.
I have had <0,-1,0 the Sanyo 8100 phone> from <1,0,1 Sprint> for about 14 months.  After <2,0,2 my phone> got to be about a year old, <3,0,2 it>'s been slowly breaking despite <4,0,1 much care> on <5,0,2 my part>. I have not dropped <6,0,2 the phone> or done <7,0,1 anything> else to warrant <8,0,1 all the damage>.  <9,0,1 The hinge> to flip open <10,0,2 the phone> has completely broken, <11,0,1 first just one side> broke and pretty soon <12,0,1 the entire thing> broke.  Then just <13,0,1 yesterday> <14,-1,3 the display> completely stopped working as well.  According to <15,0,1 Sprint>, I am not eligible for <16,0,1 a new phone> for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get <17,0,2 a new phone> <18,0,2 that> will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  <19,0,2 This> is <20,0,2 the first phone> I've had <21,0,2 that> has been so cheaply made.
I know <0,-1,2 it> sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think <1,0,0 this Sanyo 8100> is <2,0,2 the worst purchase> I have ever made in <3,0,1 my adult life>. From day <4,0,1 one> I had <5,0,1 problems> with <6,-1,3 reception>, with <7,-1,3 the volume> and with <8,-1,3 a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message>. <9,0,2 It> only got worse over time. <10,-1,3 The display> is essentially impossible to read in <11,0,1 sunlight or even interior light> brighter than <12,0,1 a 60-watt bulb>. <13,-1,3 The photos> are awful. I've had <14,0,2 the phone> barely a year and <15,0,2 it> has essentially stopped working now. <16,0,1 It>'ll be a cold day in <17,0,1 hell> before I give <18,0,1 Sony Ericsson> <19,0,1 any more> of <20,0,1 my money>.
<0,-1,0 This Sanyo 8100> is <1,0,2 an excellent phone>.  <2,0,2 It> has <3,-1,3 a very good color screen>, <4,0,2 it> is well designed, <5,-1,3 the camera> is pretty good for <6,0,1 a phone>, and <7,0,2 it> has <8,0,1 numerous features>.  For <9,0,1 example>, if you have <10,0,1 a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC> with <11,0,1 an IR sensor>, you can transfer <12,-1,3 phone numbers>, <13,-1,3 to-do items>, and <14,0,1 more>.  You can also record <15,0,1 sound>, apply <16,0,1 themes> to <17,-1,3 your background>, and <18,0,1 surf> <19,0,1 the web>.  <20,0,2 The phone> has a very nicely laid out <21,-1,3 case> and <22,-1,3 menu> <23,6,2 that> is easy to navigate.  <24,0,2 It> also has <25,-1,0 a very quality feel> when you hold <26,0,2 it> in <27,0,1 your hand>.  <28,0,1 The only very minor problem> with <29,0,2 this phone> is that <30,22,2 the case> smudges easily.  <31,0,1 Sony> includes <32,-1,3 a nice cloth> to wipe <33,0,2 it> down with.  Besides <34,0,1 that>, <35,0,2 this phone> is incredible.  I got <36,0,1 two> of <37,0,1 them> under <38,0,1 a family plan> with <39,0,1 ATT> and have not been disappointed.  <40,-1,3 The price> is ok, so I would give <41,0,2 this phone> <42,0,1 a 5> out of <43,0,1 5>.
<0,-1,0 The E105> looks amazing, and works even better. <1,0,1 What> I like most about <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,1 the ease> of <4,0,1 use>. I do not have the time to tinker with <5,0,1 a gadget> for an hour to find out how <6,0,1 a particular thing works>. With <7,0,2 this phone>, <8,0,1 it> is really easy to browse through <9,-1,3 the menu> and find out <10,0,1 what> I am looking for. <11,-1,3 The PDA feature> is also great. If you use <12,11,2 your PDA> strictly for <13,0,1 business purposes>, now you can easily do without <14,1,2 it> as <15,0,2 the phone> keeps <16,0,1 track> of <17,-1,3 all your appointments and phonebook> just fine. <18,-1,3 The Bluetooth headset> I installed also works fine and if <19,0,2 the device> is on, <20,0,1 any call> is transferred to <21,18,2 the headset> automatically. Overall, <22,0,2 the phone> is <23,0,2 a good purchase> but I am <24,0,1 a little skeptical> about <25,0,1 AT&T service>. From <26,0,1 what> I have seen, <27,-1,3 the coverage> seems pretty limited (and if you call <28,0,1 the customer service> for <29,0,1 any reason>, expect to be on <30,0,1 hold> for a long time - about 10-20 minutes).
Previous to purchasing <0,-1,0 the E105> I was <1,-1,0 an S105 owner>.  I loved <2,1,2 that phone>, but I had <3,0,1 my pet> peeves about <4,1,2 it>, <5,-1,3 the keys> being connected on <6,-1,3 the keypad> made <7,1,2 it> difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving <8,0,1 this> wasn't really <9,0,1 an issue>.  Yes <10,0,1 it> was hard to see <11,-1,0 the screen> in <12,0,1 daylight> but I don't expect to see <13,-1,3 a crystal clear picture> on <14,0,1 a cell phone>, <15,0,1 they> aren't <16,0,1 mini laptops folks>.  Although <17,0,1 it> was hard to read, <18,0,1 it> wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately, I went to <19,3,1 a concert> and lost that <20,1,2 phone> and replaced <21,1,2 it> with <22,0,0 the E105>.  I have <23,0,1 no complaints>, I live in <24,0,1 a basement apartment> and <25,1,0 the S105> wouldn't get <26,0,1 service>, but <27,0,0 the E105> gets <28,0,1 one bar> and picks up <29,0,1 all my calls crystal> clear.  I can hear <30,0,1 the caller> on <31,0,1 the other line> perfectly, <32,0,1 my boyfriend> has <33,0,1 one> as well and I can hear <34,0,1 the whole conversation> if I am sitting next to him in <35,0,1 a room> with <36,0,1 mild background noise>.  I haven't had <37,0,1 any problems> with <38,-1,3 the screen> going black, only when <39,0,2 the phone> goes idle but you can change that <40,0,1 option> from <41,-1,3 the menu>.  Overall I am pleased with <42,0,2 this phone> up to <43,0,1 date>, we'll see if <44,0,2 it> holds up.
I first fell in <0,0,1 love> with <1,-1,0 this E105> because <2,1,2 it> was compact and lightweight.  <3,0,1 That>'s about <4,0,1 all> I love about <5,1,2 the phone> right now.  <6,1,2 It> has really <7,-1,3 bad reception>, not to mention <8,-1,3 weird background noises> on <9,-1,3 both incoming/outgoing calls>.  <10,0,1 T-Mobile> sent <11,0,1 a replacement> after I told <12,0,1 them> of <13,0,1 the problem>, but <14,0,1 it>'s still <15,0,1 the same>.  I would buy <16,0,1 another phone> right now if I had <17,0,1 the money>.  <18,-1,3 The wallpapers> provided are not <19,0,1 the best>, and <20,0,1 neither> are <21,-1,3 the ringtones>.  Sometimes there is <22,0,1 a delay> for <23,-1,3 the screen> to show up when you flip for opening <24,1,2 the phone>. <25,1,2 The phone> is <26,1,2 a nice organizer> though.  <27,-1,3 Alarms> are loud as well as <28,-1,3 the ringtones>.  <29,23,3 Screen> is pretty bright.  <30,-1,3 Buttons> are nice and crisp.  <31,0,1 That>'s about <32,0,1 all the good features> of <33,1,2 the phone>.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy <34,1,2 this phone>.
I've had <0,-1,0 the E105> for about 2 weeks now and I must say <1,0,2 it> is <2,0,2 one> of <3,-1,1 the best phones> I've owned.  <4,0,3 The included ringers> are truly embarrassing to play in public, but <5,-1,1 it>'s easy to download <6,-1,3 new and free ringtones> with <7,-1,3 the free WAP access> <8,7,2 that> <9,0,1 T-Mobile> includes. <10,-1,3 The rings> are very loud though, and <11,-1,3 the sound quality> is superb... <12,-1,3 my ringer> is currently <13,0,1 a song> with <14,-1,3 the voice> and <15,0,1 all>! <16,-1,3 The sound quality> is great, but I guess <17,16,2 that> depends on <18,0,1 your location and service> in <19,0,1 your area>.  <20,0,1 T-Mobile> includes <21,7,2 free basic WAP> browsing <22,7,2 which> I use every day on <23,0,2 this phone>, and for the people <24,0,1 who> can't access <25,0,1 their favorites> in <26,0,1 T-Zones>... <27,0,1 all> you have to do is hold down <28,-1,3 the pound button> and <29,0,1 your favorites> will pop up. <30,-1,3 The battery life> is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making <31,0,3 a call>, playing <32,-1,3 games>, or browsing <33,-1,3 the web>.  Overall <34,0,2 this> is <35,0,2 an excellent phone>. The people <36,0,1 who> complain about <37,0,2 this phone> really need to do <38,0,1 their research> before <39,0,1 they> blab. I downloaded <40,-1,3 new games>, <41,-1,3 backgrounds>, and <42,-1,3 ringtones> for free.
I just received <0,-1,0 my E105> the other day and I must say that I'm <1,0,1 more> than impressed.  <2,0,2 It> is much smaller than <3,0,2 it> looks in <4,0,1 the pics> and has <5,0,1 steel casing>.  I was always worried about dropping <6,0,1 a flip phone> and doing <7,0,1 extensive damage>.... <8,0,1 nothing> to worry about with <9,0,2 this baby>.  <10,-1,3 The 65,000 color LCD> is bright and clear!  There aren't <11,0,1 the best song selections> for <12,-1,3 ringtones>, but <13,-1,3 the polyphonic sound> is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for <14,0,1 a phone> with <15,-1,3 good reception>, <16,-1,3 a stylish look>, and <17,-1,3 a colorful screen>, <18,0,2 this> is <19,0,2 the one> for you. <20,0,2 It> doesn't have tons of <21,0,1 features> like some of <22,0,1 the other Samsung models>, but <23,0,1 who> uses <24,0,1 all that crap> anyway.  I'm very satisfied!
<0,-1,0 The E105> is <1,0,2 a great phone>, I used <2,0,2 it> with <3,0,1 my Cingular sim> and had <4,0,1 no problem> with <5,0,2 it>. I switched to <6,0,1 a prepaid plan> and <7,0,2 it> works great. <8,-1,3 The camera> is better than <9,0,1 some phones> I have seen. <10,-1,3 The 64MB memory stick> is good for <11,-1,3 pics> and <12,-1,3 music>. <13,0,1 The bad> is you can't get <14,0,2 it> from <15,0,1 any carrier> in <16,0,1 the states>, <17,0,1 only online>.
After <0,-1,0 my Motorola V180> had acted up on me and frozen all the damn time, I had to get <1,-1,2 a new one> and <2,1,0 the Samsung X495> doesn't disappoint. <3,0,1 The only bad thing> about <4,1,2 this phone> is that I can't access <5,-1,3 the internet>. <6,-1,3 Reception> is great, and <7,-1,3 the battery life> is long - <8,1,2 it> charges in two hours <9,0,1 which> is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have <10,6,2 excellent reception>. <11,-1,3 The speaker phone> is superb, not loud, <12,11,2 it> is so clear, but you have to use <13,11,2 it> with <14,1,2 the phone> open. <15,1,2 It> is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. <16,1,2 It> is <17,1,2 the perfect girl phone>. If you are looking for <18,0,1 a basic phone> <19,0,1 that> actually works, <20,1,2 this> is <21,1,2 the phone> you have been waiting for!
I got <0,-1,0 this Samsung X495> because <1,-1,3 the price> was great, and <2,0,2 it> was easy to hold in <3,0,1 my hand>. <4,0,2 This> is <5,0,2 my first cellphone>, and I love <6,0,2 it>! I'd recommend <7,0,2 it> to anyone! <8,0,2 A must-have> for everyone <9,0,1 who> is getting <10,0,1 their first cellphone>. <11,0,1 Easy> to use, but you have to read <12,0,1 the instruction manual> first to learn about <13,0,1 all> of <14,0,1 its features>. <15,-1,3 Nice and bright screen> with <16,-1,3 a nice loud ringtone>. I hope you choose <17,0,2 this phone> if you're unsure of <18,0,1 which> <19,0,1 Verizon Wireless cell phone> to buy.
I am totally in <0,0,1 love> with <1,-1,0 this Motorola V300>. <2,1,2 This> is <3,1,2 the first phone> <4,1,2 that> I could use without worrying if <5,-1,3 the signal> is going to drop. <6,1,2 It> is so much more reliable and lighter than <7,-1,0 Z500>. You plus <8,1,2 it> when you change <9,-1,3 faceplates>, you don't have to worry about <10,9,2 all the dust and faceplate> slipping off. Sure <11,1,2 it> has <12,-1,3 a very sensitive camera button> but I find <13,0,1 it> entertaining to see <14,0,1 what pictures> I have taken by <15,0,1 accident>. <16,0,1 That>'s just me but oh well. You can't have <17,0,1 your cake> and eat <18,1,2 it> too.
I really like <0,-1,0 this V300>.  <1,0,2 It> is cute, <2,0,2 it> is little, <3,0,2 it>'s perfect for <4,0,1 a young woman>.  I had <5,-1,0 a Pocket PC> prior to <6,0,2 this> and <7,0,1 it> was so complicated just making <8,0,1 a call>.  I wanted <9,0,1 something> simple, <10,0,2 that> wasn't a mp3 player (i have <11,-1,0 an iPod>), <12,0,2 that> wasn't a professional camera (i have <13,0,1 a nice digital cam>), or a PDA (i have <14,-1,0 a PALM TX>) … <15,0,2 it>'s just simple and cute. <16,0,2 It>'s Bluetooth compatible... <17,0,1 although> doesn't work <18,0,1 that great> with <19,-1,3 my Bluetooth>, but I'm not sure if <20,4,2 it>'s <21,-1,3 the headset> or <22,0,2 the phone>. <23,-1,3 The ringer> on <24,0,2 it> is <25,0,1 super quiet>... almost to <26,0,1 the point> you can barely hear <27,23,2 it> in <28,0,1 your purse>.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for <29,-1,1 the vibrating feature> instead. I like how you can put <30,0,1 a person><31,0,1 's picture> next to <32,0,1 their name> in <33,-1,3 your contact list>. I can wear <34,0,2 it> in <35,0,1 the back pocket> of <36,0,1 my jeans> and <37,0,1 it>'s comfortable. <38,-1,3 Sound quality> is good, on <39,0,1 both ends> I dig <40,0,2 it>.  I'm sure you will too.
<0,0,1 ok>, I have had <1,-1,0 Verizon> for less than two years and <2,-1,0 this V300> is <3,2,2 my third phone>.  <4,2,1 It> is fairly new so I have <5,-1,1 no complaints> as of yet.  <6,-1,3 The reception> is a lot clearer than <7,0,1 the last one> I had.  <8,0,1 The fact> that <9,2,2 it> has <10,-1,3 a camera> is even greater.  I love taking <11,-1,3 pictures> so <12,2,2 this> was perfect for me.  <13,-1,3 The picture quality> isn't <14,0,1 the best>, but for <15,2,2 a camera phone> <16,13,2 it> is pretty good compared to <17,0,1 the others> I have seen. <18,-1,3 The buttons> of <19,2,2 the phone> are larger than some so I don't have <20,0,1 trouble> hitting <21,-1,3 the wrong buttons>.  I haven't had <22,0,1 any difficulty> with <23,-1,3 the battery> at all, in <24,0,1 fact> <25,23,2 the battery> seems to last quite a bit longer than <26,0,1 the last two phones> I had.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with <27,2,2 this phone>.
I got <0,-1,0 my V300> a few days ago and <1,0,2 it> is way better than <2,0,1 the other one> I had.  I do have to say that <3,0,1 the features> are awesome!  <4,0,1 They> are easier to use than <5,0,1 my old phone>. <6,-1,3 The camera> is easy as <7,0,1 pie> to use.  <8,0,2 It> has a lot of <9,-1,3 memory>. On <10,-1,3 the screen> you can put <11,0,1 pictures> that you take with <12,-1,3 the camera option>. Or you can download <13,0,1 wallpapers> for <14,-1,3 your background>.  <15,0,2 It> is <16,0,2 such a nice phone>. You can store a lot of <17,0,1 contacts> in <18,-1,3 the contacts list>. Basically I would recommend <19,0,2 this phone> for anyone.
I upgraded <0,-1,2 my phone> two months ago from <1,-1,0 a Motorola V300> to <2,-1,0 this Nokia 6101> because I wanted <3,-1,3 a radio> and <4,-1,3 a larger keypad>. After one month, <5,3,2 the radio> no longer worked, <6,-1,3 the battery> dies when <7,2,2 it> claims to be fully charged, <8,0,1 it> takes <9,0,1 three> tries to get <10,2,2 it> to connect when making <11,0,1 a call>, and sometimes <12,2,2 the phone> <13,0,1 just freaks> out and resets <14,2,2 itself> while you're in <15,0,1 the middle> of <16,0,1 texting> or surfing <17,0,1 the web>. <18,2,2 It>'s flimsy. I've had <19,1,0 my V300> for two years and <20,0,1 everything> still works on <21,1,2 it>. <22,2,0 The Nokia 6101> has a lot of <23,0,1 issues>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the Nokia 6101> since <1,0,1 late October 2005>. I absolutely love <2,0,2 it>! I wouldn't trade <3,0,2 it> for <4,0,1 the world>. <5,0,1 My boyfriend> even wanted me to trade <6,0,2 it> to get <7,-1,0 a Motorola Razr V3> like he has, <8,7,2 which> does have <9,0,1 its own set> of <10,0,1 great perks>, but I love <11,0,2 my phone>. There are <12,-1,3 a few games> on there, <13,-1,3 the camera quality> has <14,0,1 great clarity>, <15,-1,3 the FM radio> works perfectly, and <16,15,2 it> has <17,-1,3 great reception> on <18,-1,1 T-Mobile><19,-1,1 's GSM network>. You can also use <20,-1,3 the recorder> to record <21,0,1 your own ringtones>. <22,0,2 It>'s great!
I recently purchased <0,-1,0 this N6101> and <1,0,2 it> is so much better than <2,0,1 the last one> I had! <3,0,1 The only problem> I've had so far is that <4,0,2 it> froze up once <5,0,1 which> can be fixed only by putting <6,-1,3 the battery> back in.
<0,-1,0 This N6101> is awesome and has <1,0,1 great features>! I have had <2,0,2 it> for a year and <3,0,2 it> hasn't given me <4,0,1 a problem> once! <5,-1,3 The ringtones> are awesome! <6,-1,3 The camera quality> is great and <7,-1,2 it> has <8,-1,3 cool games> <9,8,2 that> are <10,0,2 fun> that you can order. <11,0,1 This phone> really lets you show <12,0,1 your style> with <13,0,1 features> <14,0,1 that> let you pick <15,0,1 your phone colors> and <16,0,1 online shopping> for <17,5,2 ringtones> and <18,-1,3 wallpaper>! <19,0,2 It> lets you adjust <20,-1,3 the phone volume> and <21,-1,3 ringtone volume> to <22,0,1 your liking> and <23,0,1 the T-zones online shop> has <24,0,1 all the best artists and songs> <25,0,1 that> gets <26,0,1 everyone dancing>, like <27,0,1 Rihanna>, <28,0,1 Chamillionare> and a lot more! So, if you want <29,0,1 a reliable phone> <30,0,1 that> lets you personalize and just be you, with <31,0,1 so many cheap plans> to choose from, then you should get <32,0,0 the Nokia 6101 Phone (which> is <33,-1,1 T-Mobile> of <34,0,1 course>!) because <35,0,1 it> is the <36,0,2 best!>
<0,-1,0 This Nokia 6101> is excellent.  <1,0,2 The best> I've had as far as <2,-1,3 reliability and signal> - may be partly because of <3,-1,1 Cingular>, too.  <4,-1,3 The buttons> are a little hard to get used to, but <5,0,1 it> doesn't take long.  <6,-1,3 The screen> is clear and easy to read, <7,-1,3 the battery> stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use <8,0,2 it> to call anyone), and <9,0,2 it> is <10,0,2 just an overall good phone>.  I totally recommend <11,0,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The Y210> is <1,0,2 a 78-dollar phone>. <2,0,2 It> is <3,0,2 the cheapest Android phone> you can buy. <4,-1,3 The plastic screen> shows a lot of <5,-1,3 reflections> and gets oily very easily. I haven't had <6,-1,1 a chance> to use <7,0,2 it> under <8,6,1 direct sunlight> yet. You won't confuse <9,0,2 it> with <10,-1,0 the HTC One>'s <11,-1,3 display> but <12,0,2 it>'s actually not <13,-1,3 a bad display>. <14,-1,3 The plastic> on <15,-1,3 the back> is hard and unpainted. <16,0,2 It> reminds me of <17,6,1 the dash> on <18,6,1 my car>. Still, overall <19,0,0 the Y210> doesn't feel cheap. <20,0,2 It> doesn't creak or shift much when you squeeze <21,0,2 it>. <22,-1,2 One refreshing thing> about <23,0,0 the Huawei Ascend Y210> is that <24,22,3 its small size> makes <25,0,0 it> very easy to use with <26,6,1 just one hand>.
Besides <0,-1,3 the super high resolution>, <1,-1,3 the GS4 display> is simply better than <2,-1,0 the GS3> when <3,1,2 it> comes to <4,-1,1 colour> and <5,-1,3 more importantly outdoor performance>. <6,-1,0 The GS4><7,1,3 's display> is much easier to live with. While <8,-1,3 its colour> is still slightly cool, <9,8,2 it>'s much more normal looking, <10,4,1 which> will make <11,1,2 it> much easier to live with. <12,5,3 Outdoor performance> is <13,5,2 a quantum leap> forward over <14,2,0 the GS3>. <15,6,0 The GS4>'s <16,-1,3 screen> works much better than <17,2,0 GS3>'. <18,6,2 It> is good enough although <19,6,2 it> not as good as <20,-1,0 the iPhone 5> or <21,-1,0 HTC> <22,0,0 One display> in <23,4,1 this sense>. Under <24,4,1 the sun>, you don't really lose <25,4,1 any functionality>. I'd say <26,6,0 the GS4>'s is <27,1,3 the best Super AMOLED display> yet. <28,1,2 It> is <29,1,2 the best one> since <30,-1,0 the Galaxy S2>'s.
Again, you can see <0,-1,1 what> <1,0,1 a difference> <2,0,1 the change> in <3,-1,3 resolution> makes with <4,-1,0 the Rugby>. Even though <5,-1,0 the DEFY> has <6,-1,3 a lower resolution screen>, <7,-1,3 its GPU> is much weaker than <8,-1,2 the one> in <9,-1,0 the GS3> and <10,4,0 Rugby>. I still need to run <11,0,1 my battery benchmarks> but <12,4,0 the Rugby> has <13,-1,3 a relatively large 1850mAh battery> and <14,-1,3 a sort-of-small 4” display> so <15,4,2 it> should be able to make <16,4,2 it> through the day. <17,-1,3 Sound quality> is good. <18,17,2 It> sounds clean and natural. <19,-1,3 Maximum earpiece volume> is just slightly lower than <20,-1,0 my iPhone 5> so <21,19,2 it>'s good in <22,0,1 this regard>. <23,-1,3 The speaker> is very loud. You'll never miss <24,0,1 any calls> (unless you turn <25,4,2 it> off).
<0,-1,0 The Rugby LTE> is <1,0,2 a really niche product> <2,0,2 that> doesn't have <3,-1,1 any competitors>. While <4,0,2 it> lacks <5,-1,3 the bling> of <6,-1,0 the GS3>, <7,0,2 it>'s fast. <8,-1,3 The screen> isn't huge but I don't think <9,8,2 it>'s too small. <10,0,2 It> is <11,0,2 a good compromise> since <12,8,3 a bigger screen> might make <13,0,0 the Rugby> too big. As for <14,-1,3 the price>, <15,3,1 it>'s a little harder to say. Since <16,0,0 the Rugby> is <17,0,2 such a niche product>, there isn't much to compare <18,14,2 its price> with. You can say that <19,-1,0 a Nexus 4> is <20,19,2 a better deal> but once you dunk <21,19,0 a Nexus 4> in <22,3,1 water> or drop <23,19,2 it> on <24,3,1 concrete>, <25,19,2 it>'ll probably be worth <26,3,1 far less> than <27,0,0 the Rugby>. After <28,3,1 all>, <29,0,0 the Rugby> is more powerful than <30,-1,0 the DEFY PRO and Xperia> Go. <31,0,2 It> should be priced higher than <32,3,1 them>, right?
<0,-1,0 The X Plus> have <1,-1,3 beats logos> on <2,0,2 it>. However, <3,-1,1 HTC> has clearly done <4,3,1 some work> on <5,0,0 the X Plus> in <6,3,1 the headphone department>. <7,0,0 The X Plus>'s <8,-1,3 headphone> is much louder than <9,-1,0 the X.> <10,8,2 It>'s clearly louder than <11,9,0 the X> although <12,8,0 it> is not as loud as <13,-1,0 the 8X> I just reviewed. <14,8,0 It>'s loud enough that you might need to get <15,3,1 new headphones> if you want to your listen to <16,3,1 music> at <17,3,1 maximum volume>.
<0,-1,0 The One X Plus> has <1,-1,3 64GB storage> but, since <2,-1,0 the GS3> has <3,-1,3 a microSD card slot>, <4,-1,1 it>'s easy to add <5,-1,3 a 64GB card> to <6,2,2 it>. Where <7,-1,2 the shines> of <8,0,0 the One X Plus> is <9,7,3 its display>. <10,0,2 It> just beats <11,2,0 the GS3> at <12,4,1 pretty much everything> except for <13,-1,3 black levels>. <14,0,2 It>'s better in <15,4,1 the sun>, <16,0,2 it>'s brighter and <17,0,2 it>'s <18,4,1 less grainy>. <19,2,0 The GS3>'s <20,4,1 strength> is <21,-1,3 its software>. While <22,-1,3 Touchwiz> isn't perfect, <23,22,2 it> feels more advanced than <24,-1,3 Sense>. <25,0,2 It> also has <26,4,1 2GB> of <27,-1,3 RAM> <28,27,2 which> makes <29,4,1 a huge difference> when <30,0,2 it> comes to multitasking.
<0,-1,3 The 8X camera> focuses slightly faster than <1,-1,0 the Lumia 920>'s. If you look closely at <2,-1,0 the 8X>'s <3,-1,3 pictures>, <4,0,3 the 8X camera> captures <5,-1,1 more detail> than <6,1,0 the 920>. So, given <7,5,1 ideal conditions>, <8,0,3 it> can take <9,3,3 decent pictures>. <10,-1,3 Maximum earpiece volume> is decent though <11,10,2 it>'s not as loud as <12,-1,0 my iPhone 5>. <13,-1,3 Sound quality> is good. <14,13,2 It>'s clean-sounding with <15,5,1 little hiss>. <16,-1,3 The built-in speaker> sounds fine but <17,16,2 it>'s not very loud.
I tried <0,-1,0 this SE> out <1,-1,1 today> and I think <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,2 a great phone>. <4,0,2 It>'s fast like <5,-1,0 my IPhone 6s> but smaller, I liked <6,-1,0 the IPhone 5s size>. I had <7,6,0 the IPhone 5s> and loved <8,6,2 it> but then updated to <9,0,0 the IPhone 6a>. <10,0,0 The SE> looks just like <11,6,0 the IPhone 5s> but with <12,-1,3 more speed>. <13,-1,3 The camera> is like <14,0,0 my IPhone 6s>. So if you want to go back to having <15,0,2 a phone> <16,0,2 that> fits in <17,1,1 your pocket>, <18,0,2 this> is <19,0,2 the one>!
I love <0,-1,0 my Note 3>, <1,0,2 it>'s bigger than <2,-1,0 my S3> but <3,0,2 it>'s not as big as <4,2,2 the mega phone> but <5,0,2 it>'s just right for me, I haven't learned <6,-1,1 everything> about <7,0,2 the phone> but I do love <8,-1,3 the pen> <9,8,2 that> comes with <10,0,2 the phone>, <11,8,2 it> does a lot. <12,-1,3 The camera> is nice and much clearer.
<0,-1,0 The Note 3> is a lot bigger than <1,-1,0 my HTC EVO> but somehow <2,0,0 it>'s lighter. <3,0,0 It>'s very fast and has <4,-1,1 so many features> that <5,-1,0 an IPhone5> can't touch. I love <6,-1,3 the camera features> and <7,6,2 it> takes <8,-1,3 great pictures>. <9,0,2 This> is <10,0,2 the best smart phone> on <11,4,1 the market>.
Bought <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> during black Friday to replace <1,-1,0 my aging S4>. <2,-1,1 Everything> about <3,0,2 it> is better than <4,1,0 the S4> except <5,-1,3 video recording>. <6,0,0 The Nexus 6> has <7,-1,3 a horrible video camera>. <8,7,0 It> cannot focus on moving <9,2,1 objects>. I like to take <10,-1,3 videos> for <11,2,1 Instagram> and <12,0,2 this phone> is <13,2,1 absolute trash> when <14,0,2 it> comes to <15,10,3 videos>. <16,0,2 It> constantly tries to focus and <17,2,1 this> leads to <18,10,3 blurry videos>. Besides <19,10,3 the video problem>, <20,0,2 the phone> is great. <21,0,2 The phone> has <22,-1,3 longer battery life> than <23,1,2 the S4> and also much faster.
I was a bit worried that <0,-1,2 the phone> would be too big. Honestly, <1,0,0 The Nexus 6> is a bit bigger than <2,-1,1 most phones> but I can tell you that within 5 minutes I got <3,2,1 use> to <4,-1,3 the size> and I absolutely love <5,0,2 my phone>. <6,-1,3 The screen> is big enough for <7,2,1 everything> and <8,-1,3 the speakers> are awesome. I am happy I made <9,2,1 the decision> to get <10,0,2 this> instead of <11,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. I don't think I need <12,11,2 a phone> smaller than <13,0,0 the Nexus 6> right now.
Honestly, I love <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> but sometimes <1,-1,3 the speaker volume> is very low even when <2,1,2 it>'s turned up. <3,-1,1 It> happens even when I am in <4,3,1 a very quiet place>. Also <5,-1,3 my battery> does not last for 24 hours, <6,5,2 it> last for about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, <7,5,2 it> charges super fast, takes <8,-1,3 great pictures> and <9,3,1 overall> is very fast.
I got <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> for <1,-1,1 my mom> and <2,0,0 it>'s really awesome. <3,-1,3 The display quality> is great. <4,-1,3 The screen size> is big. <5,-1,3 The battery life> is very good. <6,-1,3 No bloatware>--<7,1,1 just Android> in <8,1,1 its pure form>. <9,-1,3 HD Audio> Calling on <10,1,1 T-Mobile> works like <11,1,1 a charm>. <12,-1,3 Front> facing <13,-1,3 camera quality> could be better but at <14,1,1 this price point> <15,13,2 it>'s very acceptable. <16,-1,3 Rear facing images> are good but not great when compared to <17,1,1 leading flagships phones>. Most people will be very satisfied with <18,-1,3 the image quality>. I give <19,0,2 it> <20,1,1 an 7.5> per <21,1,1 10> compared to <22,-1,0 an IPhone 6S>.
I've been using <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6> for about 4 weeks and I have to write to say that I love <1,0,2 this phone> completely. <2,0,2 It> is big and I love <3,-1,3 the front facing stereo speakers>. <4,0,0 This Nexus 6> beats <5,-1,0 the S4 hands> down, of <6,-1,1 course>, and <7,0,0 the Nexus 6> is better than <8,-1,0 the OnePlus One>. I'm pleased with <9,0,2 this phone>.
I don't even know where to start, I love <0,-1,1 everything> about <1,-1,0 this Nexus 6>. <2,1,2 It> makes <3,-1,0 my old Samsung galaxy S4 look> and feel like <4,3,2 a joke>. <5,-1,3 Excellent battery life>, and I mean excellent. <6,-1,3 Beautiful screen>. <7,-1,3 Quality dual speakers>. <8,-1,3 Impressive camera>. Honestly, <9,-1,0 the Nexus 6P> is worse than <10,1,0 the Nexus 6>. I use <11,9,2 this phone>, and I couldn't be happier.
I love <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6>! I got <1,0,2 it> a few weeks ago. <2,0,0 The Nexus 6> is so much better than <3,-1,0 my Galaxy S4>. <4,0,2 It> runs <5,-1,3 Android> very smoothly and <6,-1,3 the screen size> is amazing. I had to get used to <7,0,0 the Nexus 6> but having <8,-1,3 a 6 inch screen> makes <9,0,2 it> so much easier to <10,-1,1 type emails> and see <11,10,1 apps>. I am very glad I got <12,0,2 this phone> and would recommend <13,0,2 it> to anyone <14,10,1 who> is looking and trying to figure out <15,10,1 what kind> of <16,10,1 phone> <17,10,1 they> want. I also love how fast <18,10,1 the charging> is with <19,-1,3 the charger>. <20,0,2 The phone> can be very low on <21,-1,3 battery> and charge up to <22,10,1 full> in less than 2 hours. So far, <23,0,2 it> is <24,0,2 an amazing phone>!
<0,-1,0 Nexus 6> is awesome, but <1,-1,1 the reason> for <2,1,1 the 4 stars> is that there is <3,-1,3 no Wifi> calling, <4,3,2 which> is <5,3,2 a feature> <6,3,2 that> is available if purchased through <7,1,1 TMobile>. Where we live, <8,3,2 it>'s almost essential, so not having that <9,3,2 feature> meant a lot to us. If <10,3,2 that>'s not important, <11,0,2 it> is <12,0,2 a wonderful phone>. <13,-1,3 Screen> is crystal clear and <14,-1,3 the calls> of <15,0,0 Nexus 6> are a lot crisper than <16,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. <17,0,2 Great phone>!
I purchased <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> after having <1,-1,1 continued issues> with <2,-1,0 my Samsung Note>. <3,2,0 My Note> had reached <4,1,1 its limit>. I've been using <5,0,0 the Nexus 6> for about three days. <6,0,2 It> is <7,1,1 lightning> fast compared to <8,2,0 the Note>. <9,0,0 The Nexus 6> is a little faster than <10,-1,0 the Blackberry Passport> I use for <11,1,1 work>. <12,0,2 It> really works well <13,1,1 the streaming data>. And <14,0,0 the Nexus 6> makes <15,-1,3 calls> and picks up <16,-1,3 signal> better than <17,2,0 the Note>. <18,0,2 It> holds <19,-1,3 a charge> well, but I do find myself charging when I get home from <20,1,1 work>. But with <21,-1,3 the super fast charging>, <22,0,2 it> is really <23,0,2 no big deal>. <24,-1,3 The camera> is decent enough. <25,-1,3 Pictures> are decent but <26,-1,3 the interface> is <27,26,2 a little clunky>. In general, I really love <28,0,2 this device>.
<0,-1,3 A 4.5" display> sounds nice on <1,-1,1 paper> but for me <2,0,2 it>'s too big. <3,1,1 The problem> is, that I prefer to use <4,-1,2 my phone> with <5,1,1 one hand>. <6,1,1 It> is <7,1,1 one> of <8,1,1 the reasons> why I like to use <9,-1,0 an iPhone>. <10,4,0 The Raider>'s <11,-1,3 display> is so large that <12,1,1 my thumb> can't reach <13,1,1 parts> of <14,-1,3 the screen> when I'm using <15,4,2 it> with <16,1,1 one hand>. While I think that <17,14,3 the screen> is too big I must say <18,14,2 it> looks fantastic. <19,14,2 It> has <20,-1,3 great viewing angles>, <21,14,2 it>'s bright, very sharp, has <22,1,1 great contrast> with pleasing <23,-1,3 colours> and <24,14,2 it> works outdoors. Interestingly, <25,14,2 it> doesn't <26,1,1 photograph> very well so don't judge <27,-1,3 the screen quality> from <28,-1,3 my pictures>. <29,1,1 One thing> I hate about <30,-1,0 HTC Android phones> is that <31,30,2 they> place <32,-1,3 the buttons> too close to <33,-1,3 the edges>. <34,1,1 This> makes <35,32,2 them> more difficult to use because I'm always pressing <36,32,2 them> accidentally. Unfortunately, <37,4,0 the Raider> has <38,1,1 this problem> too. <39,-1,3 The front facing camera> has <40,-1,3 a resolution> of <41,40,2 1.3MP>. <42,39,2 It> can capture <43,-1,3 both still photos and video> - neither of <44,43,2 which> are very good. While <45,4,0 the Raider> seemed unappealing at first, <46,4,2 it> really grew on me. In <47,1,1 the end>, I can say that between <48,-1,3 its fast performance>, <49,-1,3 LTE>, <50,-1,3 great camera and software>, <51,4,0 the HTC Raider> is <52,4,2 a solid performer>. <53,4,2 It> is <54,4,2 a HTC device> <55,4,2 that> I love to use.
I recently reviewed <0,-1,0 the LG Optimus 3D>. <1,0,0 The Optimus> has <2,-1,3 a 3D display> <3,2,3 that> doesn't require <4,-1,1 glasses> plus <5,0,2 it> had <6,-1,3 dual cameras> to capture <7,-1,3 3D images>. Now I have <8,-1,0 the HTC EVO 3D>. I like how <9,8,0 the EVO> is a little thicker than <10,-1,0 the HTC Sensation 4G>. <11,8,2 It> makes <12,8,2 it> easier to use. Still, I found myself accidentally pressing <13,-1,3 the menu buttons> a lot <14,13,2 them> a lot - especially when whenever I tried to use <15,8,0 the EVO> with <16,4,1 one hand>. <17,-1,3 The display> has <18,-1,3 a higher resolution> than <19,-1,0 the Galaxy S2> and <20,0,0 LG Optimus 3D>. <21,4,1 That> said <22,17,3 the display> isn't very good. <23,17,2 It> doesn't have <24,-1,3 very good colour>.
<0,-1,3 The screen> is awesome with <1,-1,3 a bright and beautiful display>. <2,-1,0 The Galaxy S5> has <3,-1,1 more options> and <4,3,1 freedom> than <5,-1,0 the Iphones>. However, <6,-1,3 the Touch Wiz interface> of <7,2,2 it> is very laggy. <8,-1,3 Camera> is slow. <9,8,2 It> takes <10,3,1 way> too long to <11,3,1 load> and by the time <12,8,2 it> loads, I have missed <13,3,1 the moment> I wanted to take <14,-1,3 a picture> of. Touch <15,0,3 screen> almost too sensitive. <16,2,2 The phone> is almost a little too big for <17,3,1 my preference>. <18,3,1 It>'s hard to use <19,3,1 one handed>.
