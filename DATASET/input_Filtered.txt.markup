<0,-1,0 My Nokia 3220 phone> is <1,0,2 a huge letdown> in <2,-1,3 functionality>.  First, I bought <3,0,2 it> for <4,-1,3 the camera>.  <5,4,3 The camera> does not allow me to send <6,-1,3 pictures>.  Or <7,-1,3 my settings>, <8,7,2 that> came with <9,0,2 the phone> are not sufficient.  <10,-1,1 This> is <11,10,1 one> of <12,10,1 the best reasons> to have <13,10,1 a camera phone>. <14,-1,2 The 2nd unique feature> <15,14,2 that> I was so excited <16,10,1 about> was <17,-1,3 the FM radio function>.  <18,0,2 My phone> does not have <19,17,2 that capability> either.  Even after sending <20,10,1 one> back and receiving <21,10,1 a brand new phone (exact model> as <22,10,1 first>), <23,10,0 no FM function>.  Now I don't have <24,-1,3 options> but to contact <25,10,1 Nokia> direct, <26,10,1 which> I don't think I should have to do with <27,10,1 a brand new phone>.  So I am not impressed with <28,0,2 this model> and do not recommend <29,0,2 it>.  I was <30,10,1 a huge Nokia fan> until <31,0,0 this phone>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the N3220 phone> for about 6 months now.  I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and receive <1,-1,3 about 20 emails> a day.  <2,0,2 The phone> has <3,-1,1 a bunch> of <4,3,1 great capabilities> and is occasionally <5,0,2 a great work companion>.  <6,-1,3 The wide screen> is excellent for viewing.  <7,-1,3 The CPU functions> work <8,3,1 a little slow> <9,3,1 which> could be expected from <10,0,0 such a small package>.  <11,3,1 The frustrating part> is <12,0,2 the phone> frequently works slow as well.  About once a week <13,3,1 it> is necessary to take out <14,-1,3 the battery> and let <15,14,2 it> sit for a minute before turning <16,0,2 the phone> on.  <17,0,2 The phone> takes a couple minutes to turn on.  Overall, <18,0,2 it> seems slow and unstable <19,3,1 which> overshadows <20,3,1 all> of <21,3,1 its great features>.  Reminds me of <22,3,1 Windows 98>.
<0,-1,0 My LG C1300> is <1,0,2 a really small, clamshell phone> with <2,-1,1 a part> <3,2,1 that> looks like <4,2,1 a mirror> on <5,-1,3 top>. <6,0,2 It> includes <7,2,1 most basic features> including <8,-1,3 text messaging>, <9,-1,3 multimedia> messaging, <10,-1,3 media mall>, and <11,2,1 everything> you need to download <12,-1,3 wallpaper>, <13,-1,3 games>, <14,-1,3 ringtones>, and <15,-1,3 applications> straight from <16,2,1 Cingular>. <17,0,2 It> has <18,-1,3 an awesome battery life>, but you can't always trust <19,18,3 the battery monitor>... sometimes <20,18,2 it> will display <21,2,1 one bar> left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call <22,2,1 quality> has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have <23,-1,3 bad reception>... but <24,2,1 that> is <25,-1,3 the network>, not <26,0,2 the phone>. Overall, I love <27,0,0 my LG C1300> although now I wish I might have had <28,0,2 a camera phone>, but <29,0,2 this phone> is awesome for <30,2,1 all the features> and <31,-1,3 the minimal price> involved.
We purchased <0,-1,0 A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone> for <1,-1,1 a trip> to <2,1,1 Turkey and Greece>. <3,0,2 The phone> did not work in <4,1,1 Turkey> but <5,0,2 it> did in <6,1,1 Greece>, so I believe <7,1,1 it> was the service and not <8,0,2 the phone>. <9,1,1 My complaint> is <10,-1,3 the camera>. After documenting <11,1,1 our trip> with <12,10,3 the camera>, we now find we unable to download <13,-1,3 the pictures> without purchasing, at <14,1,1 additional cost, software and USB cable> from <15,1,1 Motorola>. Ridiculous!
<0,-1,0 The Nokia 2610> is gorgeous, and <1,-1,3 the buttons> are easy for <2,-1,1 typing> on. <3,-1,2 The only downside> of <4,0,2 this device> is <5,3,3 the Windows software>. <6,3,2 It> reminds me of <7,2,1 Windows 1998> - <8,-1,3 limited error messages> and <9,2,1 a very buggy version> of <10,2,1 Internet Explorer>.
After having had <0,-1,0 this S6> in <1,-1,1 18 months or> so, <2,1,1 my final impressions> on <3,0,2 the phone> are: <4,0,2 It>'s <5,0,2 quick, good fast processor>. <6,-1,3 Screen> is very good, better than <7,1,1 average outdoor> in <8,1,1 sun>, and shows <9,1,1 nice detail> for <10,-1,3 pictures>, <11,-1,3 videos> and <12,1,1 the such>. <13,-1,3 Phone body> is slippery. <14,0,2 It>'s not <15,0,2 a good phone> to hold in <16,1,1 your hand>. <17,-1,3 Battery life> is fair. I never felt <18,1,1 comfortable> leaving home all day without <19,1,1 a charger> handy. To me <20,1,1 this> is <21,1,1 reason> enough that I would not purchase <22,0,2 this phone> again. After nearly 18 months, <23,17,3 battery> is dead. <24,17,2 It> will not recharge. <25,1,1 Only solution> is to get <26,0,2 the phone> to <27,-1,3 service> to replace <28,17,3 the battery>. <29,1,1 It> will cost me $200 as I have <30,-1,3 phone insurance>. <31,1,1 Lesson> learned: don't ever get <32,0,2 a phone> <33,0,2 which> doesn't have <34,17,3 a rechargeable battery>, ever again.
I've not had <0,-1,0 the S6> for over a week. <1,-1,3 The screen> is fantastic. <2,-1,3 My monthly google calendar> shows up on <3,1,3 1 screen>, and <4,-1,1 it>'s easy to read <5,4,1 all the events> on <6,1,2 it>. I can actually use <7,0,2 the phone> in <8,4,1 bright sunlight>, <9,4,1 something> I haven't been able to do well with <10,4,1 prior cell phones>. There was <11,4,1 a Samsung push> update <12,4,1 which> appears to have helped <13,-1,3 the battery life>, and I for <14,4,1 that reason> have raised <15,4,1 the rating> from <16,4,1 3 to 4 stars>. <17,13,3 The battery> now lasts me all day, with <18,4,1 casual uses>. If you are <19,4,1 a heavy user>, <20,0,2 this phone> will not last you all day without <21,4,1 a re-charge> by 2 PM. <22,4,1 The good news> is that a 10-15 minutes recharge will give you <23,4,1 a 30-40% or so battery boost> and <24,0,2 the phone> can be >90% in about one hour. I still do not recommend <25,0,2 the phone> for <26,4,1 heavy app users>. You'll need to consider <27,-1,0 the Samsung note> or <28,-1,0 the Droid phones> as I can't see <29,0,0 the S6> lasting past 2 PM for <30,4,1 those individuals>.
<0,-1,2 Great phone> for <1,0,2 a great price>. <2,0,2 This phone> was almost in <3,-1,1 a new> like <4,3,1 state> when I bought <5,3,2 it> from <6,0,1 Amazon>. I love <7,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S6>, I have had <8,-1,0 the S3> for years now and just upgraded and let me tell you <9,3,1 it> is like night and day. <10,0,2 Great phone>, quick at opening <11,-1,3 emails> & <12,3,1 such>, <13,-1,3 the screen> can be seen outside in <14,3,1 the sun light>. <15,0,2 This phone> is like taking <16,3,1 a small computer> around with you all the time. I do wish <17,-1,3 the sound> was louder, even with <18,-1,3 the ring tone> set at <19,3,1 high level> I still don't hear <20,18,2 it> all the time unless I am close by. I would for <21,3,1 sure buy> <22,0,2 this product> again!
I really liked <0,-1,0 my Samsung Galaxy S4> but <1,-1,0 the S6> is better without changing <2,-1,1 things> unnecessarily. I recommend maxing out <3,-1,3 the memory> at <4,2,1 128GB> as you can't add <5,2,1 more> later. I hope <6,-1,3 the battery> holds up since <7,6,2 it> can't be changed by <8,2,1 the user>. <9,-1,3 Voice recognition> works much better on <10,1,0 the S6> than <11,0,0 the S4>. <12,-1,3 The operating system> seems much quicker and <13,2,1 less buggy> as well.
I bought <0,-1,0 my Galaxy S7 Edge> and paid <1,-1,1 full price> for <2,0,2 it> less than 7 months ago. Now <3,0,2 the phone> is presenting <4,-1,3 a hardware problem> <5,4,2 which> was already acknowledged by <6,1,1 Samsung> that <7,4,2 it> is <8,4,2 a factory problem>, <9,1,1 what means>, <10,1,1 they> know <11,4,2 it> is <12,4,2 their problem> and that <13,1,1 they> are supposed to get <14,4,2 it> fixed or exchanged. However, because <15,0,2 it> is <16,0,0 an "Unlocked International Version>", <17,1,1 no Samsung> authorized <18,-1,3 service> would even touch <19,0,2 the phone>. Not even if I am paying for <20,18,3 the service>. So, now I have <21,0,2 a USD 800 paper weight> worth <22,1,1 nothing> at all. I hope <23,1,1 Samsung> is reading <24,1,1 this>. I have been <25,1,1 a Samsung loyal customer> since <26,-1,0 Galaxy S2> and now I am dropping <27,1,1 this "Loyalty>" for <28,1,1 a Windows Phone> (after wasting <29,1,1 my money> with <30,1,1 a "Samsung Flagship>", <31,1,1 a Windows Phone> is <32,1,1 all> I could afford to buy). <33,1,1 Thanks Samsung>, you have made <34,1,1 an (ex) customer> really unhappy!
I purchased <0,-1,0 this S7 edge> back in March. After two months, <1,0,2 it> started showing <2,-1,3 some screen color issues> with <3,-1,1 annoying purple stripes> all over <4,-1,3 the screen> and <5,0,2 the cellphone> <6,0,2 itself> feels hot. I had to set <7,-1,3 the brightness> to <8,3,1 the maximum> to temporarily "avoid" <9,2,1 screen issues>. And <10,3,1 what>'s worse, <11,4,3 the screen> just died completely and I can't even turn off <12,0,2 this phone> since <13,4,3 the screen> is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return <14,0,2 this> failed <15,0,0 S7 edge> and get <16,3,1 my money> back and never want to buy <17,0,2 any Samsung product> again.
<0,-1,2 This> is replacing <1,-1,0 my Galaxy S4> and lives up to <2,-1,1 the hype>. <3,2,1 No problems> transferring <4,2,1 phones> with <5,2,1 Consumer Cellular>, I merely took <6,-1,3 the sim card> from <7,1,2 my S4> and put <8,6,2 it> into <9,0,0 the S7> and I was ready to go, <10,2,1 no hassle>. <11,-1,3 Battery life> seems to be much better than <12,1,0 the S4>. Plus I like <13,-1,3 the fingerprint log> in although sometimes <14,13,2 it> won't recognize well <15,2,1 which> makes <16,13,2 it> frustrating. I end up having to use <17,2,1 the draw pattern>. Overall <18,0,2 a nice phone>.
<0,-1,0 This S7> saved me two hundred dollars. I was accidentally pushed into <1,-1,1 a creek> and after taking <2,-1,3 the battery> out and drying <3,2,2 it> for a day <4,0,2 the phone> booted right up. I don't recommend <5,0,2 this> but I had taken <6,-1,3 the charging cover>, <7,6,2 which> seals <8,-1,3 the port> from <9,1,1 water>, off because <10,1,1 it> was hard to remove. The screen shift, home and back <11,1,0 buttons> feel simply awesome and are <12,1,0 a good tradeoff> for <13,1,0 the fingerprint reader>. <14,1,0 The battery life> could be better. <15,-1,3 The screen> could be superb instead of <16,1,1 just good>. But <17,1,1 that>'s <18,1,1 nitpicking>. <19,0,2 This phone> is perfect for someone <20,1,0 who> wants <21,0,2 a good, sim card accessible, removable battery phone>. Someone <22,1,1 who> doesn't want to pay top dollar for <23,0,2 the latest model>. Very happy with <24,0,2 this purchase>.
<0,-1,3 The memory space> on <1,-1,0 this S5> is not expandable; of <2,-1,1 this>, I was not aware. I am <3,2,1 an avid pic taker> and <4,2,1 this> apparently has filled up <5,-1,3 my photos>. <6,2,1 My husband> has <7,2,1 another galaxy phone> he loves. <8,2,1 His> is expandable. <9,-1,3 My camera> has never seemed as great as <10,2,1 the claims> and <11,-1,3 my microphone> is crackly if I am on <12,-1,3 speaker>, therefore I cannot use <13,11,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The IPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 a huge phone>! <2,0,2 It> can be <3,-1,1 bully> to carry, or even just using <4,0,2 it> in <5,3,1 your hand>. But there are <6,3,1 many features> to out <7,3,1 weight> <8,0,2 this>. Coming from <9,-1,0 the IPhone 5s> I still see <10,3,1 a major increase> in <11,-1,3 CPU and graphics power>. <12,-1,2 Another amazing feature> about <13,0,2 this phone> is <14,12,3 the camera>. Although <15,12,2 it> is <16,3,1 only 8 megapixels>, <17,12,2 it> still can take <18,-1,3 better pictures> than <19,3,1 most> of <20,3,1 its Android competitors>. <21,-1,3 The battery life> on <22,0,2 this phone> is amazing. I can go all day on <23,3,1 heavy use> with lots of <24,3,1 apps>, <25,3,1 web>, and <26,3,1 texting> and still end the day with <27,21,2 40% battery>. Doing <28,3,1 that> on <29,-1,0 my IPhone 5s> was impossible. I would usually have to charge in <30,3,1 the early afternoon> on days like <31,3,1 that>. Since buying <32,0,2 this> I don't feel that I need to use <33,-1,0 my iPad> as much. There are <34,-1,3 some apps> <35,34,2 that> don't work on <36,0,2 the phone> so I have to use <37,33,0 the iPad> but probably at least 75% of <38,3,1 my web> browsing and <39,3,1 amazon shopping> is done on <40,0,2 this device>.
<0,-1,0 The iPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 the best phone> on <2,-1,1 the market>. From <3,2,1 start> to finish, <4,0,2 this phone rocks> all day long. <5,-1,3 The battery life> is great, even with <6,2,1 very heavy use>. <7,-1,3 The camera> is unmatched. <8,7,2 It> may only be <9,2,0 8MP>, but <10,-1,3 the software> makes <11,2,1 a huge difference>. You've seen <12,2,1 all the reviews> on <13,0,2 the device>, so <14,2,1 what> I really want to say is that <15,0,2 it>'s really not too big for <16,2,1 daily use>. When <17,2,1 not compared side> by <18,2,1 side> to <19,2,1 another IPhone>, people constantly believe <20,0,2 it>'s <21,0,2 the smaller version>.
<0,-1,1 Love> <1,-1,0 my IPhone 6Plus>. <2,1,2 It> is a little hard to hold <3,1,2 the phone> in <4,0,0 the right angel> to hear from <5,-1,3 the earpiece> at first. I found myself using <6,-1,3 my Bluetooth> more often now than I ever have. Other than that <7,1,2 this phone> is just so beautiful. <8,-1,3 Picture quality> is great. Watching <9,-1,3 a movie> or browsing on <10,-1,3 the web>, <11,-1,3 photos> and <12,-1,3 video> are excellent. <13,0,1 No issue> with texting with <14,0,1 small hands>. <15,0,1 My daughter> has been using <16,-1,0 my iPad 2> for <17,0,1 a while> and I have <18,0,1 no need> to use <19,16,2 it> now with <20,1,2 this big screen phone>. <21,1,2 It> has <22,-1,3 a very fast processor>, <23,0,1 no regret> at all. Absolutely love <24,1,2 it>.
I can't believe <0,-1,0 this IPhone 6Plus> outperformed <1,-1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7> that <2,0,2 it> is much faster and even <3,-1,3 the camera quality> is much clearer and sharper than <4,1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7>. Even <5,-1,3 the durability> is so much better than <6,1,0 the Samsung>, not <7,-1,1 a crack or scratch>. <8,-1,3 The screen> is so much bigger and sharper than <9,1,0 the Samsung>, <10,1,0 the Samsung S7> is <11,1,2 a crappy Windows phone> and <12,0,0 the IPhone> has <13,-1,3 more apps>. Even <14,0,2 it> is thinner and lighter. Even <15,-1,3 the speaker> has more bass and much louder than <16,1,0 the Samsung S7>!
I tried <0,-1,0 this SE> out <1,-1,1 today> and I think <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,2 a great phone>. <4,0,2 It>'s fast like <5,-1,0 my IPhone 6s> but smaller, I liked <6,-1,0 the IPhone 5s size>. I had <7,6,0 the IPhone 5s> and loved <8,6,2 it> but then updated to <9,0,0 the IPhone 6a>. <10,0,0 The SE> looks just like <11,6,0 the IPhone 5s> but with <12,-1,3 more speed>. <13,-1,3 The camera> is like <14,0,0 my IPhone 6s>. So if you want to go back to having <15,0,2 a phone> <16,0,2 that> fits in <17,1,1 your pocket>, <18,0,2 this> is <19,0,2 the one>!
I love <0,-1,0 my Note 3>, <1,0,2 it>'s bigger than <2,-1,0 my S3> but <3,0,2 it>'s not as big as <4,2,2 the mega phone> but <5,0,2 it>'s just right for me, I haven't learned <6,-1,1 everything> about <7,0,2 the phone> but I do love <8,-1,3 the pen> <9,8,2 that> comes with <10,0,2 the phone>, <11,8,2 it> does a lot. <12,-1,3 The camera> is nice and much clearer.
<0,-1,0 The Note 3> is a lot bigger than <1,-1,0 my HTC EVO> but somehow <2,0,0 it>'s lighter. <3,0,0 It>'s very fast and has <4,-1,1 so many features> that <5,-1,0 an IPhone5> can't touch. I love <6,-1,3 the camera features> and <7,6,2 it> takes <8,-1,3 great pictures>. <9,0,2 This> is <10,0,2 the best smart phone> on <11,4,1 the market>.
Bought <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> during black Friday to replace <1,-1,0 my aging S4>. <2,-1,1 Everything> about <3,0,2 it> is better than <4,1,0 the S4> except <5,-1,3 video recording>. <6,0,0 The Nexus 6> has <7,-1,3 a horrible video camera>. <8,7,0 It> cannot focus on moving <9,2,1 objects>. I like to take <10,-1,3 videos> for <11,2,1 Instagram> and <12,0,2 this phone> is <13,2,1 absolute trash> when <14,0,2 it> comes to <15,10,3 videos>. <16,0,2 It> constantly tries to focus and <17,2,1 this> leads to <18,10,3 blurry videos>. Besides <19,10,3 the video problem>, <20,0,2 the phone> is great. <21,0,2 The phone> has <22,-1,3 longer battery life> than <23,1,2 the S4> and also much faster.
I was a bit worried that <0,-1,2 the phone> would be too big. Honestly, <1,0,0 The Nexus 6> is a bit bigger than <2,-1,1 most phones> but I can tell you that within 5 minutes I got <3,2,1 use> to <4,-1,3 the size> and I absolutely love <5,0,2 my phone>. <6,-1,3 The screen> is big enough for <7,2,1 everything> and <8,-1,3 the speakers> are awesome. I am happy I made <9,2,1 the decision> to get <10,0,2 this> instead of <11,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. I don't think I need <12,11,2 a phone> smaller than <13,0,0 the Nexus 6> right now.
Honestly, I love <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> but sometimes <1,-1,3 the speaker volume> is very low even when <2,1,2 it>'s turned up. <3,-1,1 It> happens even when I am in <4,3,1 a very quiet place>. Also <5,-1,3 my battery> does not last for 24 hours, <6,5,2 it> last for about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, <7,5,2 it> charges super fast, takes <8,-1,3 great pictures> and <9,3,1 overall> is very fast.
I got <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> for <1,-1,1 my mom> and <2,0,0 it>'s really awesome. <3,-1,3 The display quality> is great. <4,-1,3 The screen size> is big. <5,-1,3 The battery life> is very good. <6,-1,3 No bloatware>--<7,1,1 just Android> in <8,1,1 its pure form>. <9,-1,3 HD Audio> Calling on <10,1,1 T-Mobile> works like <11,1,1 a charm>. <12,-1,3 Front> facing <13,-1,3 camera quality> could be better but at <14,1,1 this price point> <15,13,2 it>'s very acceptable. <16,-1,3 Rear facing images> are good but not great when compared to <17,1,1 leading flagships phones>. Most people will be very satisfied with <18,-1,3 the image quality>. I give <19,0,2 it> <20,1,1 an 7.5> per <21,1,1 10> compared to <22,-1,0 an IPhone 6S>.
<0,-1,0 Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 an amazing phone> for $250. I wanted to get <2,-1,0 the Nexus 6P> but to be honest <3,0,0 the Nexus 6> still does <4,-1,1 an amazing job>. Compare to <5,-1,3 the price> of <6,2,0 the Nexus 6P>, <7,0,2 this> is <8,0,2 a better deal>. <9,-1,3 Fast charging>, <10,-1,3 wireless charging>, <11,-1,3 great speed>, <12,-1,3 amazing display>, <13,-1,3 latest OS marshmallow> <14,4,1 6.0.1> and <15,-1,3 an ok camera>, you can't go wrong with <16,0,2 this phone>. I guess <17,15,2 the biggest con> is <18,15,3 the cameras>, <19,-1,3 rear> is ok but <20,-1,3 the front> is just awful.
<0,-1,0 The Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 a great phone>, but is not for everyone. Firstly, <2,0,2 it> is huge. <3,-1,1 This> is <4,3,1 a reason> I wanted <5,0,2 it>, but can be very unwieldy for <6,3,1 most>. Secondly, <7,0,2 it> runs <8,-1,3 stock Android 6.0> <9,3,1 Marshmallow>. I enjoy <10,-1,3 the clean, simple design> <11,10,2 which> <12,3,1 Google> has created. Many would rather have <13,-1,3 the feature rich skins> <14,13,2 which> <15,3,1 non-Nexus devices ship> with. Other than <16,3,1 these possible set backs>, <17,0,0 the Nexus 6> is <18,0,2 a great flagship device>. <19,0,2 It> contains <20,3,1 all> of <21,3,1 the top specs> expected on <22,0,2 a new phone>. <23,-1,3 The build quality> was quite premium and <24,-1,3 the AMOLED screen> is <25,24,2 a joy> to use. Since <26,-1,3 the price> has been dropping recently, <27,0,2 this> is <28,0,2 an exceptional buy>. If you enjoy <29,8,1 stock Android> and <30,-1,3 ridiculous screen size>, <31,0,2 this> is <32,0,2 the phone> for you.
