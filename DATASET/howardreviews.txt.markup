When I look at <0,-1,0 the Zen phone>, <1,-1,2 the first competitor> <2,1,2 that> comes to mind is <3,1,0 the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3>. <4,1,2 It> costs <5,-1,1 about the same money>, and has <6,5,1 very similar specs>. <7,0,0 The Zen> pulls ahead with <8,-1,3 a processor> <9,8,2 that>'s about 30% faster, with <10,-1,3 dual SIMs> and <11,-1,3 a slightly better camera>. <12,-1,3 The Idol counters> with <13,-1,3 its powerful stereo speakers> <14,5,1 which> just happen to be <15,0,0 the Zen>'s <16,5,1 weakness> and <17,5,1 more durable finishes>. <18,5,1 One question mark> is how diligent <19,5,1 Asus and Alcatel> will be when <20,5,1 it> comes to <21,5,1 Android updates>. I don't have <22,5,1 any experience> with <23,0,2 Asus>, but according to <24,5,1 Wikipedia> <25,5,1 they>'ve updated many of <26,5,1 their recent phones> from <27,5,1 KitKat> to <28,5,1 Lollipop> so I give <29,5,1 them> <30,5,1 the advantage> here. Still, while <31,0,0 the Zen> will attract a lot of <32,5,1 notice> because of <33,8,3 its powerful processor> and to <34,10,2 a lesser extent>, <35,10,3 its dual SIMs>, I think <36,1,0 the Idol> is <37,1,2 a more balance package> than <38,0,0 the Zen>. <39,1,2 It> still possesses enough for most people although <40,1,2 it> lacks <41,0,0 the Zen><42,-1,3 's raw processing power>. I guess <43,5,1 it>'s more that <44,0,0 the Zen> has <45,1,0 a significant weakness> while <46,1,0 the Idol> doesn't. 
<0,-1,1 All> in <1,0,1 all>, <2,0,1 Asus> has really shaken <3,0,1 things> up with <4,-1,0 the Zenfone 2>. If <5,4,2 it> had <6,-1,3 a fancier badge> on <7,4,2 it>, <8,0,1 they> could have charged double for <9,4,2 it> - <10,4,2 it>'s <11,4,2 a phenomenal value> and is really going to make <12,0,1 things> tough for <13,0,1 other companies>. <14,4,2 It>'s not <15,-1,3 just a powerful processor> attached to <16,0,1 a mediocre phone> either. <17,-1,3 The display> is also quite good. <18,4,2 It>'s not <19,0,1 quite flagship material> but <20,4,2 it>'s easily good enough for <21,0,1 most users>. <22,4,2 It>'s as sharp as <23,0,1 a flagship and colour> is reasonable. <24,0,1 The rest> of <25,4,0 the Zen> however is a bit of <26,0,1 a compromise>. <27,-1,3 The plastic> on <28,-1,3 the back cover> is cheap and very easy to <29,0,1 damage>. Still, <30,0,1 this> is pretty minor, after <31,0,1 all>, how often do we take <32,-1,3 our SIM and MicroSD cards>? Plus you can put <33,4,3 the Zenfone 2> in <34,-1,3 a case> and suddenly <35,27,2 the cheap plastic> isn't <36,0,1 a big deal>. As for <37,-1,3 the camera>, <38,37,2 it>'s not bad but <39,37,2 it>'s not that <40,0,1 great> either, I'd say <41,37,2 it>'s <42,0,1 a good> for <43,0,1 the price point> <44,37,2 but not a great deal> like <45,15,3 the processor> is. <46,4,0 The Zenfone 2> really punishes <47,-1,0 the Moto G 2014> as far as <48,0,1 value> for <49,0,1 your money> goes and is <50,4,2 a clear leader> when <51,4,2 it> comes to <52,0,1 bang> for <53,0,1 your buck>.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy A5> was released in <1,-1,1 Canada> recently. <2,-1,2 The biggest feature> is <3,2,3 the metal frame> <4,2,2 which> makes <5,2,2 it> very solid. You get <6,2,2 a slick metal frame> with <7,-1,3 a plastic> back. <8,0,2 It>'s <9,0,2 a budget phone> with <10,-1,3 expensive clothes>. <11,-1,3 The edges> are <12,11,3 chamfered edge> like <13,-1,0 the Galaxy Alpha> or <14,-1,0 the Note 5>. I like how <15,0,1 they> ditched <16,-1,0 the Alpha><17,-1,3 's corner> bulges. While <18,1,1 it> make <19,0,0 the A5>'s <20,-1,3 body> less interesting, <21,1,1 it> makes <22,0,2 it> much more comfortable to hold. <23,-1,0 The buttons> are all quite good. <24,1,1 They> stick just enough and click nicely when you press <25,23,2 them> in. <26,23,2 They> also don't wobble when you <27,1,1 half press> <28,23,2 them>. <29,7,2 The only downside> to <30,20,3 the A5 body> is <31,7,3 the plastic> back. <32,7,2 It>'s not <33,1,1 glass> like <34,0,0 many other recent Samsung phones>. In <35,1,1 the end>, <36,0,0 the A5> is <37,0,2 an entry-level phone> with <38,20,3 the body> of <39,0,2 a flagship phone>. <40,0,2 It>'s like <41,0,0 a hotdog> served with <42,1,1 a side> of <43,1,1 caviar>, <44,1,1 an Armani blazer> with <45,1,1 a pair jeans> <46,1,1 that> have <47,1,1 a hole> in <48,1,1 the seat>. Still, if you can appreciate <49,-1,3 the exterior> and don't have <50,-1,3 great processing> needs <51,0,0 the A5> could be <52,0,2 an interesting choice>.
<0,-1,1 The fact> that <1,-1,0 the GS5> is from <2,0,1 Samsung> makes <3,0,1 it> <4,-1,0 the Z2><5,4,2 's biggest competitor>. <6,4,0 The Z2>'s <7,-1,2 strongest points> are <8,7,3 the side-mounted camera button>. <9,4,0 The Z2> has <10,-1,3 slightly louder speakers>, <11,10,3 slightly better battery life> than <12,1,0 the GS5>. <13,4,2 It> has <14,-1,3 a fingerprint reader> for <15,0,1 easier unlocking>, a better looking <16,-1,3 screen> and <17,-1,3 a removable battery>. Between <18,0,1 the two phones>, I'd pick <19,1,0 the GS5> for <20,-1,3 its brighter display> and for <21,-1,3 the ease> of <22,0,1 use> <23,14,2 the fingerprint reader> brings. <24,0,1 That> said, watch out because <25,1,0 the GS5> doesn't use <26,-1,3 on-screen menu buttons> so handling <27,1,2 it> can be tricky unless you stick <28,1,2 it> in <29,-1,3 a case>.
For <0,-1,1 slightly less money>, you can pick up <1,-1,0 the Nexus 5x>. <2,1,0 The 5x> has <3,-1,3 a flagship-ish Snapdragon 808> while <4,-1,0 the A9> makes do with <5,-1,0 a mid-range 618>. <6,-1,3 The 5x camera> also takes <7,-1,3 the best still photos> of <8,0,1 any phone> right now. <9,1,2 It> also has <10,-1,3 a slightly larger 2700mAh battery>. Otherwise, <11,4,0 the A9> has <12,-1,3 some pretty big advantages>; <13,1,2 it> has <14,-1,3 a much nicer looking AMOLED display>. <15,0,1 3GB> of <16,-1,3 RAM> is a little bit more convenient as is <17,0,1 the 32GB> of <18,-1,3 storage and MicroSD slot>. I also find <19,-1,3 the front-mounted fingerprint reader> more intuitive to use. While <20,4,0 the A9>'s <21,-1,3 camera> isn't as good as <22,1,0 the 5x>'s, <23,4,0 the HTC>'s <24,-1,3 optical image stabilization> helps <25,4,2 it> take <26,-1,3 better looking video> though <27,4,0 it>'s limited to <28,0,1 1080P> whereas <29,1,0 the 5x> goes up to <30,0,1 4K>. However, <31,1,0 the best thing> about <32,4,0 the A9> is <33,-1,3 its metal body>. <34,-1,3 The brushed metal> back feels like <35,0,1 glass> and has <36,0,1 a sense> of <37,0,1 occasion> sorely missing from <38,1,0 the 5x>.
For <0,-1,1 the same money> you can pick up <1,-1,2 one> of <2,1,2 my favorite>, <3,1,0 the Idol 3>. <4,1,0 The Idol> pulls ahead with <5,-1,3 a full HD display> while <6,-1,0 the M4>'s is <7,-1,3 a more pedestrian HD>. <8,1,0 the Idol> also has <9,-1,3 stereo speakers> <10,9,2 which> sound better and <11,-1,3 an beefy 3000mAh battery>. On <12,0,1 the other hand>, <13,6,0 the M4>'s <14,-1,3 speakers>, while not quite as good, are still pretty damn impressive in <15,0,1 their own right>. However, <16,1,0 the M4>'s <17,0,0 key advantage> is <18,1,0 it>'s water resistant. <19,0,1 That> plus <20,14,2 the speaker> make for <21,0,1 a great combination> in <22,0,1 the shower>. I'd personally pick <23,1,0 the Idol 3> but you can't go wrong with either. <24,1,0 The Idol>'s <25,-1,3 screen> looks better and is noticeably sharper but <26,6,0 the M4>'s <27,-1,3 water resistance> is <28,27,2 a very practical feature>.
<0,-1,0 The 6p> really improves on <1,-1,1 the previous one> in <2,1,1 almost all areas>. <3,-1,3 The screen resolution> is unchanged but <4,3,2 it> looks better. <5,-1,3 The speakers> are improved, <6,-1,3 the battery> is bigger and you can get <7,0,2 it> with <8,-1,3 more storage>. However <9,-1,2 the biggest upgrade> is <10,9,3 the camera>. <11,-1,0 Previous Nexus phones> have never had <12,-1,3 great cameras> plus <13,11,2 they> were usually crippled with <14,1,1 Google><15,-1,0 's awful camera software>. <16,0,0 The 6p>'s <17,9,3 camera> is <18,9,2 such a leap> forward, <19,1,1 it> makes me completely re-think <20,1,1 my opinions> of <21,1,1 Nexus phones>.
For <0,-1,1 the same money> on <1,0,1 Virgin>, you can pick up <2,-1,0 an Idol 3>. <3,-1,0 The Vigor> has <4,-1,3 a slightly bigger 5.2” display>, <5,-1,3 removable battery> and <6,3,2 it>'s <7,3,2 a more solid phone> and you could argue that <8,3,2 it> also has <9,-1,3 a better badge>. However, <10,2,0 the Idol> has <11,0,1 a tremendous advantage> in <12,0,1 most other areas>; most importantly, <13,2,2 it> has <14,-1,3 nearly 3x as much storage> available when you first boot <15,2,2 it> up. While you have to do a bit of <16,0,1 work> to fill <17,2,0 the Idol>, <18,3,0 the Vigor> essentially comes with <19,-1,3 almost no free space>.
While we're talking about <0,-1,1 cameras>, <1,-1,0 the GS4> has <2,-1,3 a 13 megapixel unit> while <3,-1,0 the 5s> has <4,-1,3 8 megapixels>. However, <5,3,0 the 5s>' is a much more <6,0,1 versatile camera>. <7,4,2 It> does better in <8,0,1 low light>, focuses a little faster and has <9,-1,3 cleaner pictures>. I guess when you're <10,0,1 outdoors> and <11,0,1 the weather>'s nice and bright, <12,1,0 the GS4> may hold <13,-1,3 a resolution advantage> but <14,0,1 that>'s about <15,0,1 its only advantage>. I will say that <16,-1,3 battery life> on <17,1,0 the GS4> is quite a bit better than <18,3,0 the 5s>. <19,1,2 It> has <20,16,3 enough battery life> to make <21,1,0 it> through most people's day. <22,3,0 The 5s> on <23,0,1 the other hand> needs a bit of <24,0,1 help>.
I think <0,-1,0 the HTC 10>'s <1,-1,3 rear camera> is clearly better, in <2,-1,1 that> <3,0,0 it> takes <4,-1,3 cleaner pictures>. However, <5,-1,0 the G5>'s <6,-1,3 second wide angle camera> opens up a lot of <7,2,1 interesting possibilities>. <8,-1,3 The display> of <9,5,0 G5> is much brighter than <10,0,0 the HTC 10>'s. There is <11,2,1 a difference> between <12,5,2 it> and <13,0,0 the HTC> when you're outdoors in <14,2,1 direct sunlight>. <15,5,0 The G5>'s <16,2,1 wildcard> over <17,0,0 the HTC> is <18,-1,3 its removable battery>. If you plan on keeping <19,18,3 the battery> and just want to replace <20,18,2 it> quickly and cheaply down <21,2,1 the road>, <22,18,3 a removable battery> is <23,2,1 a plus>. I also find that <24,-1,3 the on-screen menu buttons> also make <25,5,0 the G5> a little easier to use.
In <0,-1,0 the end>, <1,0,0 the LG G5> is <2,0,0 a slightly different take> on <3,0,0 the flagship> than <4,0,0 the rest> of <5,0,0 the market>. <6,0,0 The removable battery> is <7,0,0 a rarity> in <8,0,0 the high end> and <9,0,0 the extra wide angle camera> is good enough that <10,0,0 it>'s actually useful. <11,0,0 the G5>'s also a bit more affordable than <12,0,0 the GS7>. While <13,0,0 it> lacks <14,0,0 the GS7>'s <15,0,0 water resistance>, <16,0,0 the G5>'s <17,0,0 dual camera design> make <18,0,0 it> interesting.
<0,-1,0 The HTC 10> is even more solid than <1,-1,0 the GS7 Edge>. But <2,0,2 it> lacks <3,-1,3 its water resistance>. <4,1,0 The Edge> has <5,-1,3 a much brighter display> than <6,0,0 the 10>. <7,1,2 It> also loses <8,-1,1 a lot less light off-angle> than <9,0,0 the HTC>. You also get noticeable <10,-1,3 better battery life> with <11,1,0 the Edge> plus <12,1,0 it> runs noticeably cooler. <13,0,0 The 10> takes <14,-1,3 better pictures> but <15,1,0 the Edge>'s <16,-1,3 launches> and focuses a bit faster <17,16,2 which> makes <18,1,2 it> a bit more usable. Of <19,8,1 course>, while <20,0,0 the 10> is <21,0,2 a pricey phone>, <22,1,0 the Edge> costs quite a bit more than <23,0,0 the 10>. I'd probably go with <24,1,0 the Edge>.
<0,-1,0 The G5> is more interesting than <1,-1,0 the Edge>. <2,0,2 It>'s considerably more affordable. <3,-1,1 What> I like about <4,0,0 the G5> is that I find <5,0,2 it> much easier to use than <6,1,0 the Edge>. <7,-1,3 The on-screen buttons> and <8,3,1 lack> of <9,3,1 a curved screen> just make <10,3,1 it> much easier to handle. <11,0,0 The G5>'s <12,-1,3 display> is pretty bright straight on but overall I think <13,1,0 the Edge> has <14,-1,0 a superior display>.
<0,-1,2 The first phone> <1,0,2 that> popped into <2,-1,1 my head> when I thought of <3,-1,0 the GS7> was <4,0,0 the Nexus 6P>. <5,0,0 The 6P> has <6,-1,3 the optical image stabilization> and <7,-1,3 water resistance>. <8,0,0 It> has <9,-1,3 the new best Snapdragon> <10,2,1 810 SoC> and <11,-1,3 a dimmer screen>. Then <12,0,0 the 6P> has <13,-1,3 a slightly better processor> than <14,3,0 the GS7>. <15,2,1 That> said, <16,0,2 it> counters with <17,-1,3 a bigger screen>, <18,-1,3 a better fingerprint reader>. <19,2,1 Another upside> to <20,0,0 the 6p> is that <21,0,2 it>'s easier to use. <22,3,0 The GS7> is just too sculpted for <23,2,1 my tastes>. <24,3,2 It> really needs <25,-1,3 a thick case> to be usable as I find myself constantly touching <26,-1,3 the screen or menu buttons> by <27,2,1 accident>. I think you should get <28,0,0 the 6P>.
<0,-1,0 The Nexus 5> has been around for 2 years now. <1,-1,1 That> said, <2,0,0 it> has aged well. While <3,-1,0 the 5x> lacks <4,-1,3 optical image stabilization>, I'd say <5,0,2 it>'s <6,0,2 an all-around better phone>. If you liked <7,0,0 the 5> for <8,-1,3 its reasonable size>, <9,1,1 note> that <10,3,0 the 5x> is quite a bit larger. <11,0,0 It> has a much bigger top and bottom though <12,-1,0 the screen> is <13,1,1 only 0.2>” bigger. On <14,3,0 the 5x>, I get <15,1,1 the feeling> <16,1,1 it>'s more to accommodate <17,1,1 Google><18,1,1 's design language>.
If you don't want <0,-1,1 something> with <1,-1,3 expandable memory> take <2,0,1 a look> at <3,-1,0 the LG G4>. <4,3,0 The G4> has <5,-1,3 a MicroSD slot>. <6,1,0 The G4> is cheaper than <7,-1,0 the Note 5>. <8,1,2 It> has <9,-1,3 a convenient removable battery> and while <10,-1,3 the back> isn't quite as elegant as <11,10,0 the Note 5><12,0,1 's glass>. I do think that <13,1,0 the G4> is <14,1,2 an easier phone> to use because <15,-1,3 the bezels> are more reasonable. I think that <16,7,0 the Note 5> should cost <17,0,1 more> than <18,3,0 the G4>. But I don't know why <19,7,0 it> costs so much more. Really, unless you absolutely must have <20,0,1 a Samsung> you're probably better off with <21,3,0 a LG G4>.
I actually really like <0,-1,0 Motorola G> as I have <1,0,2 it> now. <2,0,0 The Motorola G> has so far had <3,-1,3 better battery life> than a LG G4(obliviously) and also <4,-1,2 the HTC One M8>. <5,0,2 It> has <6,-1,3 very good RF performance>. I tried <7,-1,0 the Zenfone 2> but I sent <8,7,2 it> back and did not like <9,7,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The 635> has <1,-1,3 a much better screen> than <2,-1,0 the Desire>. <3,0,2 It> has <4,-1,3 nice colours> and <5,-1,3 respectable viewing angles> though <6,0,2 it> has <7,-1,3 a low resolution display>. I can live with <8,7,3 a low resolution display> if <9,7,2 it> looks nice. <10,0,0 The 635>'s <11,-1,3 camera> is <12,-1,1 only 5 megapixels> but <13,11,2 it> actually takes <14,0,0 pretty photos>.
<0,-1,1 It>'s hard for anyone to beat <1,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. On <2,0,1 paper>, <3,-1,2 the only advantage> <4,-1,0 the S1> has is <5,3,3 a larger display>, <6,3,3 a microSD slot> and <7,3,3 a slightly larger battery>. <8,1,0 The Nexus> has <9,-1,3 more resolution> than <10,4,0 the S1>. So <11,1,2 it> is noticeably sharper. <12,1,0 The Nexus> also has <13,-1,3 a faster SoC>, <14,-1,3 double the RAM>. <15,1,0 It> also has <16,-1,3 a superior camera>.
I've had <0,-1,1 the opportunity> to use <1,-1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S5> and <2,-1,0 the new HTC One M8> extensively. To me, I prefer <3,-1,3 the S5 display>. I do find <4,1,0 the Galaxy S5> has <5,3,3 more saturated display> than <6,2,0 the One>'s. <7,1,2 It> also has <8,-1,3 whiter whites> and <9,-1,3 deeper blacks>. <10,9,3 The blacks> are so deep on <11,1,0 the GS5>, I notice <12,9,2 them> even when don't have <13,0,1 the 2 phones> side-by-side. <14,8,3 The whites> on <15,0,1 the other hand> are not noticeable unless you're comparing directly.
<0,-1,1 My feelings> toward <1,-1,0 Windows Phone devices> have been stated many times before. I find <2,1,2 them> severely limited. Despite <3,-1,3 their smooth overall performance>, I can never bring myself to <4,1,2 them>, because <5,1,2 they> just frustrate <6,0,1 the hell> out of me. Even when <7,-1,3 well-known apps> are available for <8,-1,3 Windows Phone>, <9,7,2 they> are often <10,7,0 pale imitations> of <11,0,1 their Android or iOS counterparts>.
<0,-1,0 The Ultra Z appeals> to <1,-1,1 the bigger> is <2,1,1 better crowd>.  <3,0,2 It> has <4,-1,3 a 6.44" display>. Like <5,-1,0 the Z1>, <6,0,0 the Ultra Z> is water resistant and dust resistant. While <7,5,0 the Z1> feels nice and solid, <8,0,0 the Ultra Z> is too thin and has <9,-1,3 a really big foot print>. <10,0,2 It>'s not <11,1,1 cheap feeling>. <12,0,2 It>'s <13,0,2 just a weird shape>. I compared <14,0,2 it> to <15,-1,0 my Huawei Mate> <16,15,2 which> has <17,-1,3 a tiny 6.1" display> and look how much smaller <18,-1,3 its footprint> is next to <19,0,0 the Ultra Z> .
I'll admit, when <0,-1,0 the Note 2> came out, I wondered if we hit <1,-1,1 a point> where <2,1,1 phones> would keep getting better but at <3,1,1 a slower pace>. While <4,-1,0 the Galaxy S4> was <5,4,2 a good phone> when <6,4,2 it> was released, <7,4,2 it> wasn't <8,1,1 a huge jump> forward from <9,0,0 the Note 2>. However, when <10,1,1 Samsung> unveiled <11,-1,0 the Note 3>, <12,1,1 it> began to look like <13,1,1 they> were about to release <14,11,2 a monster> on <15,1,1 the market>. Let<16,1,1 's> check <17,11,2 it> out. <18,0,0 The Note 2> is still <19,0,0 a great device>. Even a year after <20,0,0 it> came out, I don't have <21,1,1 anything> bad to say about <22,0,0 it>. In <23,1,1 terms> of <24,-1,3 hardware>, <25,11,0 the Note 3> is <26,11,2 a huge step> forward. <27,1,1 First> off, <28,11,0 the Note 3> has <29,-1,3 the best SuperAMOLED screen> ever. <30,11,0 The Note 3> looks better and is brighter than <31,0,0 the Note 2>. <32,11,2 It> has <33,-1,3 better viewing angles>, <34,-1,3 the colour> looks nicer and <35,11,2 it> works better outdoors. <36,29,3 The screen> alone makes <37,11,2 it> worth <38,11,2 the upgrade>. <39,0,0 The Note 2> is still <40,0,2 a great device> and if you're happy with <41,0,2 it>, keep <42,0,2 it>. But if you decide to upgrade, <43,11,0 the Note 3> is <44,11,2 a substantial upgrade> and worth <45,1,1 the money> if you can swing <46,11,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 Galaxy Note> <1,0,0 3> has <2,-1,3 better display> than <3,-1,0 the Note 2>. <4,0,0 It> also has <5,-1,3 a better battery and processor>. <6,0,0 The Note 3> is lighter and thinner than <7,3,0 the Note 2>. <8,0,2 It> also has <9,-1,3 a full HD display>, <10,-1,3 more RAM, faster CPU>, and <11,0,2 it> looks way better. <12,-1,1 Samsung> did <13,12,1 great work> with <14,0,0 Note 3>, and <15,0,2 it> is definitely worth <16,0,2 the upgrade> from <17,3,0 the Note 2> to <18,0,0 the Note 3>.
<0,-1,0 The Y210> is <1,0,2 a 78-dollar phone>. <2,0,2 It> is <3,0,2 the cheapest Android phone> you can buy. <4,-1,3 The plastic screen> shows a lot of <5,-1,3 reflections> and gets oily very easily. I haven't had <6,-1,1 a chance> to use <7,0,2 it> under <8,6,1 direct sunlight> yet. You won't confuse <9,0,2 it> with <10,-1,0 the HTC One>'s <11,-1,3 display> but <12,0,2 it>'s actually not <13,-1,3 a bad display>. <14,-1,3 The plastic> on <15,-1,3 the back> is hard and unpainted. <16,0,2 It> reminds me of <17,6,1 the dash> on <18,6,1 my car>. Still, overall <19,0,0 the Y210> doesn't feel cheap. <20,0,2 It> doesn't creak or shift much when you squeeze <21,0,2 it>. <22,-1,2 One refreshing thing> about <23,0,0 the Huawei Ascend Y210> is that <24,22,3 its small size> makes <25,0,0 it> very easy to use with <26,6,1 just one hand>.
Besides <0,-1,3 the super high resolution>, <1,-1,3 the GS4 display> is simply better than <2,-1,0 the GS3> when <3,1,2 it> comes to <4,-1,1 colour> and <5,-1,3 more importantly outdoor performance>. <6,-1,0 The GS4><7,1,3 's display> is much easier to live with. While <8,-1,3 its colour> is still slightly cool, <9,8,2 it>'s much more normal looking, <10,4,1 which> will make <11,1,2 it> much easier to live with. <12,5,3 Outdoor performance> is <13,5,2 a quantum leap> forward over <14,2,0 the GS3>. <15,6,0 The GS4>'s <16,-1,3 screen> works much better than <17,2,0 GS3>'. <18,6,2 It> is good enough although <19,6,2 it> not as good as <20,-1,0 the iPhone 5> or <21,-1,0 HTC> <22,0,0 One display> in <23,4,1 this sense>. Under <24,4,1 the sun>, you don't really lose <25,4,1 any functionality>. I'd say <26,6,0 the GS4>'s is <27,1,3 the best Super AMOLED display> yet. <28,1,2 It>'s <29,1,2 the best one> since <30,-1,0 the Galaxy S2>'s.
Again, you can see <0,-1,1 what> <1,0,1 a difference> <2,0,1 the change> in <3,-1,3 resolution> makes with <4,-1,0 the Rugby>. Even though <5,-1,0 the DEFY> has <6,-1,3 a lower resolution screen>, <7,-1,3 its GPU> is much weaker than <8,-1,2 the one> in <9,-1,0 the GS3> and <10,4,0 Rugby>. I still need to run <11,0,1 my battery benchmarks> but <12,4,0 the Rugby> has <13,-1,3 a relatively large 1850mAh battery> and <14,-1,3 a sort-of-small 4” display> so <15,4,2 it> should be able to make <16,4,2 it> through the day. <17,-1,3 Sound quality> is good. <18,17,2 It> sounds clean and natural. <19,-1,3 Maximum earpiece volume> is just slightly lower than <20,-1,0 my iPhone 5> so <21,19,2 it>'s good in <22,0,1 this regard>. <23,-1,3 The speaker> is very loud. You'll never miss <24,0,1 any calls> (unless you turn <25,4,2 it> off).
<0,-1,0 The Rugby LTE> is <1,0,2 a really niche product> <2,0,2 that> doesn't have <3,-1,1 any competitors>. While <4,0,2 it> lacks <5,-1,3 the bling> of <6,-1,0 the GS3>, <7,0,2 it>'s fast. <8,-1,3 The screen> isn't huge but I don't think <9,8,2 it>'s too small. <10,0,2 It>'s <11,0,2 a good compromise> since <12,8,3 a bigger screen> might make <13,0,0 the Rugby> too big. As for <14,-1,3 the price>, <15,3,1 it>'s a little harder to say. Since <16,0,0 the Rugby> is <17,0,2 such a niche product>, there isn't much to compare <18,14,2 its price> with. You can say that <19,-1,0 a Nexus 4> is <20,19,2 a better deal> but once you dunk <21,19,0 a Nexus 4> in <22,3,1 water> or drop <23,19,2 it> on <24,3,1 concrete>, <25,19,2 it>'ll probably be worth <26,3,1 far less> than <27,0,0 the Rugby>. After <28,3,1 all>, <29,0,0 the Rugby> is more powerful than <30,-1,0 the DEFY PRO and Xperia> Go. <31,0,2 It> should be priced higher than <32,3,1 them>, right?
<0,-1,0 The X Plus> have <1,-1,3 beats logos> on <2,0,2 it>. However, <3,-1,1 HTC> has clearly done <4,3,1 some work> on <5,0,0 the X Plus> in <6,3,1 the headphone department>. <7,0,0 The X Plus>'s <8,-1,3 headphone> is much louder than <9,-1,0 the X.> <10,8,2 It>'s clearly louder than <11,9,0 the X> although <12,8,0 it> is not as loud as <13,-1,0 the 8X> I just reviewed. <14,8,0 It>'s loud enough that you might need to get <15,3,1 new headphones> if you want to your listen to <16,3,1 music> at <17,3,1 maximum volume>.
<0,-1,0 The One X Plus> has <1,-1,3 64GB storage> but, since <2,-1,0 the GS3> has <3,-1,3 a microSD card slot>, <4,-1,1 it>'s easy to add <5,-1,3 a 64GB card> to <6,2,2 it>. Where <7,-1,2 the shines> of <8,0,0 the One X Plus> is <9,7,3 its display>. <10,0,2 It> just beats <11,2,0 the GS3> at <12,4,1 pretty much everything> except for <13,-1,3 black levels>. <14,0,2 It>'s better in <15,4,1 the sun>, <16,0,2 it>'s brighter and <17,0,2 it>'s <18,4,1 less grainy>. <19,2,0 The GS3>'s <20,4,1 strength> is <21,-1,3 its software>. While <22,-1,3 Touchwiz> isn't perfect, <23,22,2 it> feels more advanced than <24,-1,3 Sense>. <25,0,2 It> also has <26,4,1 2GB> of <27,-1,3 RAM> <28,27,2 which> makes <29,4,1 a huge difference> when <30,0,2 it> comes to multitasking.
<0,-1,3 The 8X camera> focuses slightly faster than <1,-1,0 the Lumia 920>'s. If you look closely at <2,-1,0 the 8X>'s <3,-1,3 pictures>, <4,0,3 the 8X camera> captures <5,-1,1 more detail> than <6,1,0 the 920>. So, given <7,5,1 ideal conditions>, <8,0,3 it> can take <9,3,3 decent pictures>. <10,-1,3 Maximum earpiece volume> is decent though <11,10,2 it>'s not as loud as <12,-1,0 my iPhone 5>. <13,-1,3 Sound quality> is good. <14,13,2 It>'s clean-sounding with <15,5,1 little hiss>. <16,-1,3 The built-in speaker> sounds fine but <17,16,2 it>'s not very loud.
<0,-1,0 The Xperia T> feels a lot smaller and looks better than <1,-1,0 the GS3> and <2,-1,0 One X.> I love <3,-1,3 the style> of <4,0,2 it>, <5,0,2 it> is easily <6,0,2 the best> looking <7,-1,1 Xperia> since <8,-1,0 the original X1> from a few years back. <9,0,2 It> doesn't just look good, <10,0,2 it> has <11,-1,3 a metal> back <12,11,2 that> has <13,-1,3 a really slick paint job>. <14,7,2 It>'s grainy and rough so <15,0,2 it>'s much more usable than <16,-1,0 the Xperia ION><17,-1,3 's slippery finish>.
I got <0,-1,1 a chance> to play with <1,-1,0 the Sony Xperia T>. <2,1,0 The T> is known as <3,1,0 the James Bond phone>. <4,0,1 The size-wise> and <5,0,1 the lack> of <6,-1,3 hardware buttons> allows <7,1,0 the T> to be <8,6,2 a pretty compact phone>. <9,1,2 It> feels noticeably smaller than <10,-1,0 the GS2>, <11,-1,0 One X><12,1,0 , etc>. <13,1,2 It> fits well in <14,0,1 my hands>, and is solid. <15,1,0 The Xperia T> feels much more special than <16,-1,0 the Xperia ION> <17,16,2 which> was a bit of <18,16,2 a brick>. <19,1,2 It> has <20,-1,3 a matte finish> <21,20,2 that> looks awesome. <22,-1,3 The curved> back makes <23,1,2 it> really nice to hold. <24,-1,3 The paint job> on <25,-1,3 the back> feels fantastic - <26,1,2 it> reminds me of <27,1,2 a fancy camera>. <28,0,1 It>'s hard to believe that <29,1,0 the T> has <30,-1,3 a 4.6" screen> because <31,1,2 it> feels much smaller. 
<0,-1,0 The G> is <1,0,2 a really solid phone>. There's <2,-1,3 no flex or twist> at all when you squeeze <3,0,2 it>. Make sure you don't drop <4,0,2 it>! <5,-1,3 The display> is <6,5,3 a IPS LCD> display. <7,5,2 It> looks amazing. <8,5,2 It>'s sharp, has <9,-1,3 great viewing angles>. Unfortunately <10,-1,1 it>'s been raining every day lately so I haven't had to chance to try <11,0,2 it> out in <12,10,1 bright sunlight>. <13,0,0 The G> has <14,-1,3 a really narrow bezel>. <15,0,2 It>'s not <16,10,1 an easy phone> to use with <17,10,1 one hand> because <18,-1,3 the screen> is really big. If you get <19,0,0 the G> make sure you buy <20,-1,3 a case> for <21,0,2 it> <22,0,2 that> has <23,-1,3 a raised lip> around <24,-1,3 the edges>.
Despite <0,-1,0 the G>'s <1,-1,3 monster processor>, <2,-1,3 the camera>'s <3,-1,3 performance> is a lot slower than <4,-1,0 the Galaxy Note II>'s or <5,-1,0 the Apple iPhone 5>. <6,2,3 The camera> is not sensitive at <7,-1,1 all which> means <8,7,1 it> struggles mightily indoors. <9,7,1 It>'s extremely difficult to take <10,-1,3 sharp photos> indoors without <11,-1,3 the flash>. <12,0,0 The G> looks like <13,0,2 it> does well in <14,7,1 this test> but <15,0,2 it>'s actually using <16,-1,3 a very slow shutter speed>. There is <17,-1,3 a burst mode> but <18,0,2 it>'s similar to <19,-1,0 the Motorola RAZR>'s. You turn <20,0,2 it> on, press <21,-1,3 the shutter button> and <22,0,2 it> takes around <23,-1,3 6 photos>. You can have <24,0,0 the Optimus G> shoot when everyone says "<25,7,1 cheese>". I didn't try <26,7,1 this feature>. While <27,0,0 the G> does <28,7,1 a good job> of capturing <29,-1,3 audio>, <30,-1,3 video quality> isn't that great.
<0,-1,3 The speaker> is loud. I can hear <1,0,2 it> perfectly in <2,-1,1 most situations>. <3,2,1 Motorola> has designed <4,0,3 the speaker> to be heard in <5,2,1 loud areas>. <6,-1,3 The camera> is average. <7,6,2 It> takes <8,-1,3 good pictures>, but <9,-1,3 AF> is slow. <10,8,3 The pictures> have <11,2,1 adequate details> and <12,-1,3 their dynamic range> is good. <13,-1,0 the Defy Pro> plays <14,-1,3 most games> well. But <15,13,2 it> slows down with <16,14,2 larger games>. Browsing on <17,13,0 the Defy Pro> is good and I didn't run into <18,2,1 any sites> that <19,13,2 it> could not handle: <20,2,1 Your mileage> may vary. <21,2,1 My biggest issue> with <22,13,2 this phone> is that <23,13,2 it> doesn't display <24,14,3 some apps> in <25,2,1 correct orientation>. 
I have bought <0,-1,0 the IPhone> <1,-1,1 yesterday>. <2,0,0 This IPhone> is more beautiful than <3,-1,0 my old Samsung>. <4,0,2 It> has <5,-1,3 a wonderful design>. <6,-1,3 The battery> is also long enough to me. <7,6,2 It> lasts over 1 day without charging. <8,-1,3 The screen> is also nice and bright. <9,8,2 It> looks luxurious. <10,0,2 This product> is <11,0,2 a good buy>.
