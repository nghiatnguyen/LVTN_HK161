I love <0,-1,2 this phone>! I was debating between <1,-1,0 the regular S5> and <2,0,0 the S5 Active phone>, and I'm so glad I chose <3,0,0 the Active>. I've dropped <4,0,2 my phone> some times already and not even <5,0,1 a dent or scratch> on <6,0,2 it>.
I upgraded from <0,-1,0 an S3> and am very happy with <1,-1,0 my S5>. I only have <2,0,1 a couple> of <3,0,1 complaints>, <4,0,1 the first> of <5,0,1 which> is <6,0,1 the replacement> of <7,-1,0 the menu/options button> with <8,-1,0 a recent apps button>. <9,0,1 This> was already easily accessible by holding <10,-1,0 the home button> for <11,0,1 about 1 second> so I'm not sure why <12,1,2 it> needed <13,-1,0 its own dedicated button>. <14,0,1 My other complaint> is <15,-1,0 the size>. <16,1,2 It> no longer fits comfortably in <17,0,1 my pocket or car> drink <18,0,1 holder> but then again, I knew <19,1,2 it> was big when I ordered and got <20,1,2 it> for <21,-1,0 its supposed durability>. Overall, <22,1,2 it>'s <23,1,2 a great phone> with <24,-1,0 a bright, crisp display> and <25,-1,0 fast processor>.
I have only been using <0,-1,0 this Galaxy S5> for a few days so far, but I have tweaked <1,0,1 all the settings> and checked out <2,0,1 all> of <3,0,1 the features>. <4,-1,2 My previous phone> was <5,4,0 the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket>, so I skipped <6,0,0 a few generations> in between there. <7,0,1 The S5 Active phone> is definitely <8,0,0 a huge improvement> over <9,5,0 the S2>! <10,0,1 My only disappointment> with <11,0,2 this phone>, and <12,0,2 it> is very minor, is that I had thought <13,-1,0 the black bumpers> around <14,-1,0 the edges> were going to be more rubberized. <15,13,2 They> are not. <16,13,2 They> are hard, <17,0,1 matte plastic>. <18,0,2 It> makes me think that if <19,0,2 it> were to hit <20,0,1 the ground> hard enough, <21,13,2 those black pieces> would crack. I will probably end up buying <22,-1,0 a case> of <23,0,1 some sort>, just for <24,0,1 a little extra protection>.
I just received <0,-1,0 the S5> on Saturday so I haven't had <1,0,1 a chance> to get to <2,0,1 most> of <3,0,2 it> but <4,0,2 this> is <5,0,2 the best phone> I've ever owned. I'm <6,0,1 a musician> and <7,-1,0 the music player> is superb and <8,0,2 this> is <9,0,2 the first phone> with <10,-1,0 a strong Bluetooth>. I can't get <11,0,2 it> to disconnect to either <12,-1,0 my Active2 ear buds> or <13,-1,0 my Sony DR-BT50> over <14,-1,0 the ear headphones>. <15,0,1 Every other phone> I've owned, <16,-1,0 a Behold, Exhibit> and <17,-1,0 two Galaxy SII>'s all disconnect if you get <18,0,1 a body part> in <19,0,1 the way>. I'm finally happy with <20,-1,0 BLUETOOTH>. <21,0,2 The phone>'s <22,-1,0 screen> is beautiful and there aren't <23,-1,0 many HD Glass protector>'s yet <24,0,1 that> are affordable. I purchased <25,-1,0 a SUPCASE> for <26,0,2 it> but <27,25,2 it> made <28,0,2 it> to <29,0,1 large and heavy> for me so I returned <30,25,2 it> and am waiting for <31,-1,0 an Exact Soft Gel skin> to protect <32,0,2 it> as <33,31,2 it> is somewhat slippery to <34,0,1 the touch>. I've owned <35,17,0 two different Galaxy SII>'s and <36,0,2 this> is blazing fast compared to <37,17,2 those two>. <38,0,2 It> seems <39,0,1 a bit more user friendly> also. I'll update <40,0,1 this> when I have <41,0,1 more> to say but for now.
I bought <0,-1,2 a refurbished version> of <1,0,0 this S5>. Never again will I buy <2,0,1 anything electronic> <3,0,1 that> has been refurbished. <4,0,2 It> was great at first, but now, only 5 months of having <5,0,2 it>, had developed <6,0,1 extremely annoying issues>. Some of <7,0,1 which> are costing me time doing <8,0,1 my job>. At times, <9,1,0 the Internet connection> dies and <10,-1,0 the icon> disappears from <11,-1,0 the status bar> (even with <12,-1,0 a solid digital signal>). <13,0,2 It> does not return on <14,0,1 its own>. I have to restart <15,0,2 the phone> each time. <16,0,1 Average rate> of <17,0,1 occurrence> is twice weekly. But now, in <18,0,1 the last couple> of days, <19,-1,0 the speaker> will not play <20,-1,0 any sound> at all. Especially for <21,-1,0 the price> <22,0,2 it> cost. Never ever again.
<0,-1,0 This S5> is little, fast and <1,0,2 it> has <2,-1,0 crystal clear screen and voice>. Plusly <3,0,2 it>’s easy to use. I have <4,0,1 vision> and <5,0,1 hearing loss>. <6,0,2 This phone> is great for people like me when set up to <7,-1,0 Easy mode>. <8,-1,0 Battery life> is outstanding, add <9,-1,0 wireless charging>, <10,-1,0 no cables> to <11,0,1 mess> with, just pick <12,0,2 it> up and talk! YES! I am blown away to say <13,0,1 the least>! <14,0,1 Lastly my iPhone friends> have all fallen in <15,0,1 love> with <16,0,2 it>. Added <17,-1,0 a clear case> from <18,-1,0 Amazon>. Buy <19,0,2 this phone>!
<0,-1,0 My S5> is <1,0,2 an excellent phone> with <2,-1,0 dual sim capability>. <3,0,2 This phone> seems to be intended for <4,0,1 middle eastern market>. <5,0,1 One disadvantage> of <6,0,2 this phone> is that <7,0,2 it> does not support <8,-1,0 Samsung pay>, <9,8,2 which> is only supported on <10,-1,0 the US models> of <11,-1,0 S7>. Other than <12,0,1 that>, <13,0,1 everything> is <14,0,1 exactly the same>. <15,-1,0 The US model> does not offer <16,2,0 dual sim capability>. <17,0,2 The phone> came in <18,-1,0 a completely sealed box> and <19,18,0 the box> had <20,0,1 no signs> <21,0,1 that> indicated that <22,18,2 it> was opened before being shipped out.
<0,-1,0 The S7> is <1,0,2 a very good smartphone>. <2,0,2 It> is exactly <3,0,1 what> I expected and works fine with <4,0,0 my carrier> in USA (T Mobile) and outside US too. However, <5,0,1 the slot> for <6,0,1 the 2 Sim card> is <7,-1,0 the same> that carries <8,0,1 the expandable memory>. So you will not be able to use <9,-1,0 the memory> at the same time with <10,6,0 the 2 Sim cards>. <11,0,1 This> is very disappointing! In <12,-1,0 the S5> with <13,6,0 double Sim card>, you're able to have <14,6,2 both> <15,6,0 Sim cards> and expanded <16,9,0 memory> working all together.
I've owned <0,0,1 many different phones> over the years. <1,-1,2 My first real smart phone> was <2,1,0 a Samsung S3> and was <3,1,2 a great phone>. I recently purchased <4,-1,0 a S7 Edge phone> and can say <5,4,2 it> is <6,4,2 the best phone> I've ever had. I recommend getting <7,4,0 the International version> like <8,4,2 mine>. <9,0,1 All the chatter> about <10,4,2 it> on <11,-1,0 the Web> is <12,0,1 spot> on. <13,4,2 It> is <14,4,2 the fastest, smoothest, best> of <15,0,1 everything> in <16,0,1 a smart phone> <17,0,1 that> <18,0,1 money> can buy <19,0,1 today>. <20,0,1 My only complaint> is that <21,-1,0 TouchWiz> needs <22,0,1 more work>. I really want to use <23,21,2 it> but ended up back to <24,-1,0 Nova launcher> to get <25,0,1 basic features>, like <26,-1,0 vertical app drawer scroll> and <27,0,1 such>. <28,21,0 TouchWiz> needs <29,0,1 more features> control to truly be useful. However, <30,4,2 this> has <31,0,1 nothing> to do with how wonderful <32,4,2 the S7 Edge International 935FD> truly is!
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the S5> from <1,-1,0 a Galaxy Note 3> and <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,1 loads> better - faster; <4,-1,0 better screen>; <5,-1,0 much better camera>. <6,-1,0 The display> is so clear and colorful, <7,0,2 it> is simply <8,0,2 a joy> to hold and behold. <9,0,1 Any drawbacks>? You do have to hold <10,0,2 it> carefully so you aren't pressing <11,4,0 the wrap-around screen> and confusing <12,0,2 it> with <13,0,1 what> you want to do. Worth <14,0,2 it>? You bet.
I purchased <0,-1,0 this Galaxy S5> to replace <1,-1,0 my malfunctioning HTC One M7>. At <2,0,1 first glance> I have to say <3,-1,0 the screen> is gorgeous. I have watched <4,-1,0 Youtube videos> and <5,-1,0 other short clips> and was amazed at <6,-1,0 the crisp color and motion>. When taking <7,-1,0 photos>, <8,-1,0 the pictures> were nice. When I zoomed in on <9,0,2 the phone> I did start to notice <10,-1,0 some minor pixelation> so I will most likely <11,0,1 stick> to <12,-1,0 my Sony DSLR> if I really <13,0,1 what> to take <14,0,1 distant shots>. I have <15,-1,0 a few games> <16,15,2 that> I play and <17,-1,0 the controls> are seamless and react with <18,0,1 un-noticeable delays>. I have used <19,-1,0 the fingerprint login> for <20,0,2 my phone> but I can’t get <21,19,2 it> to consistently work. <22,-1,0 Calls> are clear and I like <23,-1,0 the volume boost option> although <24,23,2 it> is disabled for <25,-1,0 my Bluetooth headphones>. <26,-1,0 The battery life> is fair with <27,0,2 the phone>. Overall, I am highly impressed with <28,0,2 this product> and I am hopeful that <29,0,2 it> will last for many years to come.
<0,0,1 Everything> you've read about <1,-1,0 this S5> is true. <2,1,2 It> is amazing. <3,-1,0 The screen> is second only to <4,-1,0 the S7>, <5,-1,0 the camera> is arguably <6,5,2 the best> on <7,0,1 the market>, and <8,1,2 it> is <9,1,2 a monster> in <10,-1,0 battery life and performance>. <11,-1,0 Silver Titanium> is undoubtedly <12,11,2 the best color>. Absolutely stunning. If <13,-1,0 Samsung> found <14,0,1 a way> to implement <15,-1,0 stereo audio>, <16,1,2 it> would be perfect, but <17,1,2 it> makes up for <18,0,1 what> <19,1,2 it> lacks in <20,-1,0 sound quality> in <21,-1,0 its relative loudness> and <22,0,1 top> of <23,0,1 the line headphone output>. Rest assured that you are buying <24,1,2 the best phone> on <25,0,1 the market> right now.
<0,-1,2 This> is <1,0,2 the best cell phone> I have. <2,-1,0 The size> is <3,0,1 almost the same> as <4,-1,0 Samsung S5>, except <5,-1,0 the format edge> give us <6,0,1 a very pleasant touch and view>! <7,-1,0 The camera> is exceptional, have <8,0,1 auto focus> and <9,7,2 it> is impossible to have <10,-1,0 bad pictures>. <11,0,1 The only problem> is that <12,0,2 it> is so sensitive that <13,0,1 a single harder touch> can become <14,-1,0 multiple pictures>. <15,0,2 This> is definitely <16,0,2 the best Samsung S series phone>, and if <17,0,1 the money> is not <18,0,1 the problem>, forget <19,-1,0 the S7> and go to <20,0,0 the S7 Edge phone>!
<0,-1,2 The phone> <1,0,2 itself> works nice, very smooth and lots of <2,-1,0 storage>. I've already dropped <3,0,0 my LG> several times and <4,0,2 it> has not cracked. <5,0,2 It>'s very durable. <6,-1,2 The biggest drawback> is definitely <7,6,0 the camera>. <8,6,2 It>'s <9,6,2 absolute garbage>. If you're not looking to take <10,-1,0 high quality photos>, then <11,0,2 this> is <12,0,2 a really great phone> overall. But if you’re looking to take <13,-1,0 really nice pictures>, I'd keep looking for <14,0,1 something> else.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the LG Stylo 2> from <1,-1,0 my old Galaxy S3> and I have been very happy with <2,0,0 the LG>. I spent time comparing <3,0,2 it> to <4,-1,0 the other available Virgin phones>, and <5,-1,0 the Samsung J7> is closest in <6,0,1 specs>, but significantly more expensive. For me <7,-1,0 the large screen> was <8,7,2 the biggest selling point> and that coupled with <9,-1,0 the lower price> sold me on <10,0,0 the Stylo 2>. <11,0,2 This phone> is very responsive, quick, and <12,0,2 an all-round good performer>. <13,-1,0 Battery life> is superb, I can keep <14,7,0 that big screen> on for hours and still have <15,0,1 60-70% charge>. And <16,0,2 the phone> has <17,-1,0 sufficient on-board memory> to hold plenty of <18,-1,0 apps>, <19,-1,0 photos>, and <20,-1,0 music>.
Loving <0,-1,0 my Stylo 2> with <1,-1,0 Virgin Mobile>. <2,0,2 It> is <3,0,2 everything> I was expecting and <4,0,1 more>. <5,-1,0 Wonderfully large format screen>, <6,-1,0 good resolution>, <7,-1,0 great camera> and plenty of <8,-1,0 storage (an issue> with <9,0,1 my previous phone>). <10,0,2 The phone> is quick, responsive and <11,-1,0 the audio quality> is <12,11,2 first rate>. <13,-1,0 The incredibly slim design> really necessitates <14,-1,0 a good case> with <15,0,1 some grip> or you could easily loose hold of <16,0,2 it>. I got <17,0,1 a lovely fold> over <18,14,0 case> <19,14,2 that> is doing <20,0,1 the job> beautifully. I couldn't be happier with <21,0,2 this phone>. Excellent, and I mean <22,-1,2 excellent value> for <23,22,0 the cost>!
<0,-1,0 Stylo 2> is great. <1,-1,0 Nice big screen>. <2,-1,0 Battery> could be better and <3,-1,0 camera> is <4,3,2 ok>. <5,-1,0 Wifi> works good. <6,-1,0 Talk> is good and clear. <7,-1,0 Wireless> charging would be nice. Overall <8,0,2 a great phone> for <9,-1,0 the price>. If you are looking for <10,0,1 a fast processor phone>, <11,0,2 this> is not for you. You need to pay <12,-1,0 the higher price> for <13,0,2 a better phone> but if you do <14,-1,0 a few apps> and <15,-1,0 few games> you will be ok.
<0,-1,2 Good upgrade> from <1,-1,0 the first Stylo>. <2,0,2 It> has <3,0,1 some features> that <4,1,0 the Stylo 1> did not. <5,0,2 This> includes <6,-1,0 more internal memory>. I would say if you have <7,1,0 the Stylo 1>, <8,0,0 the Stylo 2> may take time to grow on you as <9,0,1 some features> are different. Either <10,0,1 phone> is great but <11,0,0 the Stylo 2> has doubled <12,6,0 the internal memory> than <13,1,0 the Stylo 1>. I would recommend either <14,-1,0 phone and Virgin Mobile>.
<0,-1,0 Stylo 2> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. <2,0,2 It> is very fast with plenty of <3,-1,0 storage> for <4,-1,0 apps>. <5,-1,0 SD card slot> is good for storing <6,-1,0 music>, <7,-1,0 videos>, and <8,-1,0 pictures>. I thought <9,-1,0 the camera> was fine for <10,0,2 a phone>. <11,-1,0 The screen> looks great for <12,11,2 a 5.7 inch>. <13,-1,0 Sound> was loud and <14,13,2 ok>. <15,-1,0 Stylus> is <16,15,2 a plus> and works well. <17,0,1 Only one thing> I see maybe <18,0,1 a problem> is <19,11,0 screen> may break very easy on <20,0,1 even small drops>. I got <21,-1,0 a heavy duty case> to protect <22,11,2 it>. I did play <23,-1,0 a few games> on <24,0,2 it> with <25,0,1 no problems>. <26,0,2 Phone> also has <27,-1,0 an easy mode> <28,27,2 that> is good for people <29,0,1 that> don't like a lot of <30,0,1 confusion> and tend to get frustrated with <31,0,1 technology>.
<0,-1,0 Stylo> is great. I love <1,-1,0 the size and clarity> of <2,-1,0 the screen>. Takes <3,-1,0 great HD pics>. Would definitely recommend for <4,-1,0 the price and shipping> was fast. <5,-1,0 Battery> lasts me all day and I am always on <6,0,2 phone>. <7,-1,0 Phone storage> is a small amount but get <8,-1,0 the 32gb SD card> and you will be fine.
I like <0,-1,0 the Galaxy Note 4> because <1,0,2 it> is neat and has <2,0,1 good features>. I left <3,0,2 it> by <4,0,1 accident> in <5,0,1 my car> and <6,0,1 the heat> caused <7,-1,0 the screen> to go white. Fortunately, I removed <8,-1,0 the battery> and cooled down <9,0,2 the phone>. When I put <10,0,2 it> back together, <11,0,2 it> worked perfectly. I also dropped <12,0,2 it> once and <13,0,2 it> was surprisingly sturdy although I plan never to let <14,0,1 that> happen again. I plan to have <15,0,2 this phone> for <16,0,1 a while>! I would recommend <17,0,2 it>.
<0,-1,2 This phone> is very slim, cute and easy to use. <1,0,0 Galaxy Note 4> is <2,0,2 a flip phone> and can be opened easily with <3,0,1 one hand>. Setting up <4,0,2 this phone> was <5,0,1 a piece> of <6,0,1 cake>. <7,0,2 It> came with <8,-1,0 an adaptor plug> <9,8,2 which> can fit <10,-1,0 any A/C plug>. <11,0,1 The only negative> is that <12,0,2 it> didn't come with <13,-1,0 a driver CD> and <14,-1,0 a data cable>. <15,0,1 A big plus> was that <16,0,2 it> was unlocked and was able to accept <17,-1,0 any SIM card>. <18,0,2 Great phone>!
<0,-1,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,2 an awesome, capable, gorgeous phone>. <2,0,2 It> can do so much. From <3,0,1 business> to <4,0,1 gaming>, <5,0,2 it> covers at all. <6,-1,0 The screen> is gorgeous. <7,-1,0 The CPU> is fast. You can add <8,-1,0 storage space> (unlike <9,-1,0 the Note5>) I got <10,0,2 mine> for <11,-1,0 a killer price> and I love <12,0,2 it>!
I recently got <0,-1,0 the Note 4> and have been using <1,0,2 it> for a week and <2,0,2 it> works pretty well. <3,0,2 It> came in really clean and I only saw <4,0,1 one tiny scratch> but <5,0,1 it> wasn't really noticeable at all. I love <6,0,2 my new phone> and plus, I got <7,0,2 it> for <8,-1,0 a cheap price> while <9,0,2 it> looked <10,0,1 brand> new! However, <11,-1,0 the screen> was <12,0,1 kind> of <13,11,2 weird appearing> because <14,11,2 it> had a little faded <15,0,1 label> inside of <16,11,2 it>? But <17,0,1 that> wasn't really noticeable. Overall, I think <18,0,2 this phone> has <19,0,1 all 5 stars> of <20,-1,0 functionality>, <21,-1,0 appearance>, and <22,-1,0 shipment> too! I really recommend <23,0,2 this> to <24,0,1 the other customers> and <25,0,1 they> won't regret on buying <26,0,2 it>!
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. I really love <2,-1,0 the camera> and <3,-1,0 the stylus>. I have not had <4,0,1 many problems>. <5,0,1 The only problem> I had was with <6,-1,0 the battery>, <7,6,2 it> would not hold <8,-1,0 a charge>, but <9,0,1 the seller> sent me <10,-1,0 a new battery> and <11,10,2 it> works great! I have taken <12,-1,0 many photos> and <13,12,2 they> <14,12,2 all> turned out great. <15,-1,0 The front facing camera> has a built in <16,-1,0 face tuning software> so <17,16,2 it> helps with hiding <18,0,1 blemishes> and does <19,16,2 it> automatically, but you can turn <20,16,2 it> off if you do not want <21,16,2 it>. I love how fast <22,0,2 the phone> is and <23,0,2 it>’s great for playing <24,-1,0 games>, watching <25,-1,0 movies> and <26,0,1 everything>. <27,-1,0 The 2K screen> is amazing; <28,-1,0 movies>, <29,-1,0 TV shows>, <30,-1,0 YouTube> and <31,-1,0 Netflix> all look great on <32,27,0 the screen>. <33,27,0 The screen> is very <34,27,2 responsive and fast moving>, I actually enjoy <35,-1,0 the Touchwiz UI (User Interface>). I do not have <36,0,1 any complaints> about <37,0,2 this phone>, I really love <38,0,2 it> and enjoy using <39,0,2 it>. I highly recommend <40,0,2 this phone> for anyone <41,0,1 who> is thinking about getting <42,0,2 one>.
I've been very pleased with <0,-1,2 this phone> so far, <1,-1,0 the camera> is great, <2,-1,0 the screen> is very clear and easy to read. If you like <3,0,2 big phones>, <4,-1,0 the Galaxy Note 4> is <5,0,2 the phone> for you. I've had a few times where <6,2,0 the screen> would just go black, but <7,0,1 it>'s just <8,-1,0 the app> closing down, so I'm not sure about <9,0,1 that>. <10,0,2 The phone> had little to <11,0,1 no scratches>, in <12,0,1 great condition>. I'm glad I got <13,0,2 it>! And <14,-1,0 such a good price>, too.
I've been using <0,-1,0 the Note 4> for three weeks now. <1,0,2 It>'s a bit large but <2,-1,0 the screen size> is very easy on <3,0,1 my eyes>. <4,-1,0 Operations> are very quick and I appreciate having <5,-1,2 the 3 GB> of <6,5,0 memory>. Haven't used <7,-1,0 the stylus> yet, but I have used <8,7,2 one> on <9,-1,0 the Note 10.1>, so I believe <10,7,2 it> will work <11,0,1 the same>. <12,0,2 This> is <13,0,2 a refurbished phone> and despite <14,0,1 some scratches> on <15,-1,0 the back surface>, <16,0,2 it> looks good. I have housed <17,0,2 it> in <18,-1,0 a decent case> to protect <19,0,2 it>, <20,18,2 which> added <21,0,1 some weight>, but overall I am very pleased with <22,0,2 this phone>.
<0,-1,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,2 my current phone>. I switched from <2,-1,0 the Galaxy S5> <3,2,2 which> by <4,2,2 the way> is <5,0,0 my favorite phone> I have ever owned. <6,0,2 The Note 4> is <7,0,2 a great phone>, but compared to <8,2,0 the S5> <9,0,2 it> falls short in <10,0,1 many ways>. <11,0,1 The first being durability>. I was comfortable carrying <12,2,0 my S5> around without <13,-1,0 a case>, I am <14,0,1 an outdoors man> and I had <15,0,1 no worries> of dropping <16,2,2 the phone> on <17,0,1 the ground> or in <18,0,1 a river>. <19,0,0 The Note 4> is less durable and I find myself uncomfortable carrying <20,0,2 it> without <21,13,0 a case> on <22,0,2 it>. If you are in <23,0,1 the market> for <24,-1,0 a multitasking, S pen writing>, <25,0,2 large screen phone> then <26,0,0 the Note 4> is <27,0,2 the choice> for you! If you are looking for <28,2,2 a more durable phone> with <29,-1,0 a smaller screen> then I say take <30,0,1 a look> at <31,2,0 the S5>.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the Note 4> from <1,-1,0 Galaxy S5>, and I love <2,0,2 this phone>! I was a little concerned about <3,-1,0 the size>, but now <4,0,1 that> I have had <5,0,2 it> for <6,0,1 a while>, <7,0,2 it> does not seem <8,0,1 that> big! <9,-1,0 The screen> is beautiful and <10,9,2 it> is super fast! I have used <11,-1,0 the S pen> a little, but not <12,11,2 that> into <13,0,2 it> yet. I am still learning <14,0,1 all the bells and whistles>, but from <15,0,1 what> I have learned so far I know beyond <16,0,1 a shadow> of <17,0,1 a doubt> that <18,0,2 it> is better than <19,-1,0 the IPhone 6Plus>! <20,0,2 Great phone>! <21,-1,0 Great specs>! <22,-1,0 Great camera>! And <23,-1,0 excellent battery life>! I highly recommend <24,0,2 it>!
<0,-1,0 Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>! <2,-1,0 The speed> of <3,-1,0 the processor> is amazing. I have used <4,-1,0 IPhones> and <5,5,2 they> do not even come close to <6,0,2 this device>. <7,-1,0 Android>'s <8,-1,0 OS> paired with <9,0,2 this device> has made <10,0,1 my life> so much easier. <11,-1,0 The large screen size> is great for <12,0,1 my over 50 eyes>! Do not get <13,-1,0 an IPhone>, get <14,0,2 a Note 4>!
I love <0,-1,0 my Galaxy Note 4>. I came from <1,-1,0 a LG G3> and <2,0,2 it> is by far <3,0,2 the better phone>. <4,-1,0 The battery life> is really good for <5,-1,2 a large> of <6,5,0 screen> as <7,0,2 it> has and even when I use <8,-1,0 my mobile Hotspot function>, <9,0,2 it> doesn't drain as rapidly as <10,0,1 other phone> had in <11,0,1 the past>.
I've had <0,-1,0 my IPhone 6Plus> since <1,0,1 launch> and <2,0,2 it>'s served me very well. <3,0,2 It> fits <4,0,1 my hand> perfectly and trying to use <5,0,2 a smaller phone> now makes me feel like <6,0,1 a giant>. <7,0,2 It>'s very fast and <8,-1,2 the 128 GB> has lots of <9,8,0 storage>. <10,0,1 The only problem> is recently <11,-1,0 the touch screen> hasn't been registering <12,0,1 touch> at times. <13,0,2 The phone> is almost two years old and I'm not exactly gentle with <14,0,2 it>, so I don't really blame <15,0,2 the phone>. Still <16,0,2 a great phone>.
