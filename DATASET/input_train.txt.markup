I love <0,-1,2 this phone>! I was debating between <1,-1,0 the regular S5> and <2,0,0 the S5 Active phone>, and I'm so glad I chose <3,0,0 the Active>. I've dropped <4,0,2 my phone> some times already and not even <5,0,1 a dent or scratch> on <6,0,2 it>.
I upgraded from <0,-1,0 an S3> and am very happy with <1,-1,0 my S5>. I only have <2,0,1 a couple> of <3,0,1 complaints>, <4,0,1 the first> of <5,0,1 which> is <6,0,1 the replacement> of <7,-1,3 the menu/options button> with <8,-1,3 a recent apps button>. <9,0,1 This> was already easily accessible by holding <10,-1,3 the home button> for <11,0,1 about 1 second> so I'm not sure why <12,1,2 it> needed <13,-1,3 its own dedicated button>. <14,0,1 My other complaint> is <15,-1,3 the size>. <16,1,2 It> no longer fits comfortably in <17,0,1 my pocket or car> drink <18,0,1 holder> but then again, I knew <19,1,2 it> was big when I ordered and got <20,1,2 it> for <21,-1,3 its supposed durability>. Overall, <22,1,2 it>'s <23,1,2 a great phone> with <24,-1,3 a bright, crisp display> and <25,-1,3 fast processor>.
I have only been using <0,-1,0 this Galaxy S5> for a few days so far, but I have tweaked <1,0,1 all the settings> and checked out <2,0,1 all> of <3,0,1 the features>. <4,-1,2 My previous phone> was <5,4,0 the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket>, so I skipped <6,0,1 a few generations> in between there. <7,0,0 The S5 Active phone> is definitely <8,0,0 a huge improvement> over <9,4,0 the S2>! <10,0,1 My only disappointment> with <11,0,2 this phone>, and <12,0,2 it> is very minor, is that I had thought <13,-1,3 the black bumpers> around <14,-1,3 the edges> were going to be more rubberized. <15,13,2 They> are not. <16,13,2 They> are hard, <17,0,1 matte plastic>. <18,0,2 It> makes me think that if <19,0,2 it> were to hit <20,0,1 the ground> hard enough, <21,13,2 those black pieces> would crack. I will probably end up buying <22,-1,3 a case> of <23,0,1 some sort>, just for <24,0,1 a little extra protection>.
I just received <0,-1,0 the S5> on Saturday so I haven't had <1,0,1 a chance> to get to <2,0,1 most> of <3,0,2 it> but <4,0,2 this> is <5,0,2 the best phone> I've ever owned. I'm <6,0,1 a musician> and <7,-1,3 the music player> is superb and <8,0,2 this> is <9,0,2 the first phone> with <10,-1,3 a strong Bluetooth>. I can't get <11,0,2 it> to disconnect to either <12,-1,3 my Active2 ear buds> or <13,-1,3 my Sony DR-BT50> over <14,-1,3 the ear headphones>. <15,0,1 Every other phone> I've owned, <16,-1,0 a Behold, Exhibit> and <17,-1,0 two Galaxy SII>'s all disconnect if you get <18,0,1 a body part> in <19,0,1 the way>. I'm finally happy with <20,-1,3 BLUETOOTH>. <21,0,2 The phone>'s <22,-1,3 screen> is beautiful and there aren't <23,-1,3 many HD Glass protector>'s yet <24,0,1 that> are affordable. I purchased <25,-1,3 a SUPCASE> for <26,0,2 it> but <27,25,2 it> made <28,0,2 it> to <29,0,1 large and heavy> for me so I returned <30,25,2 it> and am waiting for <31,-1,3 an Exact Soft Gel skin> to protect <32,0,2 it> as <33,31,2 it> is somewhat slippery to <34,0,1 the touch>. I've owned <35,17,0 two different Galaxy SII>'s and <36,0,2 this> is blazing fast compared to <37,17,2 those two>. <38,0,2 It> seems <39,0,1 a bit more user friendly> also. I'll update <40,0,1 this> when I have <41,0,1 more> to say but for now.
I bought <0,-1,1 a refurbished version> of <1,-1,0 this S5>. Never again will I buy <2,0,1 anything electronic> <3,0,1 that> has been refurbished. <4,1,2 It> was great at first, but now, only 5 months of having <5,1,2 it>, had developed <6,0,1 extremely annoying issues>. Some of <7,0,1 which> are costing me time doing <8,0,1 my job>. At times, <9,-1,3 the Internet connection> dies and <10,-1,3 the icon> disappears from <11,-1,3 the status bar> (even with <12,-1,3 a solid digital signal>). <13,1,2 It> does not return on <14,0,1 its own>. I have to restart <15,1,2 the phone> each time. <16,0,1 Average rate> of <17,0,1 occurrence> is twice weekly. But now, in <18,0,1 the last couple> of days, <19,-1,3 the speaker> will not play <20,-1,3 any sound> at all. Especially for <21,-1,3 the price> <22,1,2 it> cost. Never ever again.
<0,-1,0 This S5> is little, fast and <1,0,2 it> has <2,-1,3 crystal clear screen and voice>. Plusly <3,0,2 it>’s easy to use. I have <4,0,1 vision> and <5,0,1 hearing loss>. <6,0,2 This phone> is great for people like me when set up to <7,-1,3 Easy mode>. <8,-1,3 Battery life> is outstanding, add <9,-1,3 wireless charging>, <10,-1,3 no cables> to <11,0,1 mess> with, just pick <12,0,2 it> up and talk! YES! I am blown away to say <13,0,1 the least>! <14,0,1 Lastly my iPhone friends> have all fallen in <15,0,1 love> with <16,0,2 it>. Added <17,-1,3 a clear case> from <18,-1,3 Amazon>. Buy <19,0,2 this phone>!
<0,-1,0 My S5> is <1,0,2 an excellent phone> with <2,-1,3 dual sim capability>. <3,0,2 This phone> seems to be intended for <4,0,1 middle eastern market>. <5,0,1 One disadvantage> of <6,0,2 this phone> is that <7,0,2 it> does not support <8,-1,3 Samsung pay>, <9,8,3 which> is only supported on <10,-1,3 the US models> of <11,-1,0 S7>. Other than <12,0,1 that>, <13,0,1 everything> is <14,0,1 exactly the same>. <15,-1,3 The US model> does not offer <16,2,3 dual sim capability>. <17,0,2 The phone> came in <18,-1,3 a completely sealed box> and <19,18,3 the box> had <20,0,1 no signs> <21,4,3 that> indicated that <22,18,2 it> was opened before being shipped out.
<0,-1,0 The S7> is <1,0,2 a very good smartphone>. <2,0,2 It> is exactly <3,0,1 what> I expected and works fine with <4,-1,3 my carrier> in USA (T Mobile) and outside US too. However, <5,0,1 the slot> for <6,-1,3 the 2 Sim card> is <7,-1,1 the same> that carries <8,-1,3 the expandable memory>. So you will not be able to use <9,-1,3 the memory> at the same time with <10,6,3 the 2 Sim cards>. <11,0,1 This> is very disappointing! In <12,-1,0 the S5> with <13,6,3 double Sim card>, you're able to have <14,3,2 both> <15,6,3 Sim cards> and expanded <16,8,3 memory> working all together.
I've owned <0,0,1 many different phones> over the years. <1,-1,2 My first real smart phone> was <2,1,0 a Samsung S3> and was <3,1,2 a great phone>. I recently purchased <4,-1,0 a S7 Edge phone> and can say <5,4,2 it> is <6,4,2 the best phone> I've ever had. I recommend getting <7,4,2 the International version> like <8,4,2 mine>. <9,0,1 All the chatter> about <10,4,2 it> on <11,-1,3 the Web> is <12,0,1 spot> on. <13,4,2 It> is <14,4,2 the fastest, smoothest, best> of <15,0,1 everything> in <16,0,1 a smart phone> <17,0,1 that> <18,0,1 money> can buy <19,0,1 today>. <20,0,1 My only complaint> is that <21,-1,3 TouchWiz> needs <22,0,1 more work>. I really want to use <23,21,2 it> but ended up back to <24,-1,3 Nova launcher> to get <25,0,1 basic features>, like <26,-1,3 vertical app drawer scroll> and <27,0,1 such>. <28,21,3 TouchWiz> needs <29,0,1 more features> control to truly be useful. However, <30,4,2 this> has <31,0,1 nothing> to do with how wonderful <32,4,0 the S7 Edge International 935FD> truly is!
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the S5> from <1,-1,0 a Galaxy Note 3> and <2,0,2 it> is <3,0,1 loads> better - faster; <4,-1,3 better screen>; <5,-1,3 much better camera>. <6,-1,3 The display> is so clear and colorful, <7,0,2 it> is simply <8,0,2 a joy> to hold and behold. <9,0,1 Any drawbacks>? You do have to hold <10,0,2 it> carefully so you aren't pressing <11,4,3 the wrap-around screen> and confusing <12,0,2 it> with <13,0,1 what> you want to do. Worth <14,0,2 it>? You bet.
I purchased <0,-1,0 this Galaxy S5> to replace <1,-1,0 my malfunctioning HTC One M7>. At <2,0,1 first glance> I have to say <3,-1,3 the screen> is gorgeous. I have watched <4,-1,3 Youtube videos> and <5,-1,3 other short clips> and was amazed at <6,-1,3 the crisp color and motion>. When taking <7,-1,3 photos>, <8,-1,3 the pictures> were nice. When I zoomed in on <9,0,2 the phone> I did start to notice <10,-1,3 some minor pixelation> so I will most likely <11,0,1 stick> to <12,-1,0 my Sony DSLR> if I really <13,0,1 what> to take <14,0,1 distant shots>. I have <15,-1,3 a few games> <16,15,2 that> I play and <17,-1,3 the controls> are seamless and react with <18,0,1 un-noticeable delays>. I have used <19,-1,3 the fingerprint login> for <20,0,2 my phone> but I can’t get <21,19,2 it> to consistently work. <22,-1,3 Calls> are clear and I like <23,-1,3 the volume boost option> although <24,23,2 it> is disabled for <25,-1,3 my Bluetooth headphones>. <26,-1,3 The battery life> is fair with <27,0,2 the phone>. Overall, I am highly impressed with <28,0,2 this product> and I am hopeful that <29,0,2 it> will last for many years to come.
<0,0,1 Everything> you've read about <1,-1,0 this S5> is true. <2,1,2 It> is amazing. <3,-1,3 The screen> is second only to <4,-1,0 the S7>, <5,-1,3 the camera> is arguably <6,5,2 the best> on <7,0,1 the market>, and <8,1,2 it> is <9,1,2 a monster> in <10,-1,3 battery life and performance>. <11,-1,2 Silver Titanium> is undoubtedly <12,11,3 the best color>. Absolutely stunning. If <13,-1,3 Samsung> found <14,0,1 a way> to implement <15,-1,3 stereo audio>, <16,1,2 it> would be perfect, but <17,1,2 it> makes up for <18,0,1 what> <19,1,2 it> lacks in <20,-1,3 sound quality> in <21,-1,3 its relative loudness> and <22,0,1 top> of <23,0,1 the line headphone output>. Rest assured that you are buying <24,1,2 the best phone> on <25,0,1 the market> right now.
<0,-1,2 This> is <1,0,2 the best cell phone> I have. <2,-1,3 The size> is <3,0,1 almost the same> as <4,-1,0 Samsung S5>, except <5,-1,3 the format edge> give us <6,0,1 a very pleasant touch and view>! <7,-1,3 The camera> is exceptional, have <8,0,1 auto focus> and <9,7,2 it> is impossible to have <10,-1,3 bad pictures>. <11,0,1 The only problem> is that <12,0,2 it> is so sensitive that <13,0,1 a single harder touch> can become <14,-1,3 multiple pictures>. <15,0,2 This> is definitely <16,0,2 the best Samsung S series phone>, and if <17,0,1 the money> is not <18,0,1 the problem>, forget <19,-1,0 the S7> and go to <20,0,0 the S7 Edge phone>!
<0,-1,2 The phone> <1,0,2 itself> works nice, very smooth and lots of <2,-1,3 storage>. I've already dropped <3,0,0 my LG> several times and <4,0,2 it> has not cracked. <5,0,2 It>'s very durable. <6,-1,2 The biggest drawback> is definitely <7,6,3 the camera>. <8,6,2 It>'s <9,6,2 absolute garbage>. If you're not looking to take <10,-1,3 high quality photos>, then <11,0,2 this> is <12,0,2 a really great phone> overall. But if you’re looking to take <13,-1,3 really nice pictures>, I'd keep looking for <14,0,1 something> else.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the LG Stylo 2> from <1,-1,0 my old Galaxy S3> and I have been very happy with <2,0,0 the LG>. I spent time comparing <3,0,2 it> to <4,-1,0 the other available Virgin phones>, and <5,-1,0 the Samsung J7> is closest in <6,0,1 specs>, but significantly more expensive. For me <7,-1,3 the large screen> was <8,7,2 the biggest selling point> and that coupled with <9,-1,3 the lower price> sold me on <10,0,0 the Stylo 2>. <11,0,2 This phone> is very responsive, quick, and <12,0,2 an all-round good performer>. <13,-1,3 Battery life> is superb, I can keep <14,7,3 that big screen> on for hours and still have <15,0,1 60-70% charge>. And <16,0,2 the phone> has <17,-1,3 sufficient on-board memory> to hold plenty of <18,-1,3 apps>, <19,-1,3 photos>, and <20,-1,3 music>.
Loving <0,-1,0 my Stylo 2> with <1,-1,3 Virgin Mobile>. <2,0,2 It> is <3,0,2 everything> I was expecting and <4,0,1 more>. <5,-1,3 Wonderfully large format screen>, <6,-1,3 good resolution>, <7,-1,3 great camera> and plenty of <8,-1,3 storage (an issue> with <9,0,1 my previous phone>). <10,0,2 The phone> is quick, responsive and <11,-1,3 the audio quality> is <12,11,2 first rate>. <13,-1,3 The incredibly slim design> really necessitates <14,-1,3 a good case> with <15,0,1 some grip> or you could easily loose hold of <16,0,2 it>. I got <17,0,1 a lovely fold> over <18,14,3 case> <19,14,2 that> is doing <20,0,1 the job> beautifully. I couldn't be happier with <21,0,2 this phone>. Excellent, and I mean <22,-1,2 excellent value> for <23,22,3 the cost>!
<0,-1,0 Stylo 2> is great. <1,-1,0 Nice big screen>. <2,-1,3 Battery> could be better and <3,-1,3 camera> is <4,3,2 ok>. <5,-1,3 Wifi> works good. <6,-1,3 Talk> is good and clear. <7,-1,3 Wireless> charging would be nice. Overall <8,0,2 a great phone> for <9,-1,3 the price>. If you are looking for <10,-1,3 a fast processor phone>, <11,0,2 this> is not for you. You need to pay <12,-1,3 the higher price> for <13,0,2 a better phone> but if you do <14,-1,3 a few apps> and <15,-1,3 few games> you will be ok.
<0,-1,2 Good upgrade> from <1,-1,0 the first Stylo>. <2,0,2 It> has <3,0,1 some features> that <4,1,0 the Stylo 1> did not. <5,0,2 This> includes <6,-1,3 more internal memory>. I would say if you have <7,1,0 the Stylo 1>, <8,0,0 the Stylo 2> may take time to grow on you as <9,0,1 some features> are different. Either <10,0,1 phone> is great but <11,0,0 the Stylo 2> has doubled <12,6,3 the internal memory> than <13,1,0 the Stylo 1>. I would recommend either <14,-1,3 phone and Virgin Mobile>.
<0,-1,0 Stylo 2> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. <2,0,2 It> is very fast with plenty of <3,-1,3 storage> for <4,-1,3 apps>. <5,-1,3 SD card slot> is good for storing <6,-1,3 music>, <7,-1,3 videos>, and <8,-1,3 pictures>. I thought <9,-1,3 the camera> was fine for <10,0,2 a phone>. <11,-1,3 The screen> looks great for <12,11,2 a 5.7 inch>. <13,-1,3 Sound> was loud and <14,13,2 ok>. <15,-1,3 Stylus> is <16,15,2 a plus> and works well. <17,0,1 Only one thing> I see maybe <18,0,1 a problem> is <19,11,3 screen> may break very easy on <20,0,1 even small drops>. I got <21,-1,3 a heavy duty case> to protect <22,11,2 it>. I did play <23,-1,3 a few games> on <24,0,2 it> with <25,0,1 no problems>. <26,0,2 Phone> also has <27,-1,3 an easy mode> <28,27,2 that> is good for people <29,0,1 that> don't like a lot of <30,0,1 confusion> and tend to get frustrated with <31,0,1 technology>.
<0,-1,0 Stylo> is great. I love <1,-1,3 the size and clarity> of <2,-1,3 the screen>. Takes <3,-1,3 great HD pics>. Would definitely recommend for <4,-1,3 the price and shipping> was fast. <5,-1,3 Battery> lasts me all day and I am always on <6,0,2 phone>. <7,-1,3 Phone storage> is a small amount but get <8,-1,3 the 32gb SD card> and you will be fine.
I like <0,-1,0 the Galaxy Note 4> because <1,0,2 it> is neat and has <2,0,1 good features>. I left <3,0,2 it> by <4,0,1 accident> in <5,0,1 my car> and <6,0,1 the heat> caused <7,-1,3 the screen> to go white. Fortunately, I removed <8,-1,3 the battery> and cooled down <9,0,2 the phone>. When I put <10,0,2 it> back together, <11,0,2 it> worked perfectly. I also dropped <12,0,2 it> once and <13,0,2 it> was surprisingly sturdy although I plan never to let <14,0,1 that> happen again. I plan to have <15,0,2 this phone> for <16,0,1 a while>! I would recommend <17,0,2 it>.
<0,-1,2 This phone> is very slim, cute and easy to use. <1,0,0 Galaxy Note 4> is <2,0,2 a flip phone> and can be opened easily with <3,0,1 one hand>. Setting up <4,0,2 this phone> was <5,0,1 a piece> of <6,0,1 cake>. <7,0,2 It> came with <8,-1,3 an adaptor plug> <9,8,2 which> can fit <10,-1,3 any A/C plug>. <11,0,1 The only negative> is that <12,0,2 it> didn't come with <13,-1,3 a driver CD> and <14,-1,3 a data cable>. <15,0,1 A big plus> was that <16,0,2 it> was unlocked and was able to accept <17,-1,3 any SIM card>. <18,0,2 Great phone>!
<0,-1,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,2 an awesome, capable, gorgeous phone>. <2,0,2 It> can do so much. From <3,0,1 business> to <4,0,1 gaming>, <5,0,2 it> covers at all. <6,-1,3 The screen> is gorgeous. <7,-1,3 The CPU> is fast. You can add <8,-1,3 storage space> (unlike <9,-1,0 the Note5>) I got <10,0,2 mine> for <11,-1,3 a killer price> and I love <12,0,2 it>!
I recently got <0,-1,0 the Note 4> and have been using <1,0,2 it> for a week and <2,0,2 it> works pretty well. <3,0,2 It> came in really clean and I only saw <4,0,1 one tiny scratch> but <5,0,1 it> wasn't really noticeable at all. I love <6,0,2 my new phone> and plus, I got <7,0,2 it> for <8,-1,3 a cheap price> while <9,0,2 it> looked <10,0,1 brand> new! However, <11,-1,3 the screen> was <12,0,1 kind> of <13,11,2 weird appearing> because <14,11,2 it> had a little faded <15,0,1 label> inside of <16,11,2 it>? But <17,0,1 that> wasn't really noticeable. Overall, I think <18,0,2 this phone> has <19,0,1 all 5 stars> of <20,-1,3 functionality>, <21,-1,3 appearance>, and <22,-1,3 shipment> too! I really recommend <23,0,2 this> to <24,0,1 the other customers> and <25,0,1 they> won't regret on buying <26,0,2 it>!
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. I really love <2,-1,3 the camera> and <3,-1,3 the stylus>. I have not had <4,0,1 many problems>. <5,0,1 The only problem> I had was with <6,-1,3 the battery>, <7,6,2 it> would not hold <8,-1,0 a charge>, but <9,0,1 the seller> sent me <10,-1,3 a new battery> and <11,10,2 it> works great! I have taken <12,-1,3 many photos> and <13,12,2 they> <14,12,2 all> turned out great. <15,-1,3 The front facing camera> has a built in <16,-1,3 face tuning software> so <17,16,2 it> helps with hiding <18,0,1 blemishes> and does <19,16,2 it> automatically, but you can turn <20,16,2 it> off if you do not want <21,16,2 it>. I love how fast <22,0,2 the phone> is and <23,0,2 it>’s great for playing <24,-1,3 games>, watching <25,-1,3 movies> and <26,0,1 everything>. <27,-1,3 The 2K screen> is amazing; <28,-1,3 movies>, <29,-1,3 TV shows>, <30,-1,3 YouTube> and <31,-1,3 Netflix> all look great on <32,27,3 the screen>. <33,27,3 The screen> is very <34,27,2 responsive and fast moving>, I actually enjoy <35,-1,3 the Touchwiz UI (User Interface>). I do not have <36,0,1 any complaints> about <37,0,2 this phone>, I really love <38,0,2 it> and enjoy using <39,0,2 it>. I highly recommend <40,0,2 this phone> for anyone <41,0,1 who> is thinking about getting <42,0,2 one>.
I've been very pleased with <0,-1,2 this phone> so far, <1,-1,3 the camera> is great, <2,-1,3 the screen> is very clear and easy to read. If you like <3,0,2 big phones>, <4,-1,0 the Galaxy Note 4> is <5,0,2 the phone> for you. I've had a few times where <6,2,3 the screen> would just go black, but <7,0,1 it>'s just <8,-1,3 the app> closing down, so I'm not sure about <9,0,1 that>. <10,0,2 The phone> had little to <11,0,1 no scratches>, in <12,0,1 great condition>. I'm glad I got <13,0,2 it>! And <14,-1,3 such a good price>, too.
I've been using <0,-1,0 the Note 4> for three weeks now. <1,0,2 It>'s a bit large but <2,-1,3 the screen size> is very easy on <3,0,1 my eyes>. <4,-1,3 Operations> are very quick and I appreciate having <5,-1,2 the 3 GB> of <6,5,3 memory>. Haven't used <7,-1,3 the stylus> yet, but I have used <8,7,2 one> on <9,-1,0 the Note 10.1>, so I believe <10,7,2 it> will work <11,0,1 the same>. <12,0,2 This> is <13,0,2 a refurbished phone> and despite <14,0,1 some scratches> on <15,-1,3 the back surface>, <16,0,2 it> looks good. I have housed <17,0,2 it> in <18,-1,3 a decent case> to protect <19,0,2 it>, <20,18,2 which> added <21,0,1 some weight>, but overall I am very pleased with <22,0,2 this phone>.
<0,-1,0 The Galaxy Note 4> is <1,0,2 my current phone>. I switched from <2,-1,0 the Galaxy S5> <3,2,2 which> by <4,2,2 the way> is <5,0,0 my favorite phone> I have ever owned. <6,0,2 The Note 4> is <7,0,2 a great phone>, but compared to <8,2,0 the S5> <9,0,2 it> falls short in <10,0,1 many ways>. <11,0,1 The first being durability>. I was comfortable carrying <12,2,0 my S5> around without <13,-1,3 a case>, I am <14,0,1 an outdoors man> and I had <15,0,1 no worries> of dropping <16,2,2 the phone> on <17,0,1 the ground> or in <18,0,1 a river>. <19,0,0 The Note 4> is less durable and I find myself uncomfortable carrying <20,0,2 it> without <21,13,0 a case> on <22,0,2 it>. If you are in <23,0,1 the market> for <24,-1,3 a multitasking, S pen writing>, <25,0,2 large screen phone> then <26,0,0 the Note 4> is <27,0,2 the choice> for you! If you are looking for <28,2,2 a more durable phone> with <29,-1,3 a smaller screen> then I say take <30,0,1 a look> at <31,2,0 the S5>.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the Note 4> from <1,-1,0 Galaxy S5>, and I love <2,0,2 this phone>! I was a little concerned about <3,-1,3 the size>, but now <4,0,1 that> I have had <5,0,2 it> for <6,0,1 a while>, <7,0,2 it> does not seem <8,0,1 that> big! <9,-1,3 The screen> is beautiful and <10,9,2 it> is super fast! I have used <11,-1,3 the S pen> a little, but not <12,11,2 that> into <13,0,2 it> yet. I am still learning <14,0,1 all the bells and whistles>, but from <15,0,1 what> I have learned so far I know beyond <16,0,1 a shadow> of <17,0,1 a doubt> that <18,0,2 it> is better than <19,-1,0 the IPhone 6Plus>! <20,0,2 Great phone>! <21,-1,3 Great specs>! <22,-1,3 Great camera>! And <23,-1,3 excellent battery life>! I highly recommend <24,0,2 it>!
<0,-1,0 Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>! <2,-1,3 The speed> of <3,-1,3 the processor> is amazing. I have used <4,-1,0 IPhones> and <5,-1,2 they> do not even come close to <6,0,2 this device>. <7,-1,3 Android>'s <8,-1,3 OS> paired with <9,0,2 this device> has made <10,0,1 my life> so much easier. <11,-1,3 The large screen size> is great for <12,0,1 my over 50 eyes>! Do not get <13,-1,0 an IPhone>, get <14,0,2 a Note 4>!
I love <0,-1,0 my Galaxy Note 4>. I came from <1,-1,0 a LG G3> and <2,0,2 it> is by far <3,0,2 the better phone>. <4,-1,3 The battery life> is really good for <5,-1,2 a large> of <6,5,3 screen> as <7,0,2 it> has and even when I use <8,-1,3 my mobile Hotspot function>, <9,0,2 it> doesn't drain as rapidly as <10,0,1 other phone> had in <11,0,1 the past>.
I've had <0,-1,0 my IPhone 6Plus> since <1,0,1 launch> and <2,0,2 it>'s served me very well. <3,0,2 It> fits <4,0,1 my hand> perfectly and trying to use <5,0,2 a smaller phone> now makes me feel like <6,0,1 a giant>. <7,0,2 It>'s very fast and <8,-1,2 the 128 GB> has lots of <9,8,3 storage>. <10,0,1 The only problem> is recently <11,-1,3 the touch screen> hasn't been registering <12,0,1 touch> at times. <13,0,2 The phone> is almost two years old and I'm not exactly gentle with <14,0,2 it>, so I don't really blame <15,0,2 the phone>. Still <16,0,2 a great phone>.
When I look at <0,-1,0 the Zen phone>, <1,-1,2 the first competitor> <2,1,2 that> comes to mind is <3,1,0 the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3>. <4,1,2 It> costs <5,-1,1 about the same money>, and has <6,5,1 very similar specs>. <7,0,0 The Zen> pulls ahead with <8,-1,3 a processor> <9,8,2 that>'s about 30% faster, with <10,-1,3 dual SIMs> and <11,-1,3 a slightly better camera>. <12,-1,3 The Idol counters> with <13,-1,3 its powerful stereo speakers> <14,5,1 which> just happen to be <15,0,0 the Zen>'s <16,5,1 weakness> and <17,5,1 more durable finishes>. <18,5,1 One question mark> is how diligent <19,5,1 Asus and Alcatel> will be when <20,5,1 it> comes to <21,5,1 Android updates>. I don't have <22,5,1 any experience> with <23,-1,3 Asus>, but according to <24,5,1 Wikipedia> <25,5,1 they>'ve updated many of <26,5,1 their recent phones> from <27,5,1 KitKat> to <28,5,1 Lollipop> so I give <29,5,1 them> <30,5,1 the advantage> here. Still, while <31,0,0 the Zen> will attract a lot of <32,5,1 notice> because of <33,8,3 its powerful processor> and to <34,10,2 a lesser extent>, <35,10,3 its dual SIMs>, I think <36,1,0 the Idol> is <37,1,2 a more balance package> than <38,0,0 the Zen>. <39,1,2 It> still possesses enough for most people although <40,1,2 it> lacks <41,0,0 the Zen><42,-1,3 's raw processing power>. I guess <43,5,1 it>'s more that <44,0,0 the Zen> has <45,5,1 a significant weakness> while <46,1,0 the Idol> doesn't. 
<0,-1,1 All> in <1,0,1 all>, <2,0,1 Asus> has really shaken <3,0,1 things> up with <4,-1,0 the Zenfone 2>. If <5,4,2 it> had <6,-1,3 a fancier badge> on <7,4,2 it>, <8,0,1 they> could have charged double for <9,4,2 it> - <10,4,2 it>'s <11,4,2 a phenomenal value> and is really going to make <12,0,1 things> tough for <13,0,1 other companies>. <14,4,2 It>'s not <15,-1,3 just a powerful processor> attached to <16,0,1 a mediocre phone> either. <17,-1,3 The display> is also quite good. <18,4,2 It>'s not <19,0,1 quite flagship material> but <20,4,2 it>'s easily good enough for <21,0,1 most users>. <22,4,2 It>'s as sharp as <23,0,1 a flagship and colour> is reasonable. <24,0,1 The rest> of <25,4,0 the Zen> however is a bit of <26,0,1 a compromise>. <27,-1,3 The plastic> on <28,-1,3 the back cover> is cheap and very easy to <29,0,1 damage>. Still, <30,0,1 this> is pretty minor, after <31,0,1 all>, how often do we take <32,-1,3 our SIM and MicroSD cards>? Plus you can put <33,4,3 the Zenfone 2> in <34,-1,3 a case> and suddenly <35,27,2 the cheap plastic> isn't <36,0,1 a big deal>. As for <37,-1,3 the camera>, <38,37,2 it>'s not bad but <39,37,2 it>'s not that <40,0,1 great> either, I'd say <41,37,2 it>'s <42,0,1 a good> for <43,0,1 the price point> <44,37,2 but not a great deal> like <45,15,3 the processor> is. <46,4,0 The Zenfone 2> really punishes <47,-1,0 the Moto G 2014> as far as <48,0,1 value> for <49,0,1 your money> goes and is <50,4,2 a clear leader> when <51,4,2 it> comes to <52,0,1 bang> for <53,0,1 your buck>.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy A5> was released in <1,-1,1 Canada> recently. <2,-1,2 The biggest feature> is <3,2,3 the metal frame> <4,2,2 which> makes <5,2,2 it> very solid. You get <6,2,2 a slick metal frame> with <7,-1,3 a plastic> back. <8,0,2 It>'s <9,0,2 a budget phone> with <10,-1,3 expensive clothes>. <11,-1,3 The edges> are <12,11,3 chamfered edge> like <13,-1,0 the Galaxy Alpha> or <14,-1,0 the Note 5>. I like how <15,0,1 they> ditched <16,-1,0 the Alpha><17,-1,3 's corner> bulges. While <18,1,1 it> make <19,0,0 the A5>'s <20,-1,3 body> less interesting, <21,1,1 it> makes <22,0,2 it> much more comfortable to hold. <23,-1,0 The buttons> are all quite good. <24,1,1 They> stick just enough and click nicely when you press <25,23,2 them> in. <26,23,2 They> also don't wobble when you <27,1,1 half press> <28,23,2 them>. <29,7,2 The only downside> to <30,20,3 the A5 body> is <31,7,3 the plastic> back. <32,7,2 It>'s not <33,1,1 glass> like <34,0,0 many other recent Samsung phones>. In <35,1,1 the end>, <36,0,0 the A5> is <37,0,2 an entry-level phone> with <38,20,3 the body> of <39,0,2 a flagship phone>. <40,0,2 It>'s like <41,0,0 a hotdog> served with <42,1,1 a side> of <43,1,1 caviar>, <44,1,1 an Armani blazer> with <45,1,1 a pair jeans> <46,1,1 that> have <47,1,1 a hole> in <48,1,1 the seat>. Still, if you can appreciate <49,-1,3 the exterior> and don't have <50,-1,3 great processing> needs <51,0,0 the A5> could be <52,0,2 an interesting choice>.
<0,-1,1 The fact> that <1,-1,0 the GS5> is from <2,0,1 Samsung> makes <3,0,1 it> <4,-1,0 the Z2><5,4,2 's biggest competitor>. <6,4,0 The Z2>'s <7,-1,2 strongest points> are <8,7,3 the side-mounted camera button>. <9,4,0 The Z2> has <10,-1,3 slightly louder speakers>, <11,10,3 slightly better battery life> than <12,1,0 the GS5>. <13,4,2 It> has <14,-1,3 a fingerprint reader> for <15,0,1 easier unlocking>, a better looking <16,-1,3 screen> and <17,-1,3 a removable battery>. Between <18,0,1 the two phones>, I'd pick <19,1,0 the GS5> for <20,-1,3 its brighter display> and for <21,-1,3 the ease> of <22,0,1 use> <23,14,2 the fingerprint reader> brings. <24,0,1 That> said, watch out because <25,1,0 the GS5> doesn't use <26,-1,3 on-screen menu buttons> so handling <27,1,2 it> can be tricky unless you stick <28,1,2 it> in <29,-1,3 a case>.
For <0,-1,1 slightly less money>, you can pick up <1,-1,0 the Nexus 5x>. <2,1,0 The 5x> has <3,-1,3 a flagship-ish Snapdragon 808> while <4,-1,0 the A9> makes do with <5,-1,0 a mid-range 618>. <6,-1,3 The 5x camera> also takes <7,-1,3 the best still photos> of <8,0,1 any phone> right now. <9,1,2 It> also has <10,-1,3 a slightly larger 2700mAh battery>. Otherwise, <11,4,0 the A9> has <12,-1,3 some pretty big advantages>; <13,1,2 it> has <14,-1,3 a much nicer looking AMOLED display>. <15,0,1 3GB> of <16,-1,3 RAM> is a little bit more convenient as is <17,0,1 the 32GB> of <18,-1,3 storage and MicroSD slot>. I also find <19,-1,3 the front-mounted fingerprint reader> more intuitive to use. While <20,4,0 the A9>'s <21,-1,3 camera> isn't as good as <22,1,0 the 5x>'s, <23,4,0 the HTC>'s <24,-1,3 optical image stabilization> helps <25,4,2 it> take <26,-1,3 better looking video> though <27,4,0 it>'s limited to <28,0,1 1080P> whereas <29,1,0 the 5x> goes up to <30,0,1 4K>. However, <31,1,0 the best thing> about <32,4,0 the A9> is <33,-1,3 its metal body>. <34,-1,3 The brushed metal> back feels like <35,0,1 glass> and has <36,0,1 a sense> of <37,0,1 occasion> sorely missing from <38,1,0 the 5x>.
For <0,-1,1 the same money> you can pick up <1,-1,2 one> of <2,1,2 my favorite>, <3,1,0 the Idol 3>. <4,1,0 The Idol> pulls ahead with <5,-1,3 a full HD display> while <6,-1,0 the M4>'s is <7,-1,3 a more pedestrian HD>. <8,1,0 the Idol> also has <9,-1,3 stereo speakers> <10,9,2 which> sound better and <11,-1,3 an beefy 3000mAh battery>. On <12,0,1 the other hand>, <13,6,0 the M4>'s <14,-1,3 speakers>, while not quite as good, are still pretty damn impressive in <15,0,1 their own right>. However, <16,1,0 the M4>'s <17,0,0 key advantage> is <18,1,0 it>'s water resistant. <19,0,1 That> plus <20,14,2 the speaker> make for <21,0,1 a great combination> in <22,0,1 the shower>. I'd personally pick <23,1,0 the Idol 3> but you can't go wrong with either. <24,1,0 The Idol>'s <25,-1,3 screen> looks better and is noticeably sharper but <26,6,0 the M4>'s <27,-1,3 water resistance> is <28,27,2 a very practical feature>.
<0,-1,0 The 6p> really improves on <1,-1,1 the previous one> in <2,1,1 almost all areas>. <3,-1,3 The screen resolution> is unchanged but <4,3,2 it> looks better. <5,-1,3 The speakers> are improved, <6,-1,3 the battery> is bigger and you can get <7,0,2 it> with <8,-1,3 more storage>. However <9,-1,2 the biggest upgrade> is <10,9,3 the camera>. <11,-1,0 Previous Nexus phones> have never had <12,-1,3 great cameras> plus <13,11,2 they> were usually crippled with <14,1,1 Google><15,-1,0 's awful camera software>. <16,0,0 The 6p>'s <17,9,3 camera> is <18,9,2 such a leap> forward, <19,1,1 it> makes me completely re-think <20,1,1 my opinions> of <21,1,1 Nexus phones>.
For <0,-1,1 the same money> on <1,0,1 Virgin>, you can pick up <2,-1,0 an Idol 3>. <3,-1,0 The Vigor> has <4,-1,3 a slightly bigger 5.2” display>, <5,-1,3 removable battery> and <6,3,2 it>'s <7,3,2 a more solid phone> and you could argue that <8,3,2 it> also has <9,-1,3 a better badge>. However, <10,2,0 the Idol> has <11,0,1 a tremendous advantage> in <12,0,1 most other areas>; most importantly, <13,2,2 it> has <14,-1,3 nearly 3x as much storage> available when you first boot <15,2,2 it> up. While you have to do a bit of <16,0,1 work> to fill <17,2,0 the Idol>, <18,3,0 the Vigor> essentially comes with <19,-1,3 almost no free space>.
While we're talking about <0,-1,1 cameras>, <1,-1,0 the GS4> has <2,-1,3 a 13 megapixel unit> while <3,-1,0 the 5s> has <4,-1,3 8 megapixels>. However, <5,3,0 the 5s>' is a much more <6,0,1 versatile camera>. <7,4,2 It> does better in <8,0,1 low light>, focuses a little faster and has <9,-1,3 cleaner pictures>. I guess when you're <10,0,1 outdoors> and <11,0,1 the weather>'s nice and bright, <12,1,0 the GS4> may hold <13,-1,3 a resolution advantage> but <14,0,1 that>'s about <15,0,1 its only advantage>. I will say that <16,-1,3 battery life> on <17,1,0 the GS4> is quite a bit better than <18,3,0 the 5s>. <19,1,2 It> has <20,16,3 enough battery life> to make <21,1,0 it> through most people's day. <22,3,0 The 5s> on <23,0,1 the other hand> needs a bit of <24,0,1 help>.
I think <0,-1,0 the HTC 10>'s <1,-1,3 rear camera> is clearly better, in <2,-1,1 that> <3,0,0 it> takes <4,-1,3 cleaner pictures>. However, <5,-1,0 the G5>'s <6,-1,3 second wide angle camera> opens up a lot of <7,2,1 interesting possibilities>. <8,-1,3 The display> of <9,5,0 G5> is much brighter than <10,0,0 the HTC 10>'s. There is <11,2,1 a difference> between <12,5,2 it> and <13,0,0 the HTC> when you're outdoors in <14,2,1 direct sunlight>. <15,5,0 The G5>'s <16,2,1 wildcard> over <17,0,0 the HTC> is <18,-1,3 its removable battery>. If you plan on keeping <19,18,3 the battery> and just want to replace <20,18,2 it> quickly and cheaply down <21,2,1 the road>, <22,18,3 a removable battery> is <23,2,1 a plus>. I also find that <24,-1,3 the on-screen menu buttons> also make <25,5,0 the G5> a little easier to use.
In <0,0,1 the end>, <1,-1,0 the LG G5> is <2,0,1 a slightly different take> on <3,0,1 the flagship> than <4,0,1 the rest> of <5,0,1 the market>. <6,-1,3 The removable battery> is <7,0,6 a rarity> in <8,0,1 the high end> and <9,0,3 the extra wide angle camera> is good enough that <10,9,2 it>'s actually useful. <11,1,0 the G5>'s also a bit more affordable than <12,-1,0 the GS7>. While <13,1,2 it> lacks <14,12,0 the GS7>'s <15,-1,3 water resistance>, <16,1,0 the G5>'s <17,-1,3 dual camera design> make <18,16,2 it> interesting.
<0,-1,0 The HTC 10> is even more solid than <1,-1,0 the GS7 Edge>. But <2,0,2 it> lacks <3,-1,3 its water resistance>. <4,1,0 The Edge> has <5,-1,3 a much brighter display> than <6,0,0 the 10>. <7,1,2 It> also loses <8,-1,1 a lot less light off-angle> than <9,0,0 the HTC>. You also get noticeable <10,-1,3 better battery life> with <11,1,0 the Edge> plus <12,1,0 it> runs noticeably cooler. <13,0,0 The 10> takes <14,-1,3 better pictures> but <15,1,0 the Edge>'s <16,-1,3 launches> and focuses a bit faster <17,16,2 which> makes <18,1,2 it> a bit more usable. Of <19,8,1 course>, while <20,0,0 the 10> is <21,0,2 a pricey phone>, <22,1,0 the Edge> costs quite a bit more than <23,0,0 the 10>. I'd probably go with <24,1,0 the Edge>.
<0,-1,0 The G5> is more interesting than <1,-1,0 the Edge>. <2,0,2 It>'s considerably more affordable. <3,-1,1 What> I like about <4,0,0 the G5> is that I find <5,0,2 it> much easier to use than <6,1,0 the Edge>. <7,-1,3 The on-screen buttons> and <8,3,1 lack> of <9,3,1 a curved screen> just make <10,3,1 it> much easier to handle. <11,0,0 The G5>'s <12,-1,3 display> is pretty bright straight on but overall I think <13,1,0 the Edge> has <14,-1,0 a superior display>.
<0,-1,2 The first phone> <1,0,2 that> popped into <2,-1,1 my head> when I thought of <3,-1,0 the GS7> was <4,0,0 the Nexus 6P>. <5,0,0 The 6P> has <6,-1,3 the optical image stabilization> and <7,-1,3 water resistance>. <8,0,0 It> has <9,-1,3 the new best Snapdragon> <10,2,1 810 SoC> and <11,-1,3 a dimmer screen>. Then <12,0,0 the 6P> has <13,-1,3 a slightly better processor> than <14,3,0 the GS7>. <15,2,1 That> said, <16,0,2 it> counters with <17,-1,3 a bigger screen>, <18,-1,3 a better fingerprint reader>. <19,2,1 Another upside> to <20,0,0 the 6p> is that <21,0,2 it>'s easier to use. <22,3,0 The GS7> is just too sculpted for <23,2,1 my tastes>. <24,3,2 It> really needs <25,-1,3 a thick case> to be usable as I find myself constantly touching <26,-1,3 the screen or menu buttons> by <27,2,1 accident>. I think you should get <28,0,0 the 6P>.
<0,-1,0 The Nexus 5> has been around for 2 years now. <1,-1,1 That> said, <2,0,0 it> has aged well. While <3,-1,0 the 5x> lacks <4,-1,3 optical image stabilization>, I'd say <5,0,2 it>'s <6,0,2 an all-around better phone>. If you liked <7,0,0 the 5> for <8,-1,3 its reasonable size>, <9,1,1 note> that <10,3,0 the 5x> is quite a bit larger. <11,0,0 It> has a much bigger top and bottom though <12,-1,0 the screen> is <13,1,1 only 0.2>” bigger. On <14,3,0 the 5x>, I get <15,1,1 the feeling> <16,1,1 it>'s more to accommodate <17,1,1 Google><18,1,1 's design language>.
If you don't want <0,-1,1 something> with <1,-1,3 expandable memory> take <2,0,1 a look> at <3,-1,0 the LG G4>. <4,3,0 The G4> has <5,-1,3 a MicroSD slot>. <6,1,0 The G4> is cheaper than <7,-1,0 the Note 5>. <8,1,2 It> has <9,-1,3 a convenient removable battery> and while <10,-1,3 the back> isn't quite as elegant as <11,10,0 the Note 5><12,0,1 's glass>. I do think that <13,1,0 the G4> is <14,1,2 an easier phone> to use because <15,-1,3 the bezels> are more reasonable. I think that <16,7,0 the Note 5> should cost <17,0,1 more> than <18,3,0 the G4>. But I don't know why <19,7,0 it> costs so much more. Really, unless you absolutely must have <20,0,1 a Samsung> you're probably better off with <21,3,0 a LG G4>.
I actually really like <0,-1,0 Motorola G> as I have <1,0,2 it> now. <2,0,0 The Motorola G> has so far had <3,-1,3 better battery life> than a <4,-1,0 LG G4> and also <5,-1,2 the HTC One M8>. <6,0,2 It> has <7,-1,3 very good RF performance>. I tried <8,-1,0 the Zenfone 2> but I sent <9,8,2 it> back and did not like <10,8,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The 635> has <1,-1,3 a much better screen> than <2,-1,0 the Desire>. <3,0,2 It> has <4,-1,3 nice colours> and <5,-1,3 respectable viewing angles> though <6,0,2 it> has <7,-1,3 a low resolution display>. I can live with <8,7,3 a low resolution display> if <9,7,2 it> looks nice. <10,0,0 The 635>'s <11,-1,3 camera> is <12,-1,1 only 5 megapixels> but <13,11,2 it> actually takes <14,0,0 pretty photos>.
<0,-1,1 It>'s hard for anyone to beat <1,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. On <2,0,1 paper>, <3,-1,2 the only advantage> <4,-1,0 the S1> has is <5,3,3 a larger display>, <6,3,3 a microSD slot> and <7,3,3 a slightly larger battery>. <8,1,0 The Nexus> has <9,-1,3 better resolution> than <10,4,0 the S1>. So <11,1,2 it> is noticeably sharper. <12,1,0 The Nexus> also has <13,-1,3 a faster SoC>, <14,-1,3 double the RAM>. <15,1,0 It> also has <16,-1,3 a superior camera>.
I've had <0,-1,1 the opportunity> to use <1,-1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S5> and <2,-1,0 the new HTC One M8> extensively. To me, I prefer <3,-1,3 the S5 display>. I do find <4,1,0 the Galaxy S5> has <5,3,3 more saturated display> than <6,2,0 the One>'s. <7,1,2 It> also has <8,-1,3 whiter whites> and <9,-1,3 deeper blacks>. <10,9,3 The blacks> are so deep on <11,1,0 the GS5>, I notice <12,9,2 them> even when don't have <13,0,1 the 2 phones> side-by-side. <14,8,3 The whites> on <15,0,1 the other hand> are not noticeable unless you're comparing directly.
<0,-1,1 My feelings> toward <1,-1,0 Windows Phone devices> have been stated many times before. I find <2,1,2 them> severely limited. Despite <3,-1,3 their smooth overall performance>, I can never bring myself to <4,1,2 them>, because <5,1,2 they> just frustrate <6,0,1 the hell> out of me. Even when <7,-1,3 well-known apps> are available for <8,-1,3 Windows Phone>, <9,7,2 they> are often <10,7,0 pale imitations> of <11,0,1 their Android or iOS counterparts>.
<0,-1,0 The Ultra Z appeals> to <1,-1,1 the bigger> is <2,1,1 better crowd>.  <3,0,2 It> has <4,-1,3 a 6.44" display>. Like <5,-1,0 the Z1>, <6,0,0 the Ultra Z> is water resistant and dust resistant. While <7,5,0 the Z1> feels nice and solid, <8,0,0 the Ultra Z> is too thin and has <9,-1,3 a really big foot print>. <10,0,2 It>'s not <11,1,1 cheap feeling>. <12,0,2 It>'s <13,0,2 just a weird shape>. I compared <14,0,2 it> to <15,-1,0 my Huawei Mate> <16,15,2 which> has <17,-1,3 a tiny 6.1" display> and look how much smaller <18,-1,3 its footprint> is next to <19,0,0 the Ultra Z> .
I'll admit, when <0,-1,0 the Note 2> came out, I wondered if we hit <1,-1,1 a point> where <2,1,1 phones> would keep getting better but at <3,1,1 a slower pace>. While <4,-1,0 the Galaxy S4> was <5,4,2 a good phone> when <6,4,2 it> was released, <7,4,2 it> wasn't <8,1,1 a huge jump> forward from <9,0,0 the Note 2>. However, when <10,1,1 Samsung> unveiled <11,-1,0 the Note 3>, <12,1,1 it> began to look like <13,1,1 they> were about to release <14,11,2 a monster> on <15,1,1 the market>. Let<16,1,1 's> check <17,11,2 it> out. <18,0,0 The Note 2> is still <19,0,0 a great device>. Even a year after <20,0,0 it> came out, I don't have <21,1,1 anything> bad to say about <22,0,0 it>. In <23,1,1 terms> of <24,-1,3 hardware>, <25,11,0 the Note 3> is <26,11,2 a huge step> forward. <27,1,1 First> off, <28,11,0 the Note 3> has <29,-1,3 the best SuperAMOLED screen> ever. <30,11,0 The Note 3> looks better and is brighter than <31,0,0 the Note 2>. <32,11,2 It> has <33,-1,3 better viewing angles>, <34,-1,3 the colour> looks nicer and <35,11,2 it> works better outdoors. <36,29,3 The screen> alone makes <37,11,2 it> worth <38,11,2 the upgrade>. <39,0,0 The Note 2> is still <40,0,2 a great device> and if you're happy with <41,0,2 it>, keep <42,0,2 it>. But if you decide to upgrade, <43,11,0 the Note 3> is <44,11,2 a substantial upgrade> and worth <45,1,1 the money> if you can swing <46,11,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The Galaxy Note 3> has <1,-1,3 better display> than <2,-1,0 the Note 2>. <3,0,0 It> also has <4,-1,3 a better battery and processor>. <5,0,0 The Note 3> is lighter and thinner than <6,2,0 the Note 2>. <7,0,2 It> also has <8,-1,3 a full HD display>, <9,-1,3 more RAM, faster CPU>, and <10,0,2 it> looks way better. <11,-1,1 Samsung> did <12,0,1 great work> with <13,0,0 Note 3>, and <14,0,2 it> is definitely worth <15,0,2 the upgrade> from <16,2,0 the Note 2> to <17,0,0 the Note 3>.
<0,-1,0 The Xperia T> feels a lot smaller and looks better than <1,-1,0 the GS3> and <2,-1,0 One X>. I love <3,-1,3 the style> of <4,0,2 it>, <5,0,2 it> is easily <6,0,2 the best> looking <7,-1,1 Xperia> since <8,-1,0 the original X1> from a few years back. <9,0,2 It> doesn't just look good, <10,0,2 it> has <11,-1,3 a metal> back <12,11,2 that> has <13,-1,3 a really slick paint job>. <14,7,2 It>'s grainy and rough so <15,0,2 it>'s much more usable than <16,-1,0 the Xperia ION><17,-1,3 's slippery finish>.
I got <0,-1,1 a chance> to play with <1,-1,0 the Sony Xperia T>. <2,1,0 The T> is known as <3,1,0 the James Bond phone>. <4,0,1 The size-wise> and <5,0,1 the lack> of <6,-1,3 hardware buttons> allows <7,1,0 the T> to be <8,6,2 a pretty compact phone>. <9,1,0 The T> feels noticeably smaller than <10,-1,0 the GS2>, <11,-1,0 One X><12,1,0 , etc>. <13,1,2 It> fits well in <14,0,1 my hands>, and is solid. <15,1,0 The Xperia T> feels much more special than <16,-1,0 the Xperia ION> <17,16,2 which> was a bit of <18,16,2 a brick>. <19,1,2 It> has <20,-1,3 a matte finish> <21,20,2 that> looks awesome. <22,-1,3 The curved> back makes <23,1,2 it> really nice to hold. <24,-1,3 The paint job> on <25,-1,3 the back> feels fantastic - <26,1,2 it> reminds me of <27,1,2 a fancy camera>. <28,0,1 It>'s hard to believe that <29,1,0 the T> has <30,-1,3 a 4.6" screen> because <31,1,2 it> feels much smaller. 
<0,-1,0 The G> is <1,0,2 a really solid phone>. There's <2,-1,3 no flex or twist> at all when you squeeze <3,0,2 it>. Make sure you don't drop <4,0,2 it>! <5,-1,3 The display> is <6,5,3 a IPS LCD> display. <7,5,2 It> looks amazing. <8,5,2 It>'s sharp, has <9,-1,3 great viewing angles>. Unfortunately <10,-1,1 it>'s been raining every day lately so I haven't had to chance to try <11,0,2 it> out in <12,10,1 bright sunlight>. <13,0,0 The G> has <14,-1,3 a really narrow bezel>. <15,0,2 It>'s not <16,10,1 an easy phone> to use with <17,10,1 one hand> because <18,-1,3 the screen> is really big. If you get <19,0,0 the G> make sure you buy <20,-1,3 a case> for <21,0,2 it> <22,0,2 that> has <23,-1,3 a raised lip> around <24,-1,3 the edges>.
Despite <0,-1,0 the G>'s <1,-1,3 monster processor>, <2,-1,3 the camera>'s <3,-1,3 performance> is a lot slower than <4,-1,0 the Galaxy Note II>'s or <5,-1,0 the Apple iPhone 5>. <6,2,3 The camera> is not sensitive at <7,-1,1 all which> means <8,7,1 it> struggles mightily indoors. <9,7,1 It>'s extremely difficult to take <10,-1,3 sharp photos> indoors without <11,-1,3 the flash>. <12,0,0 The G> looks like <13,0,2 it> does well in <14,7,1 this test> but <15,0,2 it>'s actually using <16,-1,3 a very slow shutter speed>. There is <17,-1,3 a burst mode> but <18,0,2 it>'s similar to <19,-1,0 the Motorola RAZR>'s. You turn <20,0,2 it> on, press <21,-1,3 the shutter button> and <22,0,2 it> takes around <23,-1,3 6 photos>. You can have <24,0,0 the Optimus G> shoot when everyone says "<25,7,1 cheese>". I didn't try <26,7,1 this feature>. While <27,0,0 the G> does <28,7,1 a good job> of capturing <29,-1,3 audio>, <30,-1,3 video quality> isn't that great.
<0,-1,3 The speaker> is loud. I can hear <1,0,2 it> perfectly in <2,-1,1 most situations>. <3,2,1 Motorola> has designed <4,0,3 the speaker> to be heard in <5,2,1 loud areas>. <6,-1,3 The camera> is average. <7,6,2 It> takes <8,-1,3 good pictures>, but <9,-1,3 AF> is slow. <10,8,3 The pictures> have <11,2,1 adequate details> and <12,-1,3 their dynamic range> is good. <13,-1,0 the Defy Pro> plays <14,-1,3 most games> well. But <15,13,2 it> slows down with <16,14,2 larger games>. Browsing on <17,13,0 the Defy Pro> is good and I didn't run into <18,2,1 any sites> that <19,13,2 it> could not handle: <20,2,1 Your mileage> may vary. <21,2,1 My biggest issue> with <22,13,2 this phone> is that <23,13,2 it> doesn't display <24,14,3 some apps> in <25,2,1 correct orientation>. 
I have bought <0,-1,0 the IPhone> <1,-1,1 yesterday>. <2,0,0 This IPhone> is more beautiful than <3,-1,0 my old Samsung>. <4,0,2 It> has <5,-1,3 a wonderful design>. <6,-1,3 The battery> is also long enough to me. <7,6,2 It> lasts over 1 day without charging. <8,-1,3 The screen> is also nice and bright. <9,8,2 It> looks luxurious. <10,0,2 This product> is <11,0,2 a good buy>.
<0,-1,0 My Nokia 3220 phone> is <1,0,2 a huge letdown> in <2,-1,3 functionality>.  First, I bought <3,0,2 it> for <4,-1,3 the camera>.  <5,4,3 The camera> does not allow me to send <6,-1,3 pictures>.  Or <7,-1,3 my settings>, <8,7,2 that> came with <9,0,2 the phone> are not sufficient.  <10,-1,1 This> is <11,10,1 one> of <12,10,1 the best reasons> to have <13,10,1 a camera phone>. <14,-1,2 The 2nd unique feature> <15,14,2 that> I was so excited <16,10,1 about> was <17,-1,3 the FM radio function>.  <18,0,2 My phone> does not have <19,17,2 that capability> either.  Even after sending <20,10,1 one> back and receiving <21,10,1 a brand new phone (exact model> as <22,10,1 first>), <23,10,0 no FM function>.  Now I don't have <24,-1,3 options> but to contact <25,10,1 Nokia> direct, <26,10,1 which> I don't think I should have to do with <27,10,1 a brand new phone>.  So I am not impressed with <28,0,2 this model> and do not recommend <29,0,2 it>.  I was <30,10,1 a huge Nokia fan> until <31,0,0 this phone>.
I have owned <0,-1,0 the N3220 phone> for about 6 months now.  I talk about 3500 minutes a month, send and receive <1,-1,3 about 20 emails> a day.  <2,0,2 The phone> has <3,-1,1 a bunch> of <4,3,1 great capabilities> and is occasionally <5,0,2 a great work companion>.  <6,-1,3 The wide screen> is excellent for viewing.  <7,-1,3 The CPU functions> work <8,3,1 a little slow> <9,3,1 which> could be expected from <10,0,0 such a small package>.  <11,3,1 The frustrating part> is <12,0,2 the phone> frequently works slow as well.  About once a week <13,3,1 it> is necessary to take out <14,-1,3 the battery> and let <15,14,2 it> sit for a minute before turning <16,0,2 the phone> on.  <17,0,2 The phone> takes a couple minutes to turn on.  Overall, <18,0,2 it> seems slow and unstable <19,3,1 which> overshadows <20,3,1 all> of <21,3,1 its great features>.  Reminds me of <22,3,1 Windows 98>.
<0,-1,0 My LG C1300> is <1,0,2 a really small, clamshell phone> with <2,-1,1 a part> <3,2,1 that> looks like <4,2,1 a mirror> on <5,-1,3 top>. <6,0,2 It> includes <7,2,1 most basic features> including <8,-1,3 text messaging>, <9,-1,3 multimedia> messaging, <10,-1,3 media mall>, and <11,2,1 everything> you need to download <12,-1,3 wallpaper>, <13,-1,3 games>, <14,-1,3 ringtones>, and <15,-1,3 applications> straight from <16,2,1 Cingular>. <17,0,2 It> has <18,-1,3 an awesome battery life>, but you can't always trust <19,18,3 the battery monitor>... sometimes <20,18,2 it> will display <21,2,1 one bar> left, and you'll have 2 days left. Call <22,2,1 quality> has been really good, and I know that sometimes I have <23,-1,3 bad reception>... but <24,2,1 that> is <25,-1,3 the network>, not <26,0,2 the phone>. Overall, I love <27,0,0 my LG C1300> although now I wish I might have had <28,0,2 a camera phone>, but <29,0,2 this phone> is awesome for <30,2,1 all the features> and <31,-1,3 the minimal price> involved.
We purchased <0,-1,0 A Motorola V3 GSM Razor phone> for <1,-1,1 a trip> to <2,1,1 Turkey and Greece>. <3,0,2 The phone> did not work in <4,1,1 Turkey> but <5,0,2 it> did in <6,1,1 Greece>, so I believe <7,1,1 it> was the service and not <8,0,2 the phone>. <9,1,1 My complaint> is <10,-1,3 the camera>. After documenting <11,1,1 our trip> with <12,10,3 the camera>, we now find we unable to download <13,-1,3 the pictures> without purchasing, at <14,1,1 additional cost, software and USB cable> from <15,1,1 Motorola>. Ridiculous!
<0,-1,0 The Nokia 2610> is gorgeous, and <1,-1,3 the buttons> are easy for <2,-1,1 typing> on. <3,-1,2 The only downside> of <4,0,2 this device> is <5,3,3 the Windows software>. <6,3,2 It> reminds me of <7,2,1 Windows 1998> - <8,-1,3 limited error messages> and <9,2,1 a very buggy version> of <10,2,1 Internet Explorer>.
After having had <0,-1,0 this S6> in <1,-1,1 18 months or> so, <2,1,1 my final impressions> on <3,0,2 the phone> are: <4,0,2 It>'s <5,0,2 quick, good fast processor>. <6,-1,3 Screen> is very good, better than <7,1,1 average outdoor> in <8,1,1 sun>, and shows <9,1,1 nice detail> for <10,-1,3 pictures>, <11,-1,3 videos> and <12,1,1 the such>. <13,-1,3 Phone body> is slippery. <14,0,2 It>'s not <15,0,2 a good phone> to hold in <16,1,1 your hand>. <17,-1,3 Battery life> is fair. I never felt <18,1,1 comfortable> leaving home all day without <19,1,1 a charger> handy. To me <20,1,1 this> is <21,1,1 reason> enough that I would not purchase <22,0,2 this phone> again. After nearly 18 months, <23,17,3 battery> is dead. <24,17,2 It> will not recharge. <25,1,1 Only solution> is to get <26,0,2 the phone> to <27,-1,3 service> to replace <28,17,3 the battery>. <29,1,1 It> will cost me $200 as I have <30,-1,3 phone insurance>. <31,1,1 Lesson> learned: don't ever get <32,0,2 a phone> <33,0,2 which> doesn't have <34,17,3 a rechargeable battery>, ever again.
I've not had <0,-1,0 the S6> for over a week. <1,-1,3 The screen> is fantastic. <2,-1,3 My monthly google calendar> shows up on <3,1,3 1 screen>, and <4,-1,1 it>'s easy to read <5,4,1 all the events> on <6,1,2 it>. I can actually use <7,0,2 the phone> in <8,4,1 bright sunlight>, <9,4,1 something> I haven't been able to do well with <10,4,1 prior cell phones>. There was <11,4,1 a Samsung push> update <12,4,1 which> appears to have helped <13,-1,3 the battery life>, and I for <14,4,1 that reason> have raised <15,4,1 the rating> from <16,4,1 3 to 4 stars>. <17,13,3 The battery> now lasts me all day, with <18,4,1 casual uses>. If you are <19,4,1 a heavy user>, <20,0,2 this phone> will not last you all day without <21,4,1 a re-charge> by 2 PM. <22,4,1 The good news> is that a 10-15 minutes recharge will give you <23,4,1 a 30-40% or so battery boost> and <24,0,2 the phone> can be >90% in about one hour. I still do not recommend <25,0,2 the phone> for <26,4,1 heavy app users>. You'll need to consider <27,-1,0 the Samsung note> or <28,-1,0 the Droid phones> as I can't see <29,0,0 the S6> lasting past 2 PM for <30,4,1 those individuals>.
<0,-1,2 Great phone> for <1,0,2 a great price>. <2,0,2 This phone> was almost in <3,-1,1 a new> like <4,3,1 state> when I bought <5,3,2 it> from <6,0,1 Amazon>. I love <7,0,0 the Samsung Galaxy S6>, I have had <8,-1,0 the S3> for years now and just upgraded and let me tell you <9,3,1 it> is like night and day. <10,0,2 Great phone>, quick at opening <11,-1,3 emails> & <12,3,1 such>, <13,-1,3 the screen> can be seen outside in <14,3,1 the sun light>. <15,0,2 This phone> is like taking <16,3,1 a small computer> around with you all the time. I do wish <17,-1,3 the sound> was louder, even with <18,-1,3 the ring tone> set at <19,3,1 high level> I still don't hear <20,18,2 it> all the time unless I am close by. I would for <21,3,1 sure buy> <22,0,2 this product> again!
I really liked <0,-1,0 my Samsung Galaxy S4> but <1,-1,0 the S6> is better without changing <2,-1,1 things> unnecessarily. I recommend maxing out <3,-1,3 the memory> at <4,2,1 128GB> as you can't add <5,2,1 more> later. I hope <6,-1,3 the battery> holds up since <7,6,2 it> can't be changed by <8,2,1 the user>. <9,-1,3 Voice recognition> works much better on <10,1,0 the S6> than <11,0,0 the S4>. <12,-1,3 The operating system> seems much quicker and <13,2,1 less buggy> as well.
I bought <0,-1,0 my Galaxy S7 Edge> and paid <1,-1,1 full price> for <2,0,2 it> less than 7 months ago. Now <3,0,2 the phone> is presenting <4,-1,3 a hardware problem> <5,4,2 which> was already acknowledged by <6,1,1 Samsung> that <7,4,2 it> is <8,4,2 a factory problem>, <9,1,1 what means>, <10,1,1 they> know <11,4,2 it> is <12,4,2 their problem> and that <13,1,1 they> are supposed to get <14,4,2 it> fixed or exchanged. However, because <15,0,2 it> is <16,0,0 an "Unlocked International Version>", <17,1,1 no Samsung> authorized <18,-1,3 service> would even touch <19,0,2 the phone>. Not even if I am paying for <20,18,3 the service>. So, now I have <21,0,2 a USD 800 paper weight> worth <22,1,1 nothing> at all. I hope <23,1,1 Samsung> is reading <24,1,1 this>. I have been <25,1,1 a Samsung loyal customer> since <26,-1,0 Galaxy S2> and now I am dropping <27,1,1 this "Loyalty>" for <28,1,1 a Windows Phone> (after wasting <29,1,1 my money> with <30,1,1 a "Samsung Flagship>", <31,1,1 a Windows Phone> is <32,1,1 all> I could afford to buy). <33,1,1 Thanks Samsung>, you have made <34,1,1 an (ex) customer> really unhappy!
I purchased <0,-1,0 this S7 edge> back in March. After two months, <1,0,2 it> started showing <2,-1,3 some screen color issues> with <3,-1,1 annoying purple stripes> all over <4,-1,3 the screen> and <5,0,2 the cellphone> <6,0,2 itself> feels hot. I had to set <7,-1,3 the brightness> to <8,3,1 the maximum> to temporarily "avoid" <9,2,1 screen issues>. And <10,3,1 what>'s worse, <11,4,3 the screen> just died completely and I can't even turn off <12,0,2 this phone> since <13,4,3 the screen> is no longer functioning. Now I am trying to return <14,0,2 this> failed <15,0,0 S7 edge> and get <16,3,1 my money> back and never want to buy <17,0,2 any Samsung product> again.
<0,-1,2 This> is replacing <1,-1,0 my Galaxy S4> and lives up to <2,-1,1 the hype>. <3,2,1 No problems> transferring <4,2,1 phones> with <5,2,1 Consumer Cellular>, I merely took <6,-1,3 the sim card> from <7,1,2 my S4> and put <8,6,2 it> into <9,0,0 the S7> and I was ready to go, <10,2,1 no hassle>. <11,-1,3 Battery life> seems to be much better than <12,1,0 the S4>. Plus I like <13,-1,3 the fingerprint log> in although sometimes <14,13,2 it> won't recognize well <15,2,1 which> makes <16,13,2 it> frustrating. I end up having to use <17,2,1 the draw pattern>. Overall <18,0,2 a nice phone>.
<0,-1,0 This S7> saved me two hundred dollars. I was accidentally pushed into <1,-1,1 a creek> and after taking <2,-1,3 the battery> out and drying <3,2,2 it> for a day <4,0,2 the phone> booted right up. I don't recommend <5,0,2 this> but I had taken <6,-1,3 the charging cover>, <7,6,2 which> seals <8,-1,3 the port> from <9,1,1 water>, off because <10,1,1 it> was hard to remove. The screen shift, home and back <11,1,0 buttons> feel simply awesome and are <12,1,0 a good tradeoff> for <13,1,0 the fingerprint reader>. <14,1,0 The battery life> could be better. <15,-1,3 The screen> could be superb instead of <16,1,1 just good>. But <17,1,1 that>'s <18,1,1 nitpicking>. <19,0,2 This phone> is perfect for someone <20,1,0 who> wants <21,0,2 a good, sim card accessible, removable battery phone>. Someone <22,1,1 who> doesn't want to pay top dollar for <23,0,2 the latest model>. Very happy with <24,0,2 this purchase>.
<0,-1,3 The memory space> on <1,-1,0 this S5> is not expandable; of <2,-1,1 this>, I was not aware. I am <3,2,1 an avid pic taker> and <4,2,1 this> apparently has filled up <5,-1,3 my photos>. <6,2,1 My husband> has <7,2,1 another galaxy phone> he loves. <8,2,1 His> is expandable. <9,-1,3 My camera> has never seemed as great as <10,2,1 the claims> and <11,-1,3 my microphone> is crackly if I am on <12,-1,3 speaker>, therefore I cannot use <13,11,2 it>.
<0,-1,0 The IPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 a huge phone>! <2,0,2 It> can be <3,-1,1 bully> to carry, or even just using <4,0,2 it> in <5,3,1 your hand>. But there are <6,3,1 many features> to out <7,3,1 weight> <8,0,2 this>. Coming from <9,-1,0 the IPhone 5s> I still see <10,3,1 a major increase> in <11,-1,3 CPU and graphics power>. <12,-1,2 Another amazing feature> about <13,0,2 this phone> is <14,12,3 the camera>. Although <15,12,2 it> is <16,3,1 only 8 megapixels>, <17,12,2 it> still can take <18,-1,3 better pictures> than <19,3,1 most> of <20,3,1 its Android competitors>. <21,-1,3 The battery life> on <22,0,2 this phone> is amazing. I can go all day on <23,3,1 heavy use> with lots of <24,3,1 apps>, <25,3,1 web>, and <26,3,1 texting> and still end the day with <27,21,2 40% battery>. Doing <28,3,1 that> on <29,-1,0 my IPhone 5s> was impossible. I would usually have to charge in <30,3,1 the early afternoon> on days like <31,3,1 that>. Since buying <32,0,2 this> I don't feel that I need to use <33,-1,0 my iPad> as much. There are <34,-1,3 some apps> <35,34,2 that> don't work on <36,0,2 the phone> so I have to use <37,33,0 the iPad> but probably at least 75% of <38,3,1 my web> browsing and <39,3,1 amazon shopping> is done on <40,0,2 this device>.
<0,-1,0 The iPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 the best phone> on <2,-1,1 the market>. From <3,2,1 start> to finish, <4,0,2 this phone rocks> all day long. <5,-1,3 The battery life> is great, even with <6,2,1 very heavy use>. <7,-1,3 The camera> is unmatched. <8,7,2 It> may only be <9,2,0 8MP>, but <10,-1,3 the software> makes <11,2,1 a huge difference>. You've seen <12,2,1 all the reviews> on <13,0,2 the device>, so <14,2,1 what> I really want to say is that <15,0,2 it>'s really not too big for <16,2,1 daily use>. When <17,2,1 not compared side> by <18,2,1 side> to <19,2,1 another IPhone>, people constantly believe <20,0,2 it>'s <21,0,2 the smaller version>.
<0,-1,1 Love> <1,-1,0 my IPhone 6Plus>. <2,1,2 It> is a little hard to hold <3,1,2 the phone> in <4,0,1 the right angel> to hear from <5,-1,3 the earpiece> at first. I found myself using <6,-1,3 my Bluetooth> more often now than I ever have. Other than that <7,1,2 this phone> is just so beautiful. <8,-1,3 Picture quality> is great. Watching <9,-1,3 a movie> or browsing on <10,-1,3 the web>, <11,-1,3 photos> and <12,-1,3 video> are excellent. <13,0,1 No issue> with texting with <14,0,1 small hands>. <15,0,1 My daughter> has been using <16,-1,0 my iPad 2> for <17,0,1 a while> and I have <18,0,1 no need> to use <19,16,2 it> now with <20,1,2 this big screen phone>. <21,1,2 It> has <22,-1,3 a very fast processor>, <23,0,1 no regret> at all. Absolutely love <24,1,2 it>.
I can't believe <0,-1,0 this IPhone 6Plus> outperformed <1,-1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7> that <2,0,2 it> is much faster and even <3,-1,3 the camera quality> is much clearer and sharper than <4,1,0 the Samsung Galaxy S7>. Even <5,-1,3 the durability> is so much better than <6,1,0 the Samsung>, not <7,-1,1 a crack or scratch>. <8,-1,3 The screen> is so much bigger and sharper than <9,1,0 the Samsung>, <10,1,0 the Samsung S7> is <11,1,2 a crappy Windows phone> and <12,0,0 the IPhone> has <13,-1,3 more apps>. Even <14,0,2 it> is thinner and lighter. Even <15,-1,3 the speaker> has more bass and much louder than <16,1,0 the Samsung S7>!
<0,-1,0 Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 an amazing phone> for $250. I wanted to get <2,-1,0 the Nexus 6P> but to be honest <3,0,0 the Nexus 6> still does <4,-1,1 an amazing job>. Compare to <5,-1,3 the price> of <6,2,0 the Nexus 6P>, <7,0,2 this> is <8,0,2 a better deal>. <9,-1,3 Fast charging>, <10,-1,3 wireless charging>, <11,-1,3 great speed>, <12,-1,3 amazing display>, <13,-1,3 latest OS marshmallow> <14,4,1 6.0.1> and <15,-1,3 an ok camera>, you can't go wrong with <16,0,2 this phone>. I guess <17,15,2 the biggest con> is <18,15,3 the cameras>, <19,-1,3 rear> is ok but <20,-1,3 the front> is just awful.
<0,-1,0 The Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 a great phone>, but is not for everyone. Firstly, <2,0,2 it> is huge. <3,-1,1 This> is <4,3,1 a reason> I wanted <5,0,2 it>, but can be very unwieldy for <6,3,1 most>. Secondly, <7,0,2 it> runs <8,-1,3 stock Android 6.0> <9,3,1 Marshmallow>. I enjoy <10,-1,3 the clean, simple design> <11,10,2 which> <12,3,1 Google> has created. Many would rather have <13,-1,3 the feature rich skins> <14,13,2 which> <15,3,1 non-Nexus devices ship> with. Other than <16,3,1 these possible set backs>, <17,0,0 the Nexus 6> is <18,0,2 a great flagship device>. <19,0,2 It> contains <20,3,1 all> of <21,3,1 the top specs> expected on <22,0,2 a new phone>. <23,-1,3 The build quality> was quite premium and <24,-1,3 the AMOLED screen> is <25,24,2 a joy> to use. Since <26,-1,3 the price> has been dropping recently, <27,0,2 this> is <28,0,2 an exceptional buy>. If you enjoy <29,8,1 stock Android> and <30,-1,3 ridiculous screen size>, <31,0,2 this> is <32,0,2 the phone> for you.
<0,-1,0 The iPhone 5> is here, and <1,0,2 it>'s arguably <2,-1,2 the biggest change> in <3,-1,1 the series> since <4,-1,0 the iPhone 4> hit <5,3,1 the scene> back. <6,0,0 The iPhone 5> has <7,-1,3 a much faster processor> than <8,4,0 the iPhone 4>. <9,0,2 It> also has <10,-1,3 a new better design> and <11,-1,3 a larger screen>. <12,3,1 Apple> has redesigned <13,-1,3 the lens> - <14,13,2 it>'s now <15,13,3 a Sapphire lens>, <16,13,2 which> should result in <17,-1,3 better image quality> than <18,-1,0 the iPhone 4S> can provide.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S7>'s <1,-1,3 display> is very similar indeed to <2,-1,0 the S6>'s. <3,-1,1 That> means, <4,0,0 the Galaxy S7> has <5,-1,3 a more vibrant and sharp display> than <6,-1,0 the iPhone 6S>. <7,0,2 It> also has <8,-1,3 a faster CPU>, improved <9,-1,3 battery>, and <10,-1,3 a stunning-looking camera>. As <11,3,1 such>, <12,0,0 the Galaxy S7> is a more worthy than <13,6,0 the iPhone 6S>. <14,0,2 It> is <15,0,2 an absolute beast> of <16,0,2 a smartphone> <17,0,2 that> has <18,-1,3 a good design>, <19,-1,3 performance>, and <20,10,3 camera>.
Looking at <0,-1,1 the specs>, <1,-1,0 the iPhone 5S> is a lot less powerful than <2,-1,0 the Galaxy S5>. <3,1,2 It> has <4,-1,3 a dual-core CPU> instead of <5,-1,3 a quad-core> <6,0,1 one>, <7,-1,3 only half the RAM (1GB) and a much slower clock speed>. However, in <8,0,1 reality> <9,1,0 the iPhone 5S> offers <10,-1,3 pretty comparable power>, not least because <11,-1,3 iOS> is generally more efficient and controlled than <12,-1,3 Android>. Much as you might think <13,1,0 the iPhone 5S> is a bit of <14,1,2 a has-been> because <15,1,2 it> has been around for a lot longer than <16,2,0 the Galaxy S5>, but <17,1,2 it>'s actually about as powerful.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. <2,0,2 It>'s <3,0,2 the second one> in <4,-1,1 my household>. There is really <5,4,1 no downside> to <6,0,2 this phone>. I even like <7,0,0 the Note 4> better than <8,-1,0 the Note 5>. <9,0,2 It> is <10,0,2 a fantastic choice> if you don't have <11,4,1 too much money>. Add <12,-1,3 the wireless> charging back and you are good to go. <13,0,0 Note 4> is <14,0,2 the last Note model> to have <15,-1,3 a user replaceable battery>. <16,-1,3 Android Marshmallow> works great on <17,0,2 this device>. I'll be using <18,0,2 this> until <19,0,2 it> falls apart.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 the best smartphone> ever. I did <2,-1,1 a lot research>, and when i saw <3,-1,3 the screen>, I was still amazed at <4,3,0 the gorgeous screen>. <5,3,2 It> is totally unbelievable. I was using <6,-1,0 Galaxy S4> and <7,3,3 the screen> in <8,0,0 Note 4> is so much better. <9,0,0 The Note 4> is so much better in <10,3,3 screen> and in <11,-1,3 camera> than <12,-1,0 the Note 3>. <13,0,2 It> has <14,11,3 a awesome camera quality>. I still think <15,0,2 this> is <16,0,2 the best phone> ever on <17,2,1 market>. I personally like <18,-1,3 the back cover>. <19,18,2 It> is not slippery. Some people say <20,18,2 it> is <21,18,2 cheap plastic>, but I consider <22,18,2 it> to be extremely practical. I had <23,2,1 some slippery phones> before and I always broke <24,2,1 them> by <25,2,1 accident>. <26,0,2 This one> is good. Probably, <27,0,0 the Note 4> is <28,0,2 the last> of <29,2,1 its kind> of <30,2,1 the best Samsung phones>.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> has <1,-1,3 a very clumsy cover>. <2,-1,3 S pen> is <3,2,2 a complete joke>. <4,0,2 It> is <5,0,2 a hit> and miss when <6,0,2 it> works. <7,-1,3 Camera quality> of <8,0,0 Note 4> is a bit better than <9,-1,0 IPhone 3>. But <10,-1,3 The low light camera> of <11,0,2 it> is at <12,-1,1 the worst quality>. I have <13,0,1 7 different phones> at <14,0,1 home> since I am <15,0,1 a developer> and I do not like <16,0,2 this device> over <17,0,1 what> <18,0,2 it> actually do. <19,11,1 Some improvement> has been made on <20,0,1 quality> compared to <21,-1,0 the Note 3> but <22,0,1 it>'s very little. <23,-1,3 Their finger print scanner> is <24,23,2 a hit> and miss. I recommend either <25,0,1 Sony> or <26,0,1 LG> over <27,0,2 this one>.
<0,-1,0 The Lumia> is around 7% slower than <1,-1,0 the HTC Titan II>. In <2,-1,1 fact>, <3,-1,3 its AnTuTu benchmark score> is only about 2.7% slower. <4,2,1 The reason> why <5,0,0 the Lumia> is better than you think is because <6,0,2 it> has <7,-1,3 a higher memory score>. <8,1,0 The Titan II> is slightly higher but <9,2,1 no one>'s going to notice unless you have <10,2,1 them> side-by-side.
I just got <0,-1,0 a Samsung Galaxy S III>. <1,0,0 My S III> has <2,-1,3 a dual core processor>. <3,2,2 It> is <4,2,3 the same processor> you find in <5,-1,0 the LTE HTC One X>. <6,0,0 The Galaxy III> is pretty cool. <7,0,2 It>'s <8,0,2 a plastic phone>, but <9,0,2 it> feels solid even though <10,0,2 it>'s very light. <11,-1,3 The screen> looks great. <12,11,2 It> is very sharp. I don't really notice that <13,11,2 it>'s <14,-1,3 a pentile display> with <15,14,3 the default color scheme>. <16,-1,3 The deep blacks> really give <17,-1,3 the colors> <18,-1,1 a kick>.
<0,-1,0 The One S> has <1,-1,3 a 4.3" display> - <2,1,2 that>'s pretty <3,1,2 standard stuff>. <4,-1,1 What>'s interesting about <5,1,3 this display> is that <6,1,2 it>'s <7,1,3 a Super AMOLED display>. Like <8,-1,0 the One X>, <9,0,0 the One S> has <10,-1,3 a dedicated camera processor> and <11,10,2 it> shows in <12,-1,3 its speed>. <13,10,2 It> focuses really quickly and has <14,12,3 the fastest shot-to-shot speeds> I have ever seen from <15,4,1 a camera phone>. I tested <16,-1,3 the headphone amplifier>. <17,0,0 The One S>'s <18,16,3 headphone amplifier> is slightly louder than <19,8,0 my One X>'s. <20,0,2 It> also has <21,-1,3 a wise sound>.
As far as <0,-1,1 competition>, <1,-1,2 the first phone> <2,1,2 that> come to mind is <3,1,0 the Sony Xperia S>. <4,1,0 The Sony> has <5,-1,3 a camera> with <6,0,1 more megapixels> (though <7,5,2 it>'s not <8,0,1 a very good camera>). On <9,0,1 the other hand>, <10,-1,0 the One S> has <11,-1,3 a much faster processor> than <12,1,0 the Xperia S> . I think <13,10,2 it>'s <14,10,2 a better overall package>. <15,-1,3 Its metal body> is more satisfying to hold while <16,-1,3 the smaller size> makes <17,10,2 it> easier to use. <18,10,0 The One S> has <19,-1,3 a excellent display> than <20,-1,0 One X>. <21,10,2 It> also has <22,-1,3 the better processing power> and <23,-1,3 audio capabilities>. Clearly, <24,10,0 the One S> is <25,0,1 more> than <26,0,1 the sum> of <27,0,1 its parts>.
I find that <0,-1,0 the Galaxy S II HD LTE> is more comfortable to hold than <1,-1,0 the Galaxy Nexus>. However, <2,0,2 it> can get quite hot when there is <3,-1,3 an active LTE data session>. as long as <4,-1,3 the colour> is relatively accurate <5,-1,3 the display> looks just fine to me. Don't forget that <6,-1,3 the screen> has <7,-1,3 a really high resolution>. <8,-1,1 My only complaints> about <9,5,3 the display> are that <10,5,2 it> could be better outdoors or under <11,8,1 bright lights>. In <12,8,1 synthetic benchmarks>, <13,0,0 the Galaxy S II HD LTE> consistently scored lower than <14,1,0 the Galaxy Nexus>. Now I realize that <15,0,2 it> has <16,5,0 a lower resolution display>.
I love <0,-1,0 the Note 4>. I had <1,-1,0 the Note 2> previously and loved <2,1,2 it>. <3,0,0 The Note 4> has <4,-1,1 even more features>. <5,0,0 The Note 4> feels slimmer than <6,1,0 the Note 2>. <7,0,2 It> also fits better in <8,4,1 my hand>. I can't live without <9,-1,3 the stylus> <10,9,2 that> comes with <11,0,0 the Note 4>.
<0,-1,0 Note 4> has <1,-1,1 much better> build <2,1,1 quality> than <3,-1,0 the S5>. I also feel much better to hold <4,0,0 the Note 4> than <5,-1,0 iPhone 6Plus>. <6,-1,3 The display> of <7,0,2 it> is beautiful with <8,-1,3 high resolution>. <9,-1,3 The battery life> is also good, <10,9,2 it> comes easily for a day with <11,0,1 normal usage>. I had <12,5,0 the iPhone 6Plus> also for few days and <13,0,0 the Note 4> has <14,9,3 better battery life> than <15,5,0 the 6Plus>. <16,0,2 It> also has convenient <17,-1,3 expandable memory> and <18,-1,3 replaceable battery>. <19,1,1 Love> <19,0,2 it>!
On to <0,-1,0 the Note 4>. <1,-1,3 The screen> is amazing, <2,-1,3 the resolution> is incredible. <3,-1,3 The camera> is solid, <4,3,2 it> has <5,-1,3 a nice quick shutter speed> and <6,3,2 it> takes <7,-1,3 good pictures> in <8,-1,1 most lighting situations>. <9,-1,3 The sound> is ok, <10,8,1 nothing> amazing but <11,9,2 it>'s enough for <12,-1,3 the speakerphone> to be solid and to hear <13,-1,3 music>. <14,-1,3 The default Samsung keyboard>, <15,14,2 which> is of <16,8,1 course> replaceable, is <17,14,2 one> of <18,8,1 the better stock keyboards>. If you're <19,8,1 a storage buff> then you'll be happy with <20,-1,3 the micro SD card slot>, <21,20,2 it> adds <22,8,1 so much functionality> to <23,0,2 the phone>. I can't think of <24,8,1 a reason> not to recommend <25,0,0 the Note 4>.
Bought <0,-1,0 my Note 4> from <1,-1,1 ATT>. <2,0,2 This phone> is worth <3,1,1 the money>. In <4,1,1 my opinion>, <5,0,0 the Note 4> is definitely better than <6,-1,0 iPhone>. <7,0,2 It> is big with <8,-1,3 a great screen>, <9,-1,3 slim design>, and <10,-1,3 amazing camera>. <11,-1,3 The battery> last all day on <12,1,1 automatic brightness> and when <13,11,3 the battery> does run low, <14,-1,3 the Samsung adaptive charger> charges <15,0,2 the phone> really fast. Overall <16,0,0 the Note 4> is <17,0,2 such a great phone>, I bought <18,1,1 my girl> <19,0,2 this white one>!
I converted from <0,-1,0 my Iphone> to <1,-1,0 the Note 4>. <2,1,0 The Note 4> is gorgeous, works great, and has some of <3,-1,1 the best specs> on <4,3,1 the market>. I love <5,1,2 this phone> and am glad I bought <6,1,2 it> at <7,3,1 Amazon>. <8,1,0 The Note 4> is much more wonderful than <9,-1,0 IPhone 6Plus> <10,9,2 which> I took back. <11,1,2 It> just can do <12,3,1 so many great things>.
Before upgrading to <0,-1,0 this Note 4>, I had <1,-1,0 the Galaxy S5>. I was very satisfied with <2,1,0 my Galaxy S5>, but I knew I would benefit from <3,-1,3 the larger screen and S pen> that <4,0,0 the Note 4> has to offer. Right when I took <5,0,2 this phone> out of <6,-1,1 the box>, <7,6,1 the feel> of <8,0,0 the Note 4> in <9,6,1 my hand> felt much more solid than <10,1,0 the Galaxy S5>. I love <11,-1,3 the matte> trim and <12,6,1 the leather> back <13,-1,3 cover> of <14,0,2 this phone>. After using <15,0,2 it> for a few days now, I absolutely love <16,0,2 it>. <17,-1,3 The display> is much more vibrant and <18,-1,3 the screen> is very responsive. <19,-1,3 The S pen> comes in handy when taking <20,6,1 notes>. I realized that <21,-1,3 the camera> was much better than <22,1,0 the Galaxy S5>. <23,21,2 It> is now much easier to focus on <24,6,1 close objects>. <25,0,0 Note 4> is <26,0,2 definitely one> of <27,6,1 the best Android devices> you can buy right now.
<0,-1,0 The iPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 a huge phone>! <2,0,2 It> can be <3,0,2 bully> to carry, or even just using <4,0,2 it> in <5,-1,1 your hand>. But there are <6,5,1 many features> to out weigh <7,0,2 this>. I still see that <8,0,0 the iPhone 6Plus> has <9,-1,3 a better graphics power> than <10,-1,0 the iPhone 5s>. <11,-1,3 Another amazing feature> about <12,0,2 this phone> is <13,11,3 the camera>. Although <14,11,2 it> is <15,5,1 only 8 megapixels>, <16,11,2 it> still can take <17,-1,3 better pictures> than <18,5,1 most> of <19,11,2 it>'s <20,5,1 Android competitors>. <21,-1,3 The larger pixels> allow for <22,5,1 more light> to enter <23,-1,3 the sensor and optical image stabilization>. <24,-1,3 The battery life> on <25,0,2 this phone> is amazing. I can go all day on <26,5,1 heavy use> with lots of <27,-1,3 apps>. Doing <28,5,1 that> on <29,10,0 my 5s> was impossible.
<0,-1,0 The Iphone 6Plus> has <1,-1,3 a good price and functionality>, except <2,-1,3 sound volume>. <3,-1,3 Decent price>. <4,-1,3 The volume> of <5,0,0 iPhone 6Plus> is <6,-1,1 less> than <7,-1,0 my 4s> <8,7,2 which> had <9,-1,3 awesome clarity>. However, I love <10,0,2 this phone>.
I bought <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6> to replace <1,-1,0 my previous Xperia Z3> <2,1,2 which> broke and wasn't worth fixing. I was really interested in <3,0,2 a 6 inch phone> with <4,-1,3 a 1440p screen>. <5,0,2 The Nexus 6> is definitely <6,0,2 the biggest phone> I have ever used, <7,0,2 it> would be considered <8,0,2 a tablet>. <9,0,2 It> is only slightly bigger than <10,-1,0 the Oneplus One>. I have <11,-1,1 medium sized hands> and didn't have <12,11,1 any issues> with carrying <13,0,2 the phone>. I was able to use <14,0,2 it> with <15,11,0 one hand> without <16,11,1 too much trouble> <17,11,1 which> was unexpected. In <18,11,1 my opinion>, <19,0,0 the Nexus 6> had <20,-1,3 the best colors> of <21,11,1 the phones> with <22,-1,3 its Amoled>. With <23,4,3 the 1440p screen>, <24,11,1 it> was impossible for me to see <25,11,1 the pixels>, even when putting <26,4,2 it> right in <27,11,1 front> of <28,11,1 my eyes>. <29,0,0 The Nexus 6> has <30,-1,3 good performance>. <31,0,0 The Nexus 6> should perform better than <32,1,0 the Z3>. However, I do <33,11,1 issues> with <34,11,1 navigation> of <35,-1,3 the operating system> where <36,35,2 it> seems to slow down. <37,-1,3 The audio> for <38,0,2 the phone> is <39,37,2 ok>. <40,37,2 It> wasn't <41,11,1 anything> special, but isn't terrible either. <42,-1,3 The external speakers> were better than <43,1,0 my Z3>. With <44,-1,3 headphone>, <45,42,2 it> is decent as well. <46,0,0 The Nexus 6> is definitely better than <47,1,0 the Z3> <48,1,2 which> suffered from <49,-1,3 very low volumes>. <50,0,2 It> is about equal to <51,-1,0 the Oneplus One> though. <52,-1,0 The M9> destroyed <53,0,0 the Nexus 6> in both <54,11,1 aspects>. <55,-1,3 The battery life> was pretty good. <56,55,2 It> wasn't as good as <57,51,2 the Oneplus One>, but was much better than <58,52,0 the M9>. <59,4,3 The 1440p screen> probably uses <60,11,1 more power> to use. Overall, I was satisfied with <61,0,0 the Nexus 6>. <62,11,1 My only issue> with <63,0,2 it> was <64,11,2 the non-smooth navigation> I was having, and <65,37,3 the audio> from <66,44,3 the headphone>. I would recommend <67,0,2 this phone> to people <68,11,1 who> are looking for <69,0,2 a "phablet>".
<0,-1,0 The Lumia 800> is a lot smaller than <1,-1,0 many top-of-the-line Android devices> and I must say, <2,0,2 it> really fits nicely in <3,1,1 my hand>. <4,-1,3 The finish> is quite smooth. <5,-1,3 The display> appears to be <6,5,3 a super AMOLED display>. While <7,0,0 the Lumia 800> has <8,-1,3 a pentile matrix>, I don't usually notice <9,8,2 it> because <10,-1,3 the pixel density> of <11,0,0 the 800>'s <12,5,3 display> is pretty high so <13,5,2 the dottiness> isn't really noticeable. <14,-1,3 The camera> has <15,-1,3 a 8mp sensor> along with <16,-1,3 a LED flash>. <17,14,3 The camera> isn't as good as <18,-1,0 the iPhone 4s>' but <19,14,2 it>'s still decent.
I Purchased <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> from <1,-1,1 Amazon>. Was said to have had <2,1,1 several scratches and scuffs> on <3,0,2 it>. I bought <4,0,2 it> to replace <5,-1,0 my Galaxy S6 Edge> that I was growing tired of. Granted on <6,1,1 paper>, <7,5,0 the Edge> is better than <8,0,0 the Nexus 6>. But after having <9,1,1 it> for one day so far, <10,0,0 everything> about <11,0,0 the Nexus 6> seems snappier and faster than <12,5,0 my former Edge>. I'm very pleased with <13,0,2 the device>.
By far and away, <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 the best Android phone> I have had. <2,0,0 The Nexus 6> is much better than <3,-1,0 the iPhone 6Plus>. <4,0,2 It> does <5,-1,1 everything>, very well. <6,0,2 It>'s big, fast, plenty of <7,-1,3 RAM>, and plenty of <8,-1,3 storage space>.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> from <1,-1,0 an S4>. <2,-1,1 Love> <3,0,0 this Nexus 6>, I got <4,0,2 it> on Black Friday. <5,0,2 It>'s <6,0,2 my first Nexus> and I feel special. <7,2,1 Only thing> <8,2,1 that bug> me just a bit is that <9,-1,3 the front facing camera> doesn't do well in <10,2,1 low>. <11,0,0 The Nexus 6> is not better than <12,1,0 my s4>. However, <13,0,2 it> does take <14,-1,3 better pictures> in <15,2,1 normal lighting>. Overall, I'm very happy with <16,0,0 Nexus 6>. <17,2,1 My girlfriend> got <18,0,2 one> too for <19,2,1 Verizon>. If you already have <20,-1,3 a nano Sim>, just pop <21,20,2 it> in.
<0,-1,0 My Nexus 5> was dropped into <1,-1,1 water> so I have to buy <2,-1,2 a new one>. I choose <3,2,0 the Nexus 6>. I really love <4,2,1 it>! <5,-1,3 The screen> is much big. <6,-1,3 The camera> of <7,2,0 the Nexus 6> is much better than <8,0,0 the Nexus 5>. <9,2,2 It> is <10,2,2 a good deal>!
I would rate <0,-1,0 the Q10> <1,-1,1 five stars> but <2,-1,3 the camera quality> sucks. <3,0,2 It> has <4,2,3 a 2MP camera> like <5,1,1 the one> I owned before. I like that <6,0,0 the Q10> has a built in <7,-1,3 FM radio> where you just plug in <8,-1,3 headphones> and <9,7,2 it> works. I also like <10,-1,3 the flashlight>. <11,10,2 It> is strong. I like that <12,0,2 the phone> is smaller. Wherever someone says that <13,-1,3 the battery> sucks is wrong. <14,0,2 The Q10> has <15,1,1 all> of <16,1,1 the wrong descriptons> everywhere. Just listen to <17,0,2 this best phone> ever.
I don't like where <0,-1,3 the power button> of <1,-1,0 Lumia 920> is.  <2,-1,3 The battery life> is rather poor.  I charge <3,1,2 it> <4,-1,1 every night> and still have had <5,1,2 it> die on my twice in <6,4,1 less> than a month. <7,1,0 Lumia 920> takes <8,-1,3 great pictures>.  <9,-1,3 The screen> is very sharp and <10,4,1 it> is easy to watch <11,-1,3 videos> on. However, I want to admit <12,1,0 Lumia 920> is by far better than <13,-1,0 the iPhone>! Learn how to use, and <14,1,2 it>'s amazing!
I purchased <0,-1,0 this Tracfone LG840G> a few months ago. <1,0,2 It> really eats up <2,-1,3 the battery>. I have to charge <3,0,2 it> every day. <4,-1,3 The screen> leaves a lot to be desired because of <5,4,2 it> not being <6,-1,3 super fine resolution>, but <7,4,2 it> is clear enough. <8,-1,3 The camera> is <9,-1,1 only 2 megapixel> and I thought that <10,8,2 it> would be <11,8,2 poor quality>, but even on <12,9,1 the computer>, <13,-1,3 the photos> look decent. <14,0,0 This Tracfone LG840G> is <15,0,2 just an inexpensive phone> with <16,9,1 decent features>. Good enough for me, but I will certainly try <17,9,1 something> different when <18,0,2 this one> dies. If you have <19,9,1 any questions> I will try to answer <20,9,1 them>.
I have <0,-1,1 some problems> with <1,-1,0 the LG 800G>, so I ordered <2,-1,0 this Tracfone>.  <3,2,0 The Tracfone> is easier to use than <4,1,0 the 800G>.  I have had <5,0,1 no problems> with <6,2,2 this one>.  I should have bought <7,2,2 it> first.
I was using <0,-1,0 the LG 800G> for <1,-1,1 a while> and I was very annoyed by <2,-1,3 the poor touch screen>. I was over <3,1,1 the fence> whether upgrading to <4,-1,0 this newer LG 840G> or not. Since <5,-1,3 the price> of <6,4,0 the LG 840G> has dropped quite a lot recently and so I decided to give <7,4,2 it> try. Wow, I am so delighted to say that <8,4,0 this LG 840G> is <9,4,2 a much better touch screen phone> than <10,0,0 the LG 800G>. <11,4,2 It> is very responsive and <12,-1,3 the texting> is so much easier. If you are considering <13,4,0 this LG 840G>, don't waste your time just buy <14,4,2 it>. You'll love <15,4,2 it>.
