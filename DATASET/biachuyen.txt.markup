<0,-1,0 The iPhone 5> is here, and <1,0,2 it>'s arguably <2,-1,2 the biggest change> in <3,-1,1 the series> since <4,-1,0 the iPhone 4> hit <5,3,1 the scene> back. <6,0,0 The iPhone 5> has <7,-1,3 a much faster processor> than <8,4,0 the iPhone 4>. <9,0,2 It> also has <10,-1,3 a new better design> and <11,-1,3 a larger screen>. <12,3,1 Apple> has redesigned <13,-1,3 the lens> - <14,13,2 it>'s now <15,13,3 a Sapphire lens>, <16,13,2 which> should result in <17,-1,3 better image quality> than <18,-1,0 the iPhone 4S> can provide.
<0,-1,0 The Samsung Galaxy S7>'s <1,-1,3 display> is very similar indeed to <2,-1,0 the S6>'s. <3,-1,1 That> means, <4,0,0 the Galaxy S7> has <5,-1,3 a more vibrant and sharp display> than <6,-1,0 the iPhone 6S>. <7,0,2 It> also has <8,-1,3 a faster CPU>, improved <9,-1,3 battery>, and <10,-1,3 a stunning-looking camera>. As <11,3,1 such>, <12,0,0 the Galaxy S7> is a more than <13,0,2 worthy rival> to <14,6,0 the iPhone 6S>. <15,0,2 It> is <16,0,2 an absolute beast> of <17,0,2 a smartphone> <18,0,2 that> has <19,-1,3 a good design>, <20,-1,3 performance>, and <21,10,3 camera>.
Looking at <0,-1,1 the specs>, <1,-1,0 the iPhone 5S> is a lot less powerful than <2,-1,0 the Galaxy S5>. <3,1,2 It> has <4,-1,3 a dual-core CPU> instead of <5,-1,3 a quad-core> <6,0,1 one>, <7,-1,3 only half the RAM (1GB) and a much slower clock speed>. However, in <8,0,1 reality> <9,1,0 the iPhone 5S> offers <10,-1,3 pretty comparable power>, not least because <11,-1,3 iOS> is generally more efficient and controlled than <12,-1,3 Android>. Much as you might think <13,1,0 the iPhone 5S> is a bit of <14,1,2 a has-been> because <15,1,2 it> has been around for a lot longer than <16,2,0 the Galaxy S5>, but <17,1,2 it>'s actually about as powerful.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 a great phone>. <2,0,2 It>'s <3,0,2 the second one> in <4,-1,1 my household>. There is really <5,4,1 no downside> to <6,0,2 this phone>. I even like <7,0,0 the Note 4> better than <8,-1,0 the Note 5>. <9,0,2 It> is <10,0,2 a fantastic choice> if you don't have <11,4,1 too much money>. Add <12,-1,3 the wireless> charging back and you are good to go. <13,0,0 Note 4> is <14,0,2 the last Note model> to have <15,-1,3 a user replaceable battery>. <16,-1,3 Android Marshmallow> works great on <17,0,2 this device>. I'll be using <18,0,2 this> until <19,0,2 it> falls apart.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> is <1,0,2 the best smartphone> ever. I did <2,-1,1 a lot research>, and when i saw <3,-1,3 the screen>, I was still amazed at <4,3,0 the gorgeous screen>. <5,3,2 It> is totally unbelievable. I was using <6,-1,0 Galaxy S4> and <7,3,3 the screen> in <8,0,0 Note 4> is so much better. <9,0,0 The Note 4> is so much better in <10,3,3 screen> and in <11,-1,3 camera> than <12,-1,0 the Note 3>. <13,0,2 It> has <14,11,3 a awesome camera quality>. I still think <15,0,2 this> is <16,0,2 the best phone> ever on <17,2,1 market>. I personally like <18,-1,3 the back cover>. <19,18,2 It> is not slippery. Some people say <20,18,2 it> is <21,18,2 cheap plastic>, but I consider <22,18,2 it> to be extremely practical. I had <23,2,1 some slippery phones> before and I always broke <24,2,1 them> by <25,2,1 accident>. <26,0,2 This one> is good. Probably, <27,0,0 the Note 4> is <28,0,2 the last> of <29,2,1 its kind> of <30,2,1 the best Samsung phones>.
<0,-1,0 The Note 4> has <1,-1,3 a very clumsy cover>. <2,-1,3 S pen> is <3,2,2 a complete joke>. <4,2,2 It> is <5,-1,1 a hit> and miss when <6,2,2 it> works. <7,-1,3 Camera quality> of <8,0,0 Note 4> is a bit better than <9,-1,0 IPhone 3>. <10,7,2 It>'s <11,7,3 low light camera> is at <12,7,2 the worst quality>. I have <13,-1,1 7 different phones> at <14,13,1 home> since I am <15,13,1 a developer> and I do not like <16,0,2 this device> over <17,13,1 what> <18,0,2 it> actually do. <19,13,1 Some improvement> has been made on <20,13,1 quality> compared to <21,-1,0 the Note 3> but <22,5,1 it>'s very little. <23,-1,3 Their finger print scanner> is <24,5,1 a hit> and miss. I recommend either <25,5,1 Sony> or <26,5,1 LG> over <27,0,2 this one>.
<0,-1,0 The Lumia> is around 7% slower than <1,-1,0 the HTC Titan II>. In <2,-1,1 fact>, <3,0,2 it>'s <4,2,1 AnTuTu benchmark score> is only about 2.7% slower. <5,2,1 The reason> why <6,0,0 the Lumia> is better than you think is because <7,0,2 it> has <8,-1,3 a higher memory score>. <9,1,0 The Titan II> is slightly higher but <10,2,1 no one>'s going to notice unless you have <11,2,1 them> side-by-side.
I just got <0,-1,0 a Samsung Galaxy S III>. <1,0,0 My S III> has <2,-1,3 a dual core processor>. <3,2,2 It> is <4,2,3 the same processor> you find in <5,-1,0 the LTE HTC One X>. <6,0,0 The Galaxy III> is pretty cool. <7,0,2 It>'s <8,0,2 a plastic phone>, but <9,0,2 it> feels solid even though <10,0,2 it>'s very light. <11,-1,3 The screen> looks great. <12,11,2 It> is very sharp. I don't really notice that <13,11,2 it>'s <14,-1,3 a pentile display> with <15,14,3 the default color scheme>. <16,-1,3 The deep blacks> really give <17,-1,3 the colors> <18,-1,1 a kick>.
<0,-1,0 The One S> has <1,-1,3 a 4.3" display> - <2,1,2 that>'s pretty <3,1,2 standard stuff>. <4,-1,1 What>'s interesting about <5,1,3 this display> is that <6,1,2 it>'s <7,1,3 a Super AMOLED display>. Like <8,-1,0 the One X>, <9,0,0 the One S> has <10,-1,3 a dedicated camera processor> and <11,10,2 it> shows in <12,-1,3 its speed>. <13,10,2 It> focuses really quickly and has <14,12,3 the fastest shot-to-shot speeds> I have ever seen from <15,4,1 a camera phone>. I tested <16,-1,3 the headphone amplifier>. <17,0,0 The One S>'s <18,16,3 headphone amplifier> is slightly louder than <19,8,0 my One X>'s. <20,0,2 It> also has <21,-1,3 a wise sound>.
As far as <0,-1,1 competition>, <1,-1,2 the first phone> <2,1,2 that> come to mind is <3,1,0 the Sony Xperia S>. <4,1,0 The Sony> has <5,-1,3 a camera> with <6,0,1 more megapixels> (though <7,5,2 it>'s not <8,0,1 a very good camera>). On <9,0,1 the other hand>, <10,-1,0 the One S> has <11,-1,3 a much faster processor> than <12,1,0 the Xperia S.> I think <13,10,2 it>'s <14,10,2 a better overall package>. <15,-1,3 Its metal body> is more satisfying to hold while <16,-1,3 the smaller size> makes <17,10,2 it> easier to use. <18,10,0 The One S> has <19,-1,3 a excellent display> than <20,-1,0 One X>. <21,10,2 It> also has <22,-1,3 the better processing power> and <23,-1,3 audio capabilities>. Clearly, <24,10,0 the One S> is <25,0,1 more> than <26,0,1 the sum> of <27,0,1 its parts>.
I find that <0,-1,0 the Galaxy S II HD LTE> is more comfortable to hold than <1,-1,0 the Galaxy Nexus>. However, <2,0,2 it> can get quite hot when there is <3,-1,3 an active LTE data session>. as long as <4,-1,3 the colour> is relatively accurate <5,-1,3 the display> looks just fine to me. Don't forget that <6,-1,3 the screen> has <7,-1,3 a really high resolution>. <8,-1,1 My only complaints> about <9,5,3 the display> are that <10,5,2 it> could be better outdoors or under <11,8,1 bright lights>. In <12,8,1 synthetic benchmarks>, <13,0,0 the Galaxy S II HD LTE> consistently scored lower than <14,1,0 the Galaxy Nexus>. Now I realize that <15,0,2 it> has <16,5,0 a lower resolution display>.
I love <0,-1,0 the Note 4>. I had <1,-1,0 the Note 2> previously and loved <2,1,2 it>. <3,0,0 The Note 4> has <4,-1,1 even more features>. <5,0,0 The Note 4> feels slimmer than <6,1,0 the Note 2>. <7,0,2 It> also fits better in <8,4,1 my hand>. I can't live without <9,-1,3 the stylus> <10,9,2 that> comes with <11,0,0 the Note 4>.
<0,-1,0 Note 4> has <1,-1,1 much better> build <2,1,1 quality> than <3,-1,0 the S5>. I feel much better to hold <4,0,2 it> than <5,-1,0 iPhone 6Plus>. <6,-1,3 The display> is beatiful with <7,-1,3 high resolution>. <8,-1,3 The battery life> is also good, <9,8,2 it> comes easily for a day with <10,1,1 normal usage>. I had <11,5,0 the iPhone 6Plus> also for few days and <12,0,0 the Note 4> has <13,8,3 better battery life> than <14,5,0 the 6Plus>. <15,0,2 It> also has <16,-1,3 expandable memory> and <17,-1,3 replaceable battery>. <18,1,1 Love> <19,0,2 it>!
On to <0,-1,0 the Note 4>. <1,-1,3 The screen> is amazing, <2,-1,3 the resolution> is incredible. <3,-1,3 The camera> is solid, <4,3,2 it> has <5,-1,3 a nice quick shutter speed> and <6,3,2 it> takes <7,-1,3 good pictures> in <8,-1,1 most lighting situations>. <9,-1,3 The sound> is ok, <10,8,1 nothing> amazing but <11,9,2 it>'s enough for <12,-1,3 the speakerphone> to be solid and to hear <13,-1,3 music>. <14,-1,3 The default Samsung keyboard>, <15,14,2 which> is of <16,8,1 course> replaceable, is <17,14,2 one> of <18,8,1 the better stock keyboards>. If you're <19,8,1 a storage buff> then you'll be happy with <20,-1,3 the micro SD card slot>, <21,20,2 it> adds <22,8,1 so much functionality> to <23,0,2 the phone>. I can't think of <24,8,1 a reason> not to recommend <25,0,0 the Note 4>.
Bought <0,-1,0 my Note 4> from <1,-1,1 ATT>. <2,0,2 This phone> is worth <3,1,1 the money>. In <4,1,1 my opinion>, <5,0,0 the Note 4> is definitely better than <6,-1,0 iPhone>. <7,0,2 It> is big with <8,-1,3 a great screen>, <9,-1,3 slim design>, and <10,-1,3 amazing camera>. <11,-1,3 The battery> last all day on <12,1,1 automatic brightness> and when <13,11,3 the battery> does run low, <14,-1,3 the Samsung adaptive charger> charges <15,0,2 the phone> really fast. Overall <16,0,0 the Note 4> is <17,0,2 such a great phone>, I bought <18,1,1 my girl> <19,0,2 this white one>!
I converted from <0,-1,0 my Iphone> to <1,-1,0 the Note 4>. <2,1,0 The Note 4> is gorgeous, works great, and has some of <3,-1,1 the best specs> on <4,3,1 the market>. I love <5,1,2 this phone> and am glad I bought <6,1,2 it> at <7,3,1 Amazon>. <8,1,0 The Note 4> is <9,1,2 much more phone> than <10,-1,0 IPhone 6Plus> <11,10,2 which> I took back. <12,1,2 It> just can do <13,3,1 so many great things>.
Before upgrading to <0,-1,0 this Note 4>, I had <1,-1,0 the Galaxy S5>. I was very satisfied with <2,1,0 my Galaxy S5>, but I knew I would benefit from <3,-1,3 the larger screen and S pen> that <4,0,0 the Note 4> has to offer. Right when I took <5,0,2 this phone> out of <6,-1,1 the box>, <7,6,1 the feel> of <8,0,0 the Note 4> in <9,6,1 my hand> felt much more solid than <10,1,0 the Galaxy S5>. I love <11,-1,3 the matte> trim and <12,6,1 the leather> back <13,-1,3 cover> of <14,0,2 this phone>. After using <15,0,2 it> for a few days now, I absolutely love <16,0,2 it>. <17,-1,3 The display> is much more vibrant and <18,-1,3 the screen> is very responsive. <19,-1,3 The S pen> comes in handy when taking <20,6,1 notes>. I realized that <21,-1,3 the camera> was much better than <22,1,0 the Galaxy S5>. <23,21,2 It> is now much easier to focus on <24,6,1 close objects>. <25,0,0 Note 4> is <26,0,2 definitely one> of <27,6,1 the best Android devices> you can buy right now.
<0,-1,0 The iPhone 6Plus> is <1,0,2 a huge phone>! <2,0,2 It> can be <3,0,2 bully> to carry, or even just using <4,0,2 it> in <5,-1,1 your hand>. But there are <6,5,1 many features> to out weigh <7,0,2 this>. I still see that <8,0,0 the iPhone 6Plus> has <9,-1,3 a better graphics power> than <10,-1,0 the iPhone 5s>. <11,-1,3 Another amazing feature> about <12,0,2 this phone> is <13,11,3 the camera>. Although <14,11,2 it> is <15,5,1 only 8 megapixels>, <16,11,2 it> still can take <17,-1,3 better pictures> than <18,5,1 most> of <19,11,2 it>'s <20,5,1 Android competitors>. <21,-1,3 The larger pixels> allow for <22,5,1 more light> to enter <23,-1,3 the sensor and optical image stabilization>. <24,-1,3 The battery life> on <25,0,2 this phone> is amazing. I can go all day on <26,5,1 heavy use> with lots of <27,-1,3 apps>. Doing <28,5,1 that> on <29,10,0 my 5s> was impossible.
<0,-1,0 The Iphone 6Plus> has <1,-1,3 a good price and functionality>, except <2,-1,3 sound volume>. <3,-1,3 Decent price>. <4,-1,3 The volume> of <5,0,0 iPhone 6Plus> is <6,-1,1 less> than <7,-1,0 my 4s> <8,7,2 which> had <9,-1,3 awesome clarity>. However, I love <10,0,2 this phone>.
I bought <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6> to replace <1,-1,0 my previous Xperia Z3> <2,1,2 which> broke and wasn't worth fixing. I was really interested in <3,0,2 a 6 inch phone> with <4,-1,3 a 1440p screen>. <5,0,2 The Nexus 6> is definitely <6,0,2 the biggest phone> I have ever used, <7,0,2 it> would be considered <8,0,2 a tablet>. <9,0,2 It> is only slightly bigger than <10,-1,0 the Oneplus One>. I have <11,-1,1 medium sized hands> and didn't have <12,11,1 any issues> with carrying <13,0,2 the phone>. I was able to use <14,0,2 it> with <15,11,0 one hand> without <16,11,1 too much trouble> <17,11,1 which> was unexpected. In <18,11,1 my opinion>, <19,0,0 the Nexus 6> had <20,-1,3 the best colors> of <21,11,1 the phones> with <22,-1,3 its Amoled>. With <23,4,3 the 1440p screen>, <24,11,1 it> was impossible for me to see <25,11,1 the pixels>, even when putting <26,4,2 it> right in <27,11,1 front> of <28,11,1 my eyes>. <29,0,0 The Nexus 6> has <30,-1,3 good performance>. <31,0,0 The Nexus 6> should perform better than <32,1,0 the Z3>. However, I do <33,11,1 issues> with <34,11,1 navigation> of <35,-1,3 the operating system> where <36,35,2 it> seems to slow down. <37,-1,3 The audio> for <38,0,2 the phone> is <39,37,2 ok>. <40,37,2 It> wasn't <41,11,1 anything> special, but isn't terrible either. <42,-1,3 The external speakers> were better than <43,1,0 my Z3>. With <44,-1,3 headphone>, <45,42,2 it> is decent as well. <46,0,0 The Nexus 6> is definitely better than <47,1,0 the Z3> <48,1,2 which> suffered from <49,-1,3 very low volumes>. <50,0,2 It> is about equal to <51,-1,0 the Oneplus One> though. <52,-1,0 The M9> destroyed <53,0,0 the Nexus 6> in both <54,11,1 aspects>. <55,-1,3 The battery life> was pretty good. <56,55,2 It> wasn't as good as <57,51,2 the Oneplus One>, but was much better than <58,52,0 the M9>. <59,4,3 The 1440p screen> probably uses <60,11,1 more power> to use. Overall, I was satisfied with <61,0,0 the Nexus 6>. <62,11,1 My only issue> with <63,0,2 it> was <64,11,2 the non-smooth navigation> I was having, and <65,37,3 the audio> from <66,44,3 the headphone>. I would recommend <67,0,2 this phone> to people <68,11,1 who> are looking for <69,0,2 a "phablet>".
<0,-1,0 The Lumia 800> is a lot smaller than <1,-1,0 many top-of-the-line Android devices> and I must say, <2,0,2 it> really fits nicely in <3,1,1 my hand>. <4,-1,3 The finish> is quite smooth. <5,-1,3 The display> appears to be <6,5,3 a super AMOLED display>. While <7,0,0 the Lumia 800> has <8,-1,3 a pentile matrix>, I don't usually notice <9,8,2 it> because <10,-1,3 the pixel density> of <11,0,0 the 800>'s <12,5,3 display> is pretty high so <13,5,2 the dottiness> isn't really noticeable. <14,-1,3 The camera> has <15,-1,3 a 8mp sensor> along with <16,-1,3 a LED flash>. <17,14,3 The camera> isn't as good as <18,-1,0 the iPhone 4s>' but <19,14,2 it>'s still decent.
I Purchased <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> from <1,-1,1 Amazon>. Was said to have had <2,1,1 several scratches and scuffs> on <3,0,2 it>. I bought <4,0,2 it> to replace <5,-1,0 my Galaxy S6 Edge> that I was growing tired of. Granted on <6,1,1 paper>, <7,5,0 the Edge> is better than <8,0,2 the Nexus 6>. But after having <9,1,1 it> for one day so far, <10,0,0 everything> about <11,0,0 the Nexus 6> seems snappier and faster than <12,5,0 my former Edge>. I'm very pleased with <13,0,2 the device>.
By far and away, <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> is <1,0,2 the best Android phone> I have had. <2,0,0 The Nexus 6> is much better than <3,-1,0 the iPhone 6Plus>. <4,0,2 It> does <5,-1,1 everything>, very well. <6,0,2 It>'s big, fast, plenty of <7,-1,3 RAM>, and plenty of <8,-1,3 storage space>.
I upgraded to <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> from <1,-1,0 an S4>. <2,-1,1 Love> <3,0,0 this Nexus 6>, I got <4,0,2 it> on Black Friday. <5,0,2 It>'s <6,0,2 my first Nexus> and I feel special. <7,2,1 Only thing> <8,2,1 that bug> me just a bit is that <9,-1,3 the front facing camera> doesn't do well in <10,2,1 low>. <11,0,0 The Nexus 6> is not better than <12,1,0 my s4>. However, <13,0,2 it> does take <14,-1,3 better pictures> in <15,2,1 normal lighting>. Overall, I'm very happy with <16,0,0 Nexus 6>. <17,2,1 My girlfriend> got <18,0,2 one> too for <19,2,1 Verizon>. If you already have <20,-1,3 a nano Sim>, just pop <21,20,2 it> in.
<0,-1,0 My Nexus 5> was dropped into <1,-1,1 water> so I have to buy <2,-1,2 a new one>. I choose <3,2,0 the Nexus 6>. I really love <4,2,1 it>! <5,-1,3 The screen> is much big. <6,-1,3 The camera> of <7,2,0 the Nexus 6> is much better than <8,0,0 the Nexus 5>. <9,2,2 It> is <10,2,2 a good deal>!
I've been using <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6> for about 4 weeks and I have to write to say that I love <1,0,2 this phone> completely. <2,0,2 It> is big and I love <3,-1,3 the front facing stereo speakers>. <4,0,0 This Nexus 6> beats <5,-1,0 the S4 hands> down, of <6,-1,1 course>, and <7,0,0 the Nexus 6> is better than <8,-1,0 the OnePlus One>. I'm pleased with <9,0,2 this phone>.
I don't even know where to start, I love <0,-1,1 everything> about <1,-1,0 this Nexus 6>. <2,1,2 It> makes <3,-1,0 my old Samsung galaxy S4 look> and feel like <4,3,2 a joke>. <5,-1,3 Excellent battery life>, and I mean excellent. <6,-1,3 Beautiful screen>. <7,-1,3 Quality dual speakers>. <8,-1,3 Impressive camera>. Honestly, <9,-1,0 the Nexus 6P> is worse than <10,1,0 the Nexus 6>. I use <11,9,2 this phone>, and I couldn't be happier.
I love <0,-1,0 this Nexus 6>! I got <1,0,2 it> a few weeks ago. <2,0,0 The Nexus 6> is so much better than <3,-1,0 my Galaxy S4>. <4,0,2 It> runs <5,-1,3 Android> very smoothly and <6,-1,3 the screen size> is amazing. I had to get used to <7,0,0 the Nexus 6> but having <8,-1,3 a 6 inch screen> makes <9,0,2 it> so much easier to <10,-1,1 type emails> and see <11,10,1 apps>. I am very glad I got <12,0,2 this phone> and would recommend <13,0,2 it> to anyone <14,10,1 who> is looking and trying to figure out <15,10,1 what kind> of <16,10,1 phone> <17,10,1 they> want. I also love how fast <18,10,1 the charging> is with <19,-1,3 the charger>. <20,0,2 The phone> can be very low on <21,-1,3 battery> and charge up to <22,10,1 full> in less than 2 hours. So far, <23,0,2 it> is <24,0,2 an amazing phone>!
<0,-1,0 Nexus 6> is awesome, but <1,-1,1 the reason> for <2,1,1 the 4 stars> is that there is <3,-1,3 no Wifi> calling, <4,3,2 which> is <5,3,2 a feature> <6,3,2 that> is available if purchased through <7,1,1 TMobile>. Where we live, <8,3,2 it>'s almost essential, so not having that <9,3,2 feature> meant a lot to us. If <10,3,2 that>'s not important, <11,0,2 it> is <12,0,2 a wonderful phone>. <13,-1,3 Screen> is crystal clear and <14,-1,3 the calls> of <15,0,0 Nexus 6> are a lot crisper than <16,-1,0 the Nexus 5>. <17,0,2 Great phone>!
I purchased <0,-1,0 the Nexus 6> after having <1,-1,1 continued issues> with <2,-1,0 my Samsung Note>. <3,2,0 My Note> had reached <4,1,1 its limit>. I've been using <5,0,0 the Nexus 6> for about three days. <6,0,2 It> is <7,1,1 lightning> fast compared to <8,2,0 the Note>. <9,0,0 The Nexus 6> is a little faster than <10,-1,0 the Blackberry Passport> I use for <11,1,1 work>. <12,0,2 It> really works well <13,1,1 the streaming data>. And <14,0,0 the Nexus 6> makes <15,-1,3 calls> and picks up <16,-1,3 signal> better than <17,2,0 the Note>. <18,0,2 It> holds <19,-1,3 a charge> well, but I do find myself charging when I get home from <20,1,1 work>. But with <21,-1,3 the super fast charging>, <22,0,2 it>'s really <23,0,2 no big deal>. <24,-1,3 The camera> is decent enough. <25,-1,3 Pictures> are decent but <26,-1,3 the interface> is <27,26,2 a little clunky>. In general, I really love <28,0,2 this device>.
<0,-1,3 A 4.5" display> sounds nice on <1,-1,1 paper> but for me <2,0,2 it>'s too big. <3,1,1 The problem> is, that I prefer to use <4,-1,2 my phone> with <5,1,1 one hand>. <6,1,1 It>'s <7,1,1 one> of <8,1,1 the reasons> why I like to use <9,-1,0 an iPhone>. <10,4,0 The Raider>'s <11,-1,3 display> is so large that <12,1,1 my thumb> can't reach <13,1,1 parts> of <14,-1,3 the screen> when I'm using <15,4,2 it> with <16,1,1 one hand>. While I think that <17,14,3 the screen> is too big I must say <18,14,2 it> looks fantastic. <19,14,2 It> has <20,-1,3 great viewing angles>, <21,14,2 it>'s bright, very sharp, has <22,1,1 great contrast> with pleasing <23,-1,3 colours> and <24,14,2 it> works outdoors. Interestingly, <25,14,2 it> doesn't <26,1,1 photograph> very well so don't judge <27,-1,3 the screen quality> from <28,-1,3 my pictures>. <29,1,1 One thing> I hate about <30,-1,0 HTC Android phones> is that <31,30,2 they> place <32,-1,3 the buttons> too close to <33,-1,3 the edges>. <34,1,1 This> makes <35,32,2 them> more difficult to use because I'm always pressing <36,32,2 them> accidentally. Unfortunately, <37,4,0 the Raider> has <38,1,1 this problem> too. <39,-1,3 The front facing camera> has <40,-1,3 a resolution> of <41,40,2 1.3MP>. <42,39,2 It> can capture <43,-1,3 both still photos and video> - neither of <44,43,2 which> are very good. While <45,4,0 the Raider> seemed unappealing at first, <46,4,2 it> really grew on me. In <47,1,1 the end>, I can say that between <48,-1,3 its fast performance>, <49,-1,3 LTE>, <50,-1,3 great camera and software>, <51,4,0 the HTC Raider> is <52,4,2 a solid performer>. <53,4,2 It>'s <54,4,2 a HTC device> <55,4,2 that> I love to use.
I recently reviewed <0,-1,0 the LG Optimus 3D>. <1,0,0 The Optimus> has <2,-1,3 a 3D display> <3,2,3 that> doesn't require <4,-1,1 glasses> plus <5,0,2 it> had <6,-1,3 dual cameras> to capture <7,-1,3 3D images>. Now I have <8,-1,0 the HTC EVO 3D>. I like how <9,8,0 the EVO> is a little thicker than <10,-1,0 the HTC Sensation 4G>. <11,8,2 It> makes <12,8,2 it> easier to use. Still, I found myself accidentally pressing <13,-1,3 the menu buttons> a lot <14,13,2 them> a lot - especially when whenever I tried to use <15,8,0 the EVO> with <16,4,1 one hand>. <17,-1,3 The display> has <18,-1,3 a higher resolution> than <19,-1,0 the Galaxy S2> and <20,0,0 LG Optimus 3D>. <21,4,1 That> said <22,17,3 the display> isn't very good. <23,17,2 It> doesn't have <24,-1,3 very good colour>.
<0,-1,3 The screen> is awesome with <1,-1,3 a bright and beautiful display>. <2,-1,0 The Galaxy S5> has <3,-1,1 more options> and <4,3,1 freedom> than <5,-1,0 the Iphones>. However, <6,-1,3 the Touch Wiz interface> of <7,2,2 it> is very laggy. <8,-1,3 Camera> is slow. <9,8,2 It> takes <10,3,1 way> too long to <11,3,1 load> and by the time <12,8,2 it> loads, I have missed <13,3,1 the moment> I wanted to take <14,-1,3 a picture> of. Touch <15,-1,3 screen> almost too sensitive. <16,2,2 The phone> is almost a little too big for <17,3,1 my preference>. <18,3,1 It>'s hard to use <19,3,1 one handed>.
I would rate <0,-1,0 the Q10> <1,-1,1 five stars> but <2,-1,3 the camera quality> sucks. <3,0,2 It> has <4,2,3 a 2MP camera> like <5,1,1 the one> I owned before. I like that <6,0,0 the Q10> has a built in <7,-1,3 FM radio> where you just plug in <8,-1,3 headphones> and <9,7,2 it> works. I also like <10,-1,3 the flashlight>. <11,10,2 It> is strong. I like that <12,0,2 the phone> is smaller. Wherever someone says that <13,-1,3 the battery> sucks is wrong. <14,0,2 The Q10> has <15,1,1 all> of <16,1,1 the wrong descriptons> everywhere. Just listen to <17,0,2 this best phone> ever.
I don't like where <0,-1,3 the power button> of <1,-1,0 Lumia 920> is.  <2,-1,3 The battery life> is rather poor.  I charge <3,1,2 it> <4,-1,1 every night> and still have had <5,1,2 it> die on my twice in <6,4,1 less> than a month. <7,1,0 Lumia 920> takes <8,-1,3 great pictures>.  <9,-1,3 The screen> is very sharp and <10,4,1 it> is easy to watch <11,-1,3 videos> on. However, I want to admit <12,1,0 Lumia 920> is by far better than <13,-1,0 the iPhone>! Learn how to use, and <14,1,2 it>'s amazing!
I purchased <0,-1,0 this Tracfone LG840G> a few months ago. <1,0,2 It> really eats up <2,-1,3 the battery>. I have to charge <3,0,2 it> every day. <4,-1,3 The screen> leaves a lot to be desired because of <5,4,2 it> not being <6,-1,3 super fine resolution>, but <7,4,2 it> is clear enough. <8,-1,3 The camera> is <9,-1,1 only 2 megapixel> and I thought that <10,8,2 it> would be <11,8,2 poor quality>, but even on <12,9,1 the computer>, <13,-1,3 the photos> look decent. <14,0,0 This Tracfone LG840G> is <15,0,2 just an inexpensive phone> with <16,9,1 decent features>. Good enough for me, but I will certainly try <17,9,1 something> different when <18,0,2 this one> dies. If you have <19,9,1 any questions> I will try to answer <20,9,1 them>.
I have <0,-1,1 some problems> with <1,-1,0 the LG 800G>, so I ordered <2,-1,0 this Tracfone>.  <3,2,0 The Tracfone> is easier to use than <4,1,0 the 800G>.  I have had <5,0,1 no problems> with <6,2,2 this one>.  I should have bought <7,2,2 it> first.
I was using <0,-1,0 the LG 800G> for <1,-1,1 a while> and I was very annoyed by <2,-1,3 the poor touch screen>. I was over <3,1,1 the fence> whether upgrading to <4,-1,0 this newer LG 840G> or not. Since <5,-1,3 the price> of <6,4,0 the LG 840G> has dropped quite a lot recently and so I decided to give <7,4,2 it> try. Wow, I am so delighted to say that <8,4,0 this LG 840G> is <9,4,2 a much better touch screen phone> than <10,0,0 the LG 800G>. <11,4,2 It> is very responsive and <12,-1,3 the texting> is so much easier. If you are considering <13,4,0 this LG 840G>, don't waste your time just buy <14,4,2 it>. You'll love <15,4,2 it>.
