I am very pleased with the phone we received.  It is a genuine Samsung S3.  I purchased this for my wife, she took it to the ATT store where they plugged in a sim card and set it up within 5 minutes.  No problems at all.  It has performed flawlessly even after being dropped on our tile floor. I even like some of the displays better than my S4 which is probably associated with the S3 operating system.  The price was in line with other sellers. The phone is shipped right away. I had read a number of reviews on this product advertised elsewhere on Amazon and was concerned about receiving a clone or refurbished phone as described by some other buyers.  However, I think that reviews may get bundled under specific product names so I suggest you just be sure what is being advertised for sale by the specific seller.  This ad was for a new S3 SGH-I747 (US model) ATT phone and that is exactly what we received.
The Samsung Galaxy S3 is one of the best phones I've ever used. I absolutely love the phone and the photo quality it has.
I've had my N8100 for about two years.  Dropped it on pavement, concrete, wood floors, etc. at least 30 times so it has a ton of scratches but it's held up very well.  My 2-year old has chewed on it, licked it, smacked it, etc. -- still no problems.  Signal has been solid, intuitive usability is very good.  My standard battery was great for the first 20 months (several hours of talk time, a week of standby) and just now is needing a charge every other day. I'll definitely buy a Sanyo again.
I have had the Sanyo 8100 phone from Sprint for about 14 months.  After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part. I have not dropped the phone or done anything else to warrant all the damage.  The hinge to flip open the phone has completely broken, first just one side broke and pretty soon the entire thing broke.  Then just yesterday the display completely stopped working as well.  According to Sprint, I am not eligible for a new phone for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get a new phone that will probably just break after a year.  I'm completely dissatisfied.  This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think this Sanyo 8100 is the worst purchase I have ever made in my adult life. From day one I had problems with reception, with the volume and with a constant "SIM Card Dislodged" error message. It only got worse over time. The display is essentially impossible to read in sunlight or even interior light brighter than a 60-watt bulb. The photos are awful. I've had the phone barely a year and it has essentially stopped working now. It'll be a cold day in hell before I give Sony Ericsson any more of my money.
This Sanyo 8100 is an excellent phone.  It has a very good color screen, it is well designed, the camera is pretty good for a phone, and it has numerous features.  For example, if you have a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC with an IR sensor, you can transfer phone numbers, to-do items, and more.  You can also record sound, apply themes to your background, and surf the web.  The phone has a very nicely laid out case and menu that is easy to navigate.  It also has a very quality feel when you hold it in your hand.  The only very minor problem with this phone is that the case smudges easily.  Sony includes a nice cloth to wipe it down with.  Besides that, this phone is incredible.  I got two of them under a family plan with ATT and have not been disappointed.  The price is ok, so I would give this phone a 5 out of 5.
The E105 looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about it is the ease of use. I do not have the time to tinker with a gadget for an hour to find out how a particular thing works. With this phone, it is really easy to browse through the menu and find out what I am looking for. The PDA feature is also great. If you use your PDA strictly for business purposes, now you can easily do without it as the phone keeps track of all your appointments and phonebook just fine. The Bluetooth headset I installed also works fine and if the device is on, any call is transferred to the headset automatically. Overall, the phone is a good purchase but I am a little skeptical about AT&T service. From what I have seen, the coverage seems pretty limited (and if you call the customer service for any reason, expect to be on hold for a long time - about 10-20 minutes).
Previous to purchasing the E105 I was an S105 owner.  I loved that phone, but I had my pet peeves about it, the keys being connected on the keypad made it difficult to dial at times but as long as I wasn't driving this wasn't really an issue.  Yes it was hard to see the screen in daylight but I don't expect to see a crystal clear picture on a cell phone, they aren't mini laptops folks.  Although it was hard to read, it wasn't impossible.  Unfortunately, I went to a concert and lost that phone and replaced it with the E105.  I have no complaints, I live in a basement apartment and the S105 wouldn't get service, but the E105 gets one bar and picks up all my calls crystal clear.  I can hear the caller on the other line perfectly, my boyfriend has one as well and I can hear the whole conversation if I am sitting next to him in a room with mild background noise.  I haven't had any problems with the screen going black, only when the phone goes idle but you can change that option from the menu.  Overall I am pleased with this phone up to date, we'll see if it holds up.
I first fell in love with this E105 because it was compact and lightweight.  That's about all I love about the phone right now.  It has really bad reception, not to mention weird background noises on both incoming/outgoing calls.  T-Mobile sent a replacement after I told them of the problem, but it's still the same.  I would buy another phone right now if I had the money.  The wallpapers provided are not the best, and neither are the ringtones.  Sometimes there is a delay for the screen to show up when you flip for opening the phone. The phone is a nice organizer though.  Alarms are loud as well as the ringtones.  Screen is pretty bright.  Buttons are nice and crisp.  That's about all the good features of the phone.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone to buy this phone.
I've had the E105 for about 2 weeks now and I must say it is one of the best phones I've owned.  The included ringers are truly embarrassing to play in public, but it's easy to download new and free ringtones with the free WAP access that T-Mobile includes. The rings are very loud though, and the sound quality is superb... my ringer is currently a song with the voice and all! The sound quality is great, but I guess that depends on your location and service in your area.  T-Mobile includes free basic WAP browsing which I use every day on this phone, and for the people who can't access their favorites in T-Zones... all you have to do is hold down the pound button and your favorites will pop up. The battery life is mediocre, but I can't really complain since I'm always making a call, playing games, or browsing the web.  Overall this is an excellent phone. The people who complain about this phone really need to do their research before they blab. I downloaded new games, backgrounds, and ringtones for free.
I just received my E105 the other day and I must say that I'm more than impressed.  It is much smaller than it looks in the pics and has steel casing.  I was always worried about dropping a flip phone and doing extensive damage.... nothing to worry about with this baby.  The 65,000 color LCD is bright and clear!  There aren't the best song selections for ringtones, but the polyphonic sound is incredible and loud.  If you are looking for a phone with good reception, a stylish look, and a colorful screen, this is the one for you. It doesn't have tons of features like some of the other Samsung models, but who uses all that crap anyway.  I'm very satisfied!
The E105 is a great phone, I used it with my Cingular sim and had no problem with it. I switched to a prepaid plan and it works great. The camera is better than some phones I have seen. The 64MB memory stick is good for pics and music. The bad is you can't get it from any carrier in the states, only online.
After my Motorola V180 had acted up on me and frozen all the damn time, I had to get a new one and the Samsung X495 doesn't disappoint. The only bad thing about this phone is that I can't access the internet. Reception is great, and the battery life is long - it charges in two hours which is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have excellent reception. The speaker phone is superb, not loud, it is so clear, but you have to use it with the phone open. It is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. It is the perfect girl phone. If you are looking for a basic phone that actually works, this is the phone you have been waiting for!
I got this Samsung X495 because the price was great, and it was easy to hold in my hand. This is my first cellphone, and I love it! I'd recommend it to anyone! A must-have for everyone who is getting their first cellphone. Easy to use, but you have to read the instruction manual first to learn about all of its features. Nice and bright screen with a nice loud ringtone. I hope you choose this phone if you're unsure of which Verizon Wireless cell phone to buy.
I am totally in love with this Motorola V300. This is the first phone that I could use without worrying if the signal is going to drop. It is so much more reliable and lighter than Z500. You plus it when you change faceplates, you don't have to worry about all the dust and faceplate slipping off. Sure it has a very sensitive camera button but I find it entertaining to see what pictures I have taken by accident. That's just me but oh well. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
I really like this V300.  It is cute, it is little, it's perfect for a young woman.  I had a Pocket PC prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't a mp3 player (i have an iPod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a PDA (i have a PALM TX) … it's just simple and cute. It's Bluetooth compatible... although doesn't work that great with my Bluetooth, but I'm not sure if it's the headset or the phone. The ringer on it is super quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  I'm grown accustomed to "listening" for the vibrating feature instead. I like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list. I can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and it's comfortable. Sound quality is good, on both ends I dig it.  I'm sure you will too.
ok, I have had Verizon for less than two years and this V300 is my third phone.  It is fairly new so I have no complaints as of yet.  The reception is a lot clearer than the last one I had.  The fact that it has a camera is even greater.  I love taking pictures so this was perfect for me.  The picture quality isn't the best, but for a camera phone it is pretty good compared to the others I have seen. The buttons of the phone are larger than some so I don't have trouble hitting the wrong buttons.  I haven't had any difficulty with the battery at all, in fact the battery seems to last quite a bit longer than the last two phones I had.  I am looking forward to the next 2 years with this phone.
I got my V300 a few days ago and it is way better than the other one I had.  I do have to say that the features are awesome!  They are easier to use than my old phone. The camera is easy as pie to use.  It has a lot of memory. On the screen you can put pictures that you take with the camera option. Or you can download wallpapers for your background.  It is such a nice phone. You can store a lot of contacts in the contacts list. Basically I would recommend this phone for anyone.
I upgraded my phone two months ago from a Motorola V300 to this Nokia 6101 because I wanted a radio and a larger keypad. After one month, the radio no longer worked, the battery dies when it claims to be fully charged, it takes three tries to get it to connect when making a call, and sometimes the phone just freaks out and resets itself while you're in the middle of texting or surfing the web. It's flimsy. I've had my V300 for two years and everything still works on it. The Nokia 6101 has a lot of issues.
I have owned the Nokia 6101 since late October 2005. I absolutely love it! I wouldn't trade it for the world. My boyfriend even wanted me to trade it to get a Motorola Razr V3 like he has, which does have its own set of great perks, but I love my phone. There are a few games on there, the camera quality has great clarity, the FM radio works perfectly, and it has great reception on T-Mobile's GSM network. You can also use the recorder to record your own ringtones. It's great!
I recently purchased this N6101 and it is so much better than the last one I had! The only problem I've had so far is that it froze up once which can be fixed only by putting the battery back in.
This N6101 is awesome and has great features! I have had it for a year and it hasn't given me a problem once! The ringtones are awesome! The camera quality is great and it has cool games that are fun that you can order. This phone really lets you show your style with features that let you pick your phone colors and online shopping for ringtones and wallpaper! It lets you adjust the phone volume and ringtone volume to your liking and the T-zones online shop has all the best artists and songs that gets everyone dancing, like Rihanna, Chamillionare and a lot more! So, if you want a reliable phone that lets you personalize and just be you, with so many cheap plans to choose from, then you should get the Nokia 6101 Phone (which is T-Mobile of course) because it is the best!
This Nokia 6101 is excellent.  The best I've had as far as reliability and signal - may be partly because of Cingular, too.  The buttons are a little hard to get used to, but it doesn't take long.  The screen is clear and easy to read, the battery stays charged for a good amount of time (especially if you don't use it to call anyone), and it is just an overall good phone.  I totally recommend it.
The Y210 is a 78-dollar phone. It is the cheapest Android phone you can buy. The plastic screen shows a lot of reflections and gets oily very easily. I haven't had a chance to use it under direct sunlight yet. You won't confuse it with the HTC One's display but it's actually not a bad display. The plastic on the back is hard and unpainted. It reminds me of the dash on my car. Still, overall the Y210 doesn't feel cheap. It doesn't creak or shift much when you squeeze it. One refreshing thing about the Huawei Ascend Y210 is that its small size makes it very easy to use with just one hand.
Besides the super high resolution, the GS4 display is simply better than the GS3 when it comes to colour and more importantly outdoor performance. The GS4's display is much easier to live with. While its colour is still slightly cool, it's much more normal looking, which will make it much easier to live with. Outdoor performance is a quantum leap forward over the GS3. The GS4's screen works much better than GS3'. It is good enough although it not as good as the iPhone 5 or HTC One display in this sense. Under the sun, you don't really lose any functionality. I'd say the GS4's is the best Super AMOLED display yet. It ís the best one since the Galaxy S2's.
Again, you can see what a difference the change in resolution makes with the Rugby. Even though the DEFY has a lower resolution screen, its GPU is much weaker than the one in the GS3 and Rugby. I still need to run my battery benchmarks but the Rugby has a relatively large 1850mAh battery and a sort-of-small 4” display so it should be able to make it through the day. Sound quality is good. It sounds clean and natural. Maximum earpiece volume is just slightly lower than my iPhone 5 so it's good in this regard. The speaker is very loud. You'll never miss any calls (unless you turn it off).
The Rugby LTE is a really niche product that doesn't have any competitors. While it lacks the bling of the GS3, it's fast. The screen isn't huge but I don't think it's too small. It is a good compromise since a bigger screen might make the Rugby too big. As for the price, it's a little harder to say. Since the Rugby is such a niche product, there isn't much to compare its price with. You can say that a Nexus 4 is a better deal but once you dunk a Nexus 4 in water or drop it on concrete, it'll probably be worth far less than the Rugby. After all, the Rugby is more powerful than the DEFY PRO and Xperia Go. It should be priced higher than them, right?
The X Plus have beats logos on it. However, HTC has clearly done some work on the X Plus in the headphone department. The X Plus's headphone is much louder than the X. It's clearly louder than the X although it is not as loud as the 8X I just reviewed. It's loud enough that you might need to get new headphones if you want to your listen to music at maximum volume.
The One X Plus has 64GB storage but, since the GS3 has a microSD card slot, it's easy to add a 64GB card to it. Where the shines of the One X Plus is its display. It just beats the GS3 at pretty much everything except for black levels. It's better in the sun, it's brighter and it's less grainy. The GS3's strength is its software. While Touchwiz isn't perfect, it feels more advanced than Sense. It also has 2GB of RAM which makes a huge difference when it comes to multitasking.
The 8X camera focuses slightly faster than the Lumia 920's. If you look closely at the 8X's pictures, the 8X camera captures more detail than the 920. So, given ideal conditions, it can take decent pictures. Maximum earpiece volume is decent though it's not as loud as my iPhone 5. Sound quality is good. It's clean-sounding with little hiss. The built-in speaker sounds fine but it's not very loud.
I tried this SE out today and I think it is a great phone. It's fast like my IPhone 6s but smaller, I liked the IPhone 5s size. I had the IPhone 5s and loved it but then updated to the IPhone 6a. The SE looks just like the IPhone 5s but with more speed. The camera is like my IPhone 6s. So if you want to go back to having a phone that fits in your pocket, this is the one!
I love my Note 3, it's bigger than my S3 but it's not as big as the mega phone but it's just right for me, I haven't learned everything about the phone but I do love the pen that comes with the phone, it does a lot. The camera is nice and much clearer.
The Note 3 is a lot bigger than my HTC EVO but somehow it's lighter. It's very fast and has so many features that an IPhone5 can't touch. I love the camera features and it takes great pictures. This is the best smart phone on the market.
Bought the Nexus 6 during black Friday to replace my aging S4. Everything about it is better than the S4 except video recording. The Nexus 6 has a horrible video camera. It cannot focus on moving objects. I like to take videos for Instagram and this phone is absolute trash when it comes to videos. It constantly tries to focus and this leads to blurry videos. Besides the video problem, the phone is great. The phone has longer battery life than the S4 and also much faster.
I was a bit worried that the phone would be too big. Honestly, The Nexus 6 is a bit bigger than most phones but I can tell you that within 5 minutes I got use to the size and I absolutely love my phone. The screen is big enough for everything and the speakers are awesome. I am happy I made the decision to get this instead of the Nexus 5. I don't think I need a phone smaller than the Nexus 6 right now.
Honestly, I love the Nexus 6 but sometimes the speaker volume is very low even when it's turned up. It happens even when I am in a very quiet place. Also my battery does not last for 24 hours, it last for about 6-8 hours. Otherwise, it charges super fast, takes great pictures and overall is very fast.
I got the Nexus 6 for my mom and it's really awesome. The display quality is great. The screen size is big. The battery life is very good. No bloatware--just Android in its pure form. HD Audio Calling on T-Mobile works like a charm. Front facing camera quality could be better but at this price point it's very acceptable. Rear facing images are good but not great when compared to leading flagships phones. Most people will be very satisfied with the image quality. I give it an 7.5 per 10 compared to an IPhone 6S.
I've been using this Nexus 6 for about 4 weeks and I have to write to say that I love this phone completely. It is big and I love the front facing stereo speakers. This Nexus 6 beats the S4 hands down, of course, and the Nexus 6 is better than the OnePlus One. I'm pleased with this phone.
I don't even know where to start, I love everything about this Nexus 6. It makes my old Samsung galaxy S4 look and feel like a joke. Excellent battery life, and I mean excellent. Beautiful screen. Quality dual speakers. Impressive camera. Honestly, the Nexus 6P is worse than the Nexus 6. I use this phone, and I couldn't be happier.
I love this Nexus 6! I got it a few weeks ago. The Nexus 6 is so much better than my Galaxy S4. It runs Android very smoothly and the screen size is amazing. I had to get used to the Nexus 6 but having a 6 inch screen makes it so much easier to type emails and see apps. I am very glad I got this phone and would recommend it to anyone who is looking and trying to figure out what kind of phone they want. I also love how fast the charging is with the charger. The phone can be very low on battery and charge up to full in less than 2 hours. So far, it is an amazing phone!
Nexus 6 is awesome, but the reason for the 4 stars is that there is no Wifi calling, which is a feature that is available if purchased through TMobile. Where we live, it's almost essential, so not having that feature meant a lot to us. If that's not important, it is a wonderful phone. Screen is crystal clear and the calls of Nexus 6 are a lot crisper than the Nexus 5. Great phone!
I purchased the Nexus 6 after having continued issues with my Samsung Note. My Note had reached its limit. I've been using the Nexus 6 for about three days. It is lightning fast compared to the Note. The Nexus 6 is a little faster than the Blackberry Passport I use for work. It really works well the streaming data. And the Nexus 6 makes calls and picks up signal better than the Note. It holds a charge well, but I do find myself charging when I get home from work. But with the super fast charging, it is really no big deal. The camera is decent enough. Pictures are decent but the interface is a little clunky. In general, I really love this device.
A 4.5" display sounds nice on paper but for me it's too big. The problem is, that I prefer to use my phone with one hand. It is one of the reasons why I like to use an iPhone. The Raider's display is so large that my thumb can't reach parts of the screen when I'm using it with one hand. While I think that the screen is too big I must say it looks fantastic. It has great viewing angles, it's bright, very sharp, has great contrast with pleasing colours and it works outdoors. Interestingly, it doesn't photograph very well so don't judge the screen quality from my pictures. One thing I hate about HTC Android phones is that they place the buttons too close to the edges. This makes them more difficult to use because I'm always pressing them accidentally. Unfortunately, the Raider has this problem too. The front facing camera has a resolution of 1.3MP. It can capture both still photos and video - neither of which are very good. While the Raider seemed unappealing at first, it really grew on me. In the end, I can say that between its fast performance, LTE, great camera and software, the HTC Raider is a solid performer. It is a HTC device that I love to use.
I recently reviewed the LG Optimus 3D. The Optimus has a 3D display that doesn't require glasses plus it had dual cameras to capture 3D images. Now I have the HTC EVO 3D. I like how the EVO is a little thicker than the HTC Sensation 4G. It makes it easier to use. Still, I found myself accidentally pressing the menu buttons a lot them a lot - especially when whenever I tried to use the EVO with one hand. The display has a higher resolution than the Galaxy S2 and LG Optimus 3D. That said the display isn't very good. It doesn't have very good colour.
The screen is awesome with a bright and beautiful display. The Galaxy S5 has more options and freedom than the Iphones. However, the Touch Wiz interface of it is very laggy. Camera is slow. It takes way too long to load and by the time it loads, I have missed the moment I wanted to take a picture of. Touch screen almost too sensitive. The phone is almost a little too big for my preference. It's hard to use one handed.
